At the gala of powerful Alistair Sterling, my world collapsed.
Laura Coy, my husband Tim’s true love, stood sobbing, accusing my brother Leo of assault. The elite whispered, "Laura was Sterling's chosen fiancée. That White boy is out of control!"
Respecting our family ties, Sterling ordered Leo to marry Laura instead of pressing charges. But Tim enacted his own justice: before everyone, he shattered Leo's legs with a chair, telling me, "We must appease the Sterlings, or they'll ruin our family."
Months later, Laura had a baby boy. Leo, wheelchair-bound, screamed his innocence, but no one believed him. Desperate, he took the infant to demand a public paternity test. As he left, Tim struck him from behind with a vase.
I screamed, but Tim choked me, hissing, "Think of the scandal and the baby." Carrying our child, I died.
I awoke again at the Sterling gala. This time, I tied my brother up and locked him in a storage room. Yet Laura Coy was still weeping, still claiming she'd been assaulted.
…
Laura stood there, wrapped only in Tim’s suit jacket, with suspicious red marks blooming across her exposed shoulders and legs. She hid her face, her sobs echoing with practiced misery.
"I've disgraced Mr. Sterling's trust! I can't bear to live!" she cried, lurching toward one of the marble pillars as if to end her own life. "Tim, don't stop me! Just let me die!"
Several society matrons rushed to restrain her, their faces a mixture of pity for her and disgust for me.
Their glares were like daggers.
"Has Leo White completely lost his mind? Did he pick up these disgusting habits overseas?"
"His family has a little prestige, sure, but to touch someone the Sterlings have chosen? He's spitting in the face of the most powerful man in the city!"
"Miss Coy was supposed to marry the Sterling heir next month. This has ruined everything!"
I glanced at my husband, Tim Thorne, who was shielding Laura, his eyes burning with fury as he stared at me. I fought back the bitter, knowing smile that threatened to curve my lips.
Pushing through the crowd, I walked straight up to Laura.
"Miss Coy," I said, my voice cutting through her performance. "Look at me. Are you absolutely certain the man who did this to you was my brother?"
Laura flinched, her weeping growing more frantic. "Miss White, I know you love your brother, but how could any woman lie about something like this? I just… I don't want to live anymore!"
She struggled again, a damsel in deep distress, held back by the gentle hands of the other women.
Tim strode forward and yanked me aside, his grip so tight it felt like my wrist would snap. His face was thunderous, his eyes blazing.
"Elara, your brother commits a disgusting, animalistic act, and instead of dragging him here to apologize, you come to intimidate his victim?" His voice was a low, furious growl. "Your father's legacy, his good name—you and your brother are dragging it through the mud!"
The pain in my wrist was sharp, but the cold laughter in my heart was sharper.
Half an hour ago, I personally bound and gagged Leo and secured the storage room with three separate locks. Did he magically teleport back here to assault Laura?
I met Tim's furious gaze without flinching. "Tim, are you sure? Are you absolutely certain it was my brother who did this?"
His jaw tightened. "I saw him with my own eyes, Elara! I saw that bastard putting his hands all over Laura! I knocked him out myself to save her. You think I don't recognize my own brother-in-law?"
A sliver of doubt pierced my resolve. Tim’s certainty was unsettling. Had Leo somehow escaped?
"Mrs. Thorne, how long are you going to bully this poor girl?" a prominent matriarch snapped at me, her voice dripping with condescension. "You are the wife of the Thorne Corporation heir! You should be protecting your husband's family name, not defending the trash in yours. You are unfit to be the lady of the Thorne house!"
"Or what?" another chimed in. "Do you want Tim to just look the other way while you and your delinquent brother drive Miss Coy to her death?"
Tim shot me a venomous look. "Elara, stop embarrassing yourself!"
I let out a cold, humorless laugh, my gaze sweeping over the self-righteous faces of the city's elite, all of them eager to join the chorus. "It seems that no matter what really happened tonight, all the filth was destined to be thrown at my brother."
"You!" Laura looked as if I had struck her. Fresh tears rolled down her cheeks, making her look exquisitely fragile. She bit her lip, her voice trembling. "I have always lived an honorable life. I never wanted to climb the social ladder! And now you're calling me a shameless, conniving woman?"
"Fine! If the White family refuses to take responsibility, then I'll die right here and sever all ties to this world!"
She spun and ran toward the floor-to-ceiling windows, only to be caught and soothed by the gaggle of women.
"Miss Coy, don't do something so foolish!"
"It's all that vile White boy's fault!"
"You've suffered so much! You can't let that animal get what he wants!"
While they comforted her, they shot me looks of pure loathing.
"She was supposed to be marrying the Sterling heir, for God's sake."
"The Whites run a decent business, but do they really think they're in the same league? Why would a woman like Miss Coy need to frame them with her own reputation?"
Tim pulled me closer, his grip still bruising, his expression shifting to one of feigned concern. "Elara, stop this," he murmured, loud enough for others to hear his "reasonableness." "Just have Leo agree to marry Laura. Issue a public apology, offer compensation."
"If this goes to court," he whispered, for my ears only, "an assault charge alone will land him in prison for at least a decade. White Industries' stock will plummet. How will you answer to your board then?"
Last time, that mask of his had fooled me completely. I believed Leo had made a drunken mistake. Consumed by guilt, I handed over a major White Industries project to the Coy family as an apology and treated Laura like a queen.
And in return, she gave birth to another man's child seven and a half months later and destroyed my entire family.
A wave of nausea churned in my stomach. I ripped my arm from his grasp.
"You want my family to welcome Laura Coy into our home under a cloud of lies? In your dreams!"
The warmth vanished from Tim's face, replaced by a chillingly familiar darkness. Before he could respond, Laura's father, Mr. Coy, stormed into the room, his face a mask of fury.
Without a word, he marched up to his daughter and struck her, a sharp, ringing slap that sent her stumbling to the floor, blood trickling from her lip.
"You are still making a scene in a place like this!" he roared. "Get home, now! I'll book you a flight. Go die abroad for all I care, just stop shaming our family!"
Two bodyguards moved to grab Laura.
"You don't have to touch me," she sobbed. She snatched a fruit knife from a nearby table and, without hesitation, slashed it across her wrist.
The room erupted in chaos. There were screams, people rushing to stop her, and others grabbing me, their voices shrill with accusation.
"Mrs. Thorne! Are you just going to stand there and watch?"
"If it wasn't for your degenerate brother, would she be driven to this?"
"Can your family live with themselves?"
I watched the melodrama unfold, my face a cold, impassive mask. I saw the glint in Laura's eyes as she pressed the blade deeper. It wasn't the look of someone who wanted to die. It was the look of someone certain of victory. Blood welled up, crimson and stark against her pale skin.
The matrons shrieked. "My God! The White family is driving her to her death!"
Tim's face went white. He lunged forward, wrenching the knife from her hand. "Doctor! Get the family doctor in here, now!" He quickly undid his tie and wrapped it tightly around her bleeding wrist.
Surrounded by a worried crowd, Laura lay back, her eyes fluttering weakly. Her gaze flickered toward me, and in that fleeting moment, I saw it again: not despair, but triumph.
Once Laura was safely settled in a quiet corner, Tim stormed toward me, his eyes terrifyingly dark.
"Elara White!" he roared, and his hand flew up, striking me across the face with brutal force.
The slap echoed through the ballroom. The impact sent me staggering backward, and I fell, my head cracking against the sharp corner of a marble table. A searing pain shot through my skull as blood trickled down my temple. My cheek was on fire, my ear ringing, and my vision swam with black spots.
Tim stood over me, his finger pointed at my face, his eyes filled with a venomous hatred. "You are such a vicious bitch. You had to push her to the brink of death just to feel satisfied, didn't you? I, Tim Thorne, do not have a wife as evil as you. We're getting a divorce. Today!"
The crowd murmured in agreement. Some even looked pleased.
"Mr. Thorne is right! A wife with no sense of right and wrong is a curse!"
"Like brother, like sister. He's a thug, so what does that make her? I bet she was sleeping around before she got married!"
"Mr. Thorne and Miss Coy are so unlucky to have run into these two psychopaths!"
The vicious words rained down on me. They looked at me as if I were a murderer, one step away from being pelted with rotten fruit.
I swallowed the metallic taste of blood in my mouth and pushed myself up from the floor, my head throbbing. I faced them all.
"You need to catch them red-handed," I said, my voice shaking but clear. "Which one of you actually saw my brother assault Laura Coy?"
A stunned silence fell over the room.
Tim broke it with a cold laugh. "I see you won't give up until you're faced with irrefutable proof!"
He spun around and strode to a dark corner of the ballroom where two bodyguards stood watch over a bulky, black sack. He bent down, untied the rope, and reached inside.
With a flourish, he pulled out a custom-made men's lapel pin, exquisitely crafted and engraved with a small, stylized "V."
He held it up for everyone to see. "Recognize this? This was a coming-of-age gift for Leo White from his family. It is a one-of-a-kind design! No one else in the world has one!"
His eyes were like daggers as he threw the pin at me. It clattered at my feet.
"Elara White, what do you have to say now?"
My heart plummeted. A cold sweat broke out on my back. The pin… it was the one Leo was wearing tonight.
Did someone let him out of the storage room after I left? No, that's impossible. I told the guards not to move.
Mr. Coy spat in my direction. "The evidence is right in front of you! Are you still going to deny it?"
I clenched my jaw and met Tim's gaze, a bitter smile on my lips. "This is all very strange, isn't it? My brother and I have only been back in the country for a short time. We keep to ourselves. But today, of all days, the one day I specifically told him to stick by his brother-in-law and learn the ropes, this happens."
I raised my voice, letting the accusation hang in the air. "I want to know who was really with Laura Coy tonight, and who is trying to frame my brother and my family for their own filthy secrets!"
"You're talking nonsense!" Tim roared, a flicker of panic in his eyes that he couldn't quite conceal. Several of his friends rushed to hold him back, afraid he would lose control completely.
The crowd shook their heads, their disapproval now aimed at me.
"Elara! You've lost your mind! You'd slander your own husband to protect that animal of a brother?"
"She's completely shameless! She's trying to drag the Thorne family down with her!"
A few of the older women who had known my family for years tried to reason with me. "Elara, dear, just stop. Apologize to Tim. There's still a chance to fix this."
I shook them off. "Apologize? I've done nothing wrong!"
Someone in the crowd muttered, "Tim and Laura were childhood sweethearts. If they were meant to be, they would have married years ago. Why would she get involved with him now?"
The comment was like a tiny spark in a dry field. The mood in the room shifted. The looks directed at Tim and Laura were no longer just sympathetic; they were questioning, speculative.
One of the women tugged at my arm, her voice urgent. "You foolish girl! Your family is in the wrong here! If you keep this up and the police get involved, what will happen when they arrest your brother?"
An image from my past life flashed before my eyes: Leo, wasting away in a hospital bed, his legs rotting, his spirit broken. He had been the brightest star of White Industries, reduced to a cripple who couldn't even walk. The despair in his eyes as he faded away was a wound in my soul that would never heal.
I pulled my arm free. Better to go down fighting tonight than to be slowly tortured to death later.
I lifted my chin. "Since we can't agree, then let's call the police. Let them handle it!"
My voice rang out, silencing the room. "If my brother, Leo White, truly did something so monstrous, then whether he goes to prison, pays a fine, or faces a firing squad, he deserves it! The White family will not harbor a monster!"
Laura trembled, her eyes darting nervously toward Tim.
