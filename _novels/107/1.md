Declan pulled out a premium gold card and ordered a lavish meal worth over a hundred thousand with his friends. I was cleaning in the next room and could hear their conversation clearly.

"Declan, how long are you going to play with that young maid? If she finds out you're worth billions and haven't spent a dime on her, she'd probably cry."

"You don't get it, Declan's doing this to upset Adeline. Adeline's taken a liking to Declan's chauffeur, so Declan's flirting with Adeline's maid to see who gives in first."

"Do you really think Declan would fall for someone so insignificant?"

"But Declan's quite the romantic. To see Adeline all the time, he'd even work as a bodyguard for her family. Respect."

"And how's that young maid? Is she any good in bed?"

Their degrading words pierced my heart, leaving me wounded. Declan didn't utter a word, letting them speak about me in such vile terms. It was only then I realized the truth. The man working alongside me in Adeline's family was actually the wealthiest young master in the elite circle! The person he wanted to see wasn't me, but the heiress Adeline. He deceived my feelings and used my body because my status was lowly. Just like the chauffeur Adeline liked, we're all ants they could crush. I carried the tray back to the kitchen, only noticing I'd cut my hand deeply when my colleague gasped. Blood stained every step I took.

After composing myself in the kitchen, I called my advisor. "I want to go to Africa as an exchange student. Please give me this opportunity." I fought back tears, but my voice still trembled. Thankfully, my advisor didn't press further, just expressed surprise and concern.

"Zoe, have you really thought this through? The research in Africa is extremely challenging. You can't return for at least five years or see your family. Didn't you say your boyfriend is disabled, and you're worried about him?"

Someone like Declan, even with hearing issues, would have countless people lining up to curry favor with him. He doesn't need my concern. I replied firmly, "I've made up my mind. I'm going to Africa."

My advisor was pleased. "That's good. I was worried you'd miss this great opportunity. I'll register you now, and the flight is in two weeks."

"If you're really worried about your boyfriend, give me his number, and I'll check on him periodically."

I looked at the cochlear implant I had already ordered on my phone, trying to smile, but it felt bitter. "No need. We're planning to break up."

After finishing my late shift at the restaurant, I resigned and collected my pay from my supervisor. Returning to the mansion, Declan was already waiting in the room.

"Why are you back so late? Zoe, what happened to your hand? What have you been busy with? You look pale."

I pulled back my hand that he was examining closely. "Almost graduating, been busy."

Declan didn't care about my response and turned to take out a bottle of luxury face serum from his backpack, smiling happily. "I bought this with my salary for you. I saw other girls love it. Do you like it?"

I placed it on the coffee table, expressionless. "I like it."

He seemed surprised that I didn't even pick it up to look. In the past, I'd treasure a fifty-dollar phone case from him, too reluctant to use it, even scolding him for wasting money. Now, looking back, I was so foolish.

Declan cautiously asked, "What's wrong? Are you unhappy?"

I pretended nothing was wrong. "No, you don't need to buy me such expensive cosmetics. Didn't you say you were saving up to get married?"

Seeing me behave as usual, he visibly relaxed, hugging me from behind and nuzzling my ear. "Don't worry about saving money for me. I'll give you a good life. You can even bathe in luxury face serum."

I hid my scorn, pushed him away, and returned to the bedroom. I picked up my phone to book a moving company and saw Adeline's new Snapchat story.

"Thanks to someone for personally bringing me to the hotel." "But this presidential suite is too shabby. Next time, book a better one."
