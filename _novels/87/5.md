He really was fierce, even more than my father.

I didn't dare defy him.

When I came out in the shorts, the room was empty.

I saw him at the door getting takeout as I walked out.

He had only ordered one portion.

I sat next to him, watching as he opened a container of twice-cooked pork fried rice. My mouth started watering.

He glanced up at me. "Want some?"

"Mm." I nodded honestly.

"Too bad." He tossed down his chopsticks.

I fell silent.

Even if he wouldn't give me any, I couldn't just take it. I definitely couldn't overpower him.

"Do you know how much your father owes me?"

"Ten million dollars."

"So you do know." He laughed bitterly. "And you still want to eat my food? What, you want to add another $30 to that debt?"

I hadn't eaten in a day. All I could think about was the twice-cooked pork.

"Is that okay?" I looked at him pleadingly.

"In your dreams." He dragged out the words. "Don't think acting all pitiful will make me soft. That doesn't work on me."

"Okay." I swallowed hard and sat quietly beside him, not daring to make a sound.

He opened the takeout container and poked around with his chopsticks before cursing, "Tastes like crap."

Then he grabbed his cigarettes and lighter and went out to the balcony.

I watched silently as he smoked cigarette after cigarette, tilting his head back.

My stomach growled loudly, but he still hadn't come back inside.

I looked at the pork, then at my stomach. When he wasn't looking, I quickly grabbed a piece of meat with my hand and stuffed it in my mouth.

He turned back just as I did it. My heart stopped and I froze, not daring to chew.

But he just glanced at me before pulling out his phone to make a call, turning his back as he talked.

I finally breathed a sigh of relief.

Hunger won out over fear, and I kept sneaking bites of meat.

By the time he finished his call and walked back over, I realized I had eaten all the meat, leaving just rice.

"Where's the meat?" He squinted at me.

"I don't know."

"You don't know?" He stared me down, suddenly raising his hand-

I thought he was going to hit me. I wanted to move but was too scared.

But his fingers stopped at my lips, brushing away a grain of rice and holding it up.

Busted!

"Ate the rice too. Now, how are you going to pay back your father's debt?" He leaned back, regarding me coolly.

"Can't you make him pay?"

"He skipped town."

"Then...I'll pay it back?"

"You? How exactly? You really think a scrawny little thing like you is worth $10 million?"

"You..." I felt insulted but didn't dare get angry.

"Finish eating and get out. Don't bother me anymore." He stood up and stormed out, slamming the door.

Of course I wanted to leave. Only an idiot would stay after being told to go!

I quickly finished the rice and ran out as fast as I could.

But half an hour later, I was back at the apartment, bedraggled and defeated.
