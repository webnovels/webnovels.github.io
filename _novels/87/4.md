After showering, I had no clothes to wear. I searched the closet and found a t-shirt.

I couldn't find any suitable pants. Hearing voices outside, I didn't dare linger too long.

I had no choice but to go out.

When I walked out, everyone immediately stopped horsing around and stared at me - or rather, at my legs.

Ethan stared too, frowning as he abruptly stood up.

"What are you looking at? Never seen a woman before?" he yelled at the others.

"Boss...we weren't looking."

"Get out!"

The group grumbled as they left the mahjong game and filed out.

"You, get back inside." Ethan glared at me.

"I...okay." I didn't dare argue, turning to run back to the room.

I heard his footsteps behind me and frantically closed the door.

BAM! He kicked it open.

"Dressed like that?" He looked me up and down again. "Kids these days..."

"I'm sorry. I...I don't have any clothes." I explained shakily, not daring to move as he blocked the doorway.

"If you don't have pants, don't go out with bare legs." He leaned against the doorframe, staring at me.

"You know those guys out there are all wolves, right? They'd eat you alive if they could."

"I didn't know..."

"Well I'm telling you now. They're all single guys who haven't touched a woman in months or even years."

I'll admit, that scared me.

A tear slipped out before I could wipe it away.

"Why are you crying? Now you're scared?"

"..." I bit my lip, holding back tears.

"For crying out loud!" He chewed on his cigarette as he rummaged through the closet, finally pulling out a pair of athletic shorts and tossing them at my head.

"Put these on! And stop crying, or I really will throw you to the dogs. Got it?"

"Got it." I quickly started putting on the shorts.

"In the bathroom!" He stared at me and sighed. "I'm a man, and a bad one at that. Do you even know what you're doing?"

"Okay!" I ran to the bathroom with the shorts.
