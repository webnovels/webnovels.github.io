In the end, I was thrown into a swimming pool instead.

There was no sea anywhere near this remote area.

Half an hour later, I climbed out soaking wet and returned to my original spot, sitting quietly as I awaited my fate.

They were playing cards.

Ethan glanced at me, casually tossing down a card, but otherwise ignoring me.

The others started discussing me.

"Boss, she's from the city. Won't she catch a cold being all wet like that?"

"Yeah, city folk go to the hospital over a paper cut."

I sat nervously, barely daring to breathe.

"You seem so concerned. Want to take her as your wife?" Ethan snapped.

"Boss..."

"I thought you came here for money, not to pick up girls."

He shot the group an annoyed look.

They all fell silent.

He turned back to me. "Why are you just standing there?"

"Oh." I stood up uncertainly, moving to a nearby stool.

"Go take a shower. There's no hospital here if you get sick." He got up and lit a cigarette as he walked out, grumbling, "So high maintenance. Bathroom's on the left. Don't you dare wear my clothes!"

I replied meekly, "Okay."

He was so fierce.
