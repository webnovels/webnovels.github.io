I cried as I showered, but not because my father abandoned me. I cried because I somehow managed to learn how to swim in just 30 minutes.

My name is Olivia Young.

My father is a wealthy businessman who's been married over a dozen times. There are 20 children in the family, and I'm the dumbest one.

He never believed he could have produced such a slow, underdeveloped child.

Until one day, he laughed as he looked at my paternity test results.

"I knew I couldn't have such a stupid kid!"

But as he kept laughing, his face started turning green.

After that, I was cast aside.

My allowance disappeared. I lost my private room and was moved to the basement. Every day I got up early to cook, clean, and do laundry for the whole family.

I asked my grandmother, "Why doesn't Dad like me?"

She glared at me. "Go ask your mother."

I shook my head. Grandma's dementia was acting up again. My mom had been dead for 10 years.

From then on, I was careful with my words and actions, working hard without complaint, afraid of upsetting my father.

I thought that would be my life forever. But then I was kidnapped.

My peaceful existence was suddenly shattered.
