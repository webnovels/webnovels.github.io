Harrison Steele was dead.

Before the funeral, his wife, Scarlett Yeager, went through his belongings and found a thick photo album. The cover read, "My Love."

She flipped it open, but the memories captured inside didn't belong to her. Instead, they were all of Hazel Sloane, the young woman Harrison had adopted years ago.

Scarlett had always believed Harrison saw Hazel as more than a guardian's affection for his ward. But every photo of Hazel in the album—whether she was laughing, sleeping, or in tears—was filled with an unmistakable tenderness, the kind shared between lovers.

Then, she saw a photo of Hazel in a wedding dress, with a handwritten line beneath it.

"If I can't marry the love of my life, I may as well settle for anyone."

Scarlett's face turned pale as she took in the secrets Harrison had kept for years.

20 years of marriage, and in the end, all she had been to him was someone to settle for.

The funeral began soon after. People around her whispered their condolences.

"Try not to dwell on it. He's gone now. Just take the inheritance and live well."

"Yeah. Even though Harrison's company is in trouble with that drug lawsuit, he had more than enough assets. You won't have to worry about money."

But as soon as they said that, a lawyer stepped forward and said, "Mr. Steele left a will. He decided to leave all his assets, including real estate and investments, to Ms. Hazel Sloane."

Gasps filled the room. Then, suddenly, someone burst in.

"If all his money went to her, then who the hell is paying our medical compensation?"

It was the family members of those harmed by Harrison's faulty drug. Their eyes landed on Scarlett, and rage twisted their faces.

"That's his wife! If we can't get our money, then she can pay for it with her life!"

As they rushed forward, a sharp dagger plunged into Scarlett's chest.

Scarlett collapsed. The last thing she saw was Harrison's cold, indifferent gaze in the black-and-white photograph.

As her eyes shut, one final thought echoed in her mind, "If I had another chance, I would never marry you again, Harrison."

…

When Scarlett opened her eyes, she was lying in a disheveled bed. Before she could process anything, a cold voice rang in her ears, "I already called my parents. The wedding is in five days. Happy now, Scarlett?"

She looked up and saw Harrison. This Harrison was not the man in his 50s who had died. He was a younger version—early 30s, still in his prime.

Realization hit her like a tidal wave. She had gone back in time—back to the days before their wedding.

Their marriage had been arranged since childhood, but Harrison had never liked her. He delayed the engagement for years, turning her into the laughingstock of Dornwich.

Then, one night, Harrison got drunk. Scarlett happened to be there, and in a moment of chaos, they ended up in bed together. Harrison was convinced she had set him up. He resented her for it but felt obligated to go through with the marriage.

After they got married, he was cold and distant. But Scarlett had loved him with everything she had.

When his company was struggling, she gave him her entire family fortune. Harrison hated seeing her go out, so she quit her job and stayed home. He liked peace and quiet, so she never dared to walk too loudly at home.

She had spent over a decade treading carefully, only to earn a few rare smiles from him. And even those were fleeting.

She had thought he was just naturally distant. But now, she knew the truth. He had never been cold. He had simply given all his love to someone else.

Pain crawled through her chest like ants biting into her heart. But Scarlett forced herself to snap out of it. She looked up at the man before her.

"You don't have to take responsibility," she said calmly. "Let's call off the engagement."

She wasn't about to waste another lifetime on a man who didn't love her.

Harrison let out a short, mocking laugh. "Trying to play hard to get now?"

Scarlett froze.

Right. She remembered how madly she had loved Harrison in her youth. More than once, she had threatened to break off the engagement in a fit of anger, only to be persuaded back by his parents.

That was why Harrison had never believed she would actually leave him.

"I mean it this time," she started, but Harrison just turned and walked away.

Same as before. He never listened to a word she said.

Scarlett sighed. 

Never mind. Since she wanted to break off the engagement, all she had to do was tell the Steele family directly. There was something far more important to do first.

Scarlett picked up her phone and dialed a number.

"Mr. Houghton, is there still a chance for me to apply for Project Aether?"

Her teacher, Dylan Houghton, sounded thrilled on the other end of the line.

"Of course! You were personally requested for it. But Scarlett, as I told you before, this is a top-secret program. If you join, you'll have to stay at Nebula Aerospace Base for ten years. You also can't contact the outside world. Are you sure?"

Scarlett majored in aerospace engineering in college, excelling in her studies. Her graduate research focused on technology that was in high demand by the nation.

Right after graduation, she had received an offer to join the nation's aerospace program.

It had been her dream. But in her previous life, Harrison had proposed. After much hesitation, she gave up her dream to become his wife.

This time, she would live for herself.

"I'm sure," Scarlett said.

Dylan sounded thrilled. "Great! But the project starts soon. You'll need to leave in five days. Say your goodbyes to your family while you can."
