Joselyn Wright was known as the ultimate little miss goody-two-shoes in Azmarin's high-society circle.

The wildest thing she'd ever done was secretly date the sworn rival of her brother, Jarrett Wright, for three years.

Oh, and let him film her. Over and over again.

In a Maybach, Joselyn was completely bare, while Evan Lloyd remained impeccably dressed, with a phone resting beside him.

"Evan," she called out softly, "can you... stop recording?"

Evan paused for a fraction of a second before he let out a low chuckle. He lifted his head, his eyes reflecting her face. His gaze was laced with a hint of indulgence and teasing amusement. 

"What's wrong? Getting shy now? Relax. No one else will ever see these. They're just for me when I miss you. Babe, let me have this, yeah?"

The way he called her "babe" made Joselyn flush all the way to the tips of her ears. His voice, smooth and coaxing, wrapped around her like a spell. She couldn't bring herself to refuse him.

She didn't know how long it had been, but eventually, the car stopped shaking, and everything finally came to an end.

Evan straightened his clothes, fastening his belt with a lazy precision before glancing down at her. He reached out and ruffled her hair. 

"I've got a party to attend later. I'll have the driver take you home first, and I'll come over later, okay?"

Joselyn nodded and replied softly, "Okay."

After Evan left, Joselyn got dressed, still feeling a little dazed.

Just as she was about to call the driver, she noticed Evan's wallet on the seat. Without thinking, she grabbed it and hurried after him.

After confirming which private room Evan's party was in, she walked up to the door. It was slightly ajar. Just as Joselyn was about to step inside, a burst of laughter came from within.

"Evan, man, you were going at it so hard. When I walked in, I saw the whole Maybach shaking. What do you guys think? If Jarrett found out his sister was that wild with Evan, would he drop dead on the spot?"

Joselyn felt like she'd been struck by lightning. Every nerve in her body went numb.

"Hahaha! Evan and Jarrett have been at each other's throats for years. There's a reason they're called the Warborn Duo. Otherwise, Evan wouldn't have gone all out to screw him over. He staged a whole hero-saves-the-damsel act to rescue Joselyn and made her fall head over heels for him."

"Evan, you've been together for years. How many videos have you made? Must be over a hundred by now, right? When are you planning to release them? I'm dying to see what the little miss goody-two-shoes looks like stripped down under you. But more than that, I can't wait to see Jarrett's face when he finds out!"

Laughter erupted around the room. No one noticed the figure frozen outside the door.

Joselyn's mind went completely blank, a buzzing noise ringing in her ears.

Their words echoed in her head over again, growing louder and louder until they crashed like a deafening bell, threatening to shatter her skull.

Evan had staged the whole thing? He was dating her just to mess with Jarrett?

"Why so quiet, Evan? Back then, you approached Joselyn just to mess with Jarrett and make sure he'd never go against you again. Don't tell me you actually have feelings for her."

"Feelings?" The man who'd just been calling her "babe" sat back, raising his glass with a lazy smirk.

His voice was laced with mockery as he said, "Jarrett's my biggest rival. I only care about destroying him. I was just thinking about the perfect timing to release those videos. Maybe on Joselyn's birthday? I bet Jarrett's reaction will be priceless."

"Damn, Evan! Savage!"

Another round of laughter erupted. Their voices were filled with excitement and anticipation.

Joselyn's fingers trembled. Her legs felt weak; they could barely hold her up.

Suddenly, a waiter's voice sounded beside her. "Miss, are you going in?"

She jolted, snapping back to reality. She shoved Evan's wallet into the server's hands. "I-I'm not going in. Give this to Evan. Just say someone found it. Don't tell him I was here."

Then, she turned and ran. Tears blurred her vision as she fled into the night. Evan's cruel words echoed in her ears. "Jarrett's my biggest rival. I only care about destroying him."

Her chest tightened, a sharp, suffocating pain spreading through her chest.

So it turned out that he'd orchestrated their entire encounter from the very beginning.

Back then, despite Jarrett's objections, Joselyn had chosen to attend a university in Airedale because it had the best dance program in the country.

After graduation, she'd insisted on staying in Airedale, no matter how hard Jarrett had tried to convince her to return to Willesden. Their parents had spoiled her since she'd been a child, and Jarrett had always been the overprotective older brother. She'd wanted to prove she could build a life on her own.

Dance had been her whole world until she'd met Evan, the man everyone called Jarrett's sworn rival. For years, the two had fought over territory and business deals. Their rivalry was infamous.

And yet, it had been Evan who'd saved her. Twice.

The first time, Joselyn had been hit by a car. The driver had sped off, and the bystanders had hesitated, unwilling to get involved. 

She'd been on the floor, bleeding and crying out for help. Evan was the one who'd pulled up in his Maybach, scooped her into his arms, and carried her away like some kind of savior.

The second time, someone had drugged her drink. Just as she'd been on the verge of being violated, Evan had carried her away, saving her once more. That night, he'd become her cure.

The next morning, she'd woken up to find him standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, lazily buttoning up his shirt. When he'd turned around, those beautiful eyes of his had nearly stolen the breath from her lungs.

Evan had leaned down, slowly closing the distance. "I wanted to ask you this from the first time we met. Do you like me, little one?"

Her mind had buzzed, completely blank as she'd stared at his strikingly handsome face. She hadn't been able to form a single word.

He, on the other hand, had curled his lips into a smirk. "No? Then why do you blush every time you see me? You even stole a kiss this morning. If I remember correctly, the effects of the drug had already worn off."

Embarrassed, Joselyn had tried to escape, but he'd pulled her back once again. With a smile in his eyes, he'd captured her lips in a gentle, lingering kiss.

After that day, they'd started dating officially.

For three years, Joselyn had believed they were in love. So many times, she'd imagined taking Evan home to Willesden to meet Jarrett. She'd thought that, with her there, the two men could finally put their differences aside. Looking back now, she realized she'd been so stupid.

She had no idea how far she'd run. When the cold rain started pelting her face, her phone rang in her hand.

It was Jarrett. Joselyn took a deep breath and answered.

"Josie, I've set up the biggest dance studio in Willesden just for you. I even found you a fiancé. Break up with that guy already, will you? You know Mom and Dad don't want you marrying someone who lives far away. They just want you to stay in Willesden, close to them."

The moment Joselyn heard his voice, tears flooded her eyes.

She swallowed down the lump in her throat and nodded. "I'm sorry, Jarrett. I've made you worry all these years. I'll return to Willesden and meet the fiancé you picked for me."
