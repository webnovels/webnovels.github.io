The lights of the charity gala hurt my eyes.

I stood in a corner, my fingers unconsciously tracing the rim of my wine glass, my gaze scanning the room for Caleb Vance.

Julian's briefing material said he'd definitely be here tonight.

"Alone?"

A man reeking of alcohol leaned in, his eyes lingering unpleasantly on my exposed shoulder.

I took a half-step back, forcing a smile. "I'm waiting for someone."

"Waiting for who? Why don't you have a drink with me first?"

He reached out to put his arm around my waist.

"This lady clearly isn't interested."

A deep voice came from my side.

I turned, my breath catching in my throat.

Caleb Vance was even more striking than in his photos.

A chiseled face, eyes as deep as ink, and a perfectly tailored suit that accentuated his broad shoulders and narrow waist.

What surprised me most was the way he looked at me—with a restrained politeness, a stark contrast to the ruthless business shark Julian had described.

After the drunken man sheepishly left, Caleb gave a slight nod. "Miss Lin, I hope you weren't too startled?"

He knew my name. My heart skipped a beat.

"You know me?"

"Who in the business world hasn't heard of Mrs. Hayes?"

A slight smile played on his lips as he offered me a handkerchief. "You spilled some wine."

Only then did I notice the red wine splashed on my wrist from earlier.

As I took the handkerchief, I noticed a thin, long scar on his fingertip, strikingly different from Julian's pampered hands.

Wiping away the wine stain, I suddenly realized this was the perfect opportunity to approach him.

"Might I have the honor of a dance, Mr. Vance? As a thank you."

Caleb raised an eyebrow, seemingly surprised, but quickly extended his hand.

"My pleasure."

The music started, and his hand rested lightly on my waist, maintaining a respectful distance.

I'd expected to smell heavy cologne, but instead, I caught a hint of crisp cedar.

"Miss Lin's dance steps are quite professional," he suddenly said.

"I studied in college," I replied casually, but then froze.

How did he know I was dancing professional ballroom, not just a social dance?

Caleb seemed to sense my confusion, letting out a soft chuckle. "A guess. Your way of following the rhythm is quite unique."

When the dance ended, he politely escorted me back to my seat, not lingering.

I should have felt relieved, but a strange sense of disappointment washed over me.

"How's the progress?"

Back at the Hayes mansion, Julian was waiting for me in the living room.

"I've made contact. It will take more time."

I slipped off my high heels. My ankles were already chafed and bleeding.

Julian frowned. "Too slow. Hayes Corp. has a private reception next week. Find a way to get an invitation."

He stood up and walked closer, his fingers pinching my chin.

"Don't tell me you're getting soft? Remember, he might act like a gentleman, but he uses every dirty trick in the book behind the scenes."

I lowered my gaze. "I know."

Three days later, I used the excuse of following up on the charity project to arrange a meeting with Caleb at his company.

His secretary led me to his office, but then informed me he had an urgent conference call.

"Mr. Vance said you could wait here, or relax in the adjacent study."

The secretary said respectfully.

I chose the study.

The room was spacious and bright, with a wall-to-wall bookshelf filled with books and files.

As I looked closer, I suddenly found a plain black photo album tucked away in a corner.

Driven by an inexplicable impulse, I picked it up.

Turning the first page, my breath hitched.

It was me at eighteen, standing on a piano competition stage, smiling brilliantly.

Flipping through, there were nothing but clippings about me: college debate champion, charity performances, even candid shots of me feeding stray cats on campus.

"That was seven years ago."

Caleb's voice came from behind me, startling me so much the album slipped from my grasp.

He bent down to pick it up, gently brushing off non-existent dust.

"You... why do you have these?"

My voice trembled.

He gazed at the photos, his eyes incredibly tender.

"Because that day, your music made me want to live."
