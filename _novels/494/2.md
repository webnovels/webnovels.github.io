I agreed to the marriage.

For my father, for the Lin family, I had no choice.

The wedding was grand. The Hayes family valued their reputation, wanting even an unwilling marriage to be spectacular.

Julian drank a lot that day. He didn't even step into the bedroom on our wedding night.

For three years, I tried to be a perfect wife.

I memorized all his preferences, learned about his interests, and even endured his tabloid scandals.

I naively believed that if I was good enough, one day he would finally look at me.

The sound of water running in the bathroom broke my reverie.

I froze. Julian was back?

Pushing open the bathroom door, a rush of steam hit me.

Julian stood under the shower, water droplets sliding down his muscular back.

He turned off the water, grabbed a towel, and wrapped it around his waist. He frowned when he saw me.

"You're still awake?"

"It's our third wedding anniversary today."

I said softly, handing him another towel.

He took it and dried his hair, his expression completely flat. "Is it? I forgot."

My heart felt like it was pricked by a needle, but I was used to the pain by now.

"It's okay. Work is important."

Julian walked out of the bathroom, pulled out pajamas from the wardrobe, and changed. I stood there, feeling like a useless decoration.

"Right," he suddenly said. "There's something I need your cooperation with."

I looked up at him, surprised that he actually needed something from me.

"Caleb Vance has been trying to snatch a crucial project from Hayes Corporation recently."

His eyes flashed with a hint of malice when he spoke Caleb's name. "I need you to get close to him, and collect some... compromising information about him."

My eyes widened. "What do you mean?"

"It's simple."

Julian lit a cigarette, his tone as casual as if discussing the weather.

"We'll get a fake divorce first. That way, your approach to him won't raise any suspicion."

"With your looks, seducing him shouldn't be difficult."

I felt a chill run through me, unable to believe what I was hearing.

"You... you want me to use my body?"

"Don't put it so crudely."

He exhaled a smoke ring, his eyes filled with indifference.

"It's just business strategy."

"After it's done, we'll remarry, and your father's company will get more resources from Hayes Corporation."

I clenched my fists, my nails digging deep into my palms.

Three years. In his eyes, I was nothing but a tool to be used, not even deserving of basic dignity.

"What if I refuse?" I heard myself ask.

Julian smiled, and the smile sent shivers down my spine.

"Your father's new government project... seems to have some funding issues, doesn't it?"

The threat was unmistakable.

I closed my eyes, feeling a wave of dizziness. So, I didn't even have the right to say no.

"Fine, I'll do it."

I opened my eyes, my voice eerily calm.

Julian nodded, satisfied, and stubbed out his cigarette.

"The lawyer will be here tomorrow to handle the paperwork. Remember, it's just a plan. Don't take it seriously."

He pulled back the covers and lay down, turning his back to me.

I stood there, looking at the man who was legally my husband, and suddenly felt an overwhelming sense of unfamiliarity.

That night, I stood on the balcony, gazing at the distant city lights, and made a decision.

Since Julian wanted to play this game, I would play it to the very end.

Only, he would be the one to regret it in the end.
