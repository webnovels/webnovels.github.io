By the time we returned to the Sullivan mansion, it was already dark.

The hall was brightly lit, with my father sitting on the sofa reviewing documents.

Sophia was leaning against him, smiling coyly.

Seeing us enter, a flash of mockery crossed her eyes as she deliberately raised her voice, "Dad, sister has come back with her child."

My father looked up, his gaze falling on the child in my arms, his brow instantly furrowing, "You have the nerve to come back?"

Before I could speak, Sophia was already covering her mouth and laughing lightly, "Sister, you've certainly had an exciting life out there. Having a child out of wedlock, bringing back a little bastard, how scandalous if word gets out."

"Sophia!" my mother rebuked sharply, "Watch your mouth!"

But my father raised his hand to stop my mother, his eyes coldly fixed on me, "Whose child is this exactly?"

I took a deep breath, my nails almost digging into my palms.

Those memories I had deliberately buried came flooding back.

Three years ago, on that rainy night, I found Ethan Foster covered in blood.

I sent him to the hospital and cared for him day and night.

Ethan had lost all his memories due to the car accident.

I took care of him, accompanied him through rehabilitation. He always liked to hold my hand in the warm afternoon sun, saying softly, "Olivia, when I'm better, let's get married."

His palm was warm and dry, his gaze so focused as if I was the only person left in the world.

Later, as he gradually recovered, we lived in a small house by the sea.

He would brew coffee in the early morning and gently kiss my forehead.

He would also hold me in his arms during thunderstorms, saying "Don't be afraid, I'm here."

At that time, he was so gentle, unlike the cold young master of the Foster family, but just an ordinary man who loved me deeply.

But later...

His memory returned.

One morning, when I woke up, the bed beside me was already empty.

A check was left on the table, the amount so large it hurt my eyes.

He also left a note, saying he would come back for me.

I hated him for leaving without a word, so I burned the note and left that place.

After leaving, I found out I was pregnant.

I didn't want to abandon this little life, so I chose to give birth.

Three years later, the Sullivan family found me.

"Can't say it?" My father sneered, "You've completely disgraced the Sullivan family!"

"Disgrace?" My mother suddenly stood up, her voice shaking, "When you brought Sophia home back then, didn't you feel disgraced? Now you dare to blame Olivia?"

My father's face turned ashen, "How can that be the same? Sophia is my biological daughter!"

"And what about Olivia?" My mother's eyes were red, "Isn't she your flesh and blood? Your favoritism should have a limit!"

Sophia pretended to mediate from the side, "Auntie, don't be angry. Dad is just worried about sister's reputation..."

"No need for your fake kindness!" My mother pushed her away.

Sophia staggered a few steps, deliberately falling to the ground, tears instantly welling up, "Dad, I was just trying to calm Auntie down, but she pushed me..."

My father flew into a rage, raising his hand to strike my mother.

I rushed forward to shield her, but suddenly heard my child burst into tears.

"Mommy... I'm scared..." he tightly hugged my leg, his little face covered in tears.

At that moment, my heart felt like it was torn in two.

I crouched down and hugged him, my voice trembling, "Little Bean, don't be afraid. Mommy's here."

My father's hand froze in mid-air, finally dropping heavily.

He rubbed his brow wearily, "Go back to your room, don't stand here annoying me!"

My mother still wanted to argue, but I held her back and shook my head.

As I carried my child upstairs, Sophia's triumphant gaze stabbed into my back like knives.

Closing the door, my child nestled against my shoulder, sobbing softly, "Mommy, why doesn't Grandpa like us?"

I bit my lip hard, tears finally falling.

Why?

I wanted to know why too.

Why did Ethan leave without a word? Why did my father only have eyes for Sophia? Why did my child have to bear all this malice?

Outside the window, thunder rumbled, and raindrops slammed against the glass.

I held my child tightly, as if I could shield him from all the storms of the world this way.
