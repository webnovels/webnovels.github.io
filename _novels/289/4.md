The one who spoke was Adrian Knight, the mysterious intellectual from high school. When my dad sent out invitations, he had only symbolically given Adrian an invitation.

Yet, to my surprise, Adrian Knight, heir to the city's most prominent Knight Group, was attending this gala.

Adrian continued, his gaze falling on me without avoidance:

"Do you think you'd be where you are today without Chloe, without the Chen family?"
