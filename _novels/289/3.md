Late that night, Marcus quietly returned home. Though he was extra careful, I, having a purpose, still caught the faint scent of jasmine.

That floral scent, which I might have overlooked before, now felt like needles piercing my skull. I pressed a hand to my throat, forcing down the urge to vomit. My mind, however, was coldly calculating: I still lacked direct, irrefutable evidence of Marcus and Brittany's affair.

In the following days, perhaps due to his guilt, Marcus began to play the part of the devoted husband. To gather evidence, I decided, for the first time in ages, to cook him a meal and personally take it to his company.

You see, to avoid causing Marcus any trouble, my appearances at his company were rare. So, when I showed up at the front desk, the receptionist visibly flinched. On my way to Marcus's office, I heard hushed whispers:

"Has the boss's wife found out something? Why is she suddenly here?"

"Hard to say. Mr. Hayes has been quite reckless a few times. There was even a time he made Brittany hide in the inner office while his wife was right outside!"

Though my hand, holding the chicken soup, was pale from tension, I managed to maintain a smile as I entered Marcus's office.

At that exact moment, Brittany opened the inner office door. She saw me, startled, and instinctively pulled her collar up. I pretended not to notice the faint red marks on her neck, setting down the soup. I casually remarked to Marcus:

"Honey, there's a gala tonight. My dad's hosting. Will you come with me?"

I paused slightly, then turned to Brittany:

"Brittany, you should come too. Didn't you always say Marcus needed to train Brittany more? Many people will be there tonight, it could be a good chance for Brittany to network."

Brittany's eyes immediately lit up. Marcus feigned hesitation but eventually agreed.

At the gala that evening, seeing how effortlessly Brittany navigated the room, I knew Marcus frequently brought her to these events. Then, Mr. Campbell approached us with a female companion I hadn't met before. Suddenly, the woman spoke:

"Mr. Hayes, Mrs. Reed's necklace is truly beautiful tonight. I love diamonds too."

I froze. The one wearing the diamond necklace was Brittany, not me. In that moment, my anger flared, but I maintained my smile, though behind it lay endless coldness and resolve.

Mr. Campbell's face showed a flicker of embarrassment, quickly replaced by pity.

Marcus's expression remained unchanged, and Brittany puffed out her chest, the diamonds seemingly sparkling brighter under the lights.

Marcus offered no explanation. I excused myself, feigning illness, leaving the stage to Brittany and him.

Among the guests invited that day were Marcus's and my high school classmates. I had prepared a private room specifically for them.

Those high school classmates who had ceased contact after the Hayes family's bankruptcy were now fawning over the latest tech darling.

Perhaps my unassuming demeanor and my father's turning a blind eye had made Marcus drop his guard. Fueled by alcohol, Marcus, while toasting me, began to rant wildly in the private room I had arranged:

"Honestly, I love Chloe, but living with someone disabled for so long... it's just... so ridiculous having video calls and signing. It's too much."

He swirled his glass, continuing:

"And, whenever Chloe appears before me, I'm reminded that she lost her hearing saving me. Do you understand? It's a huge debt, too heavy to bear."

I had never used it against him. In fact, when Marcus decided to marry me, I had solemnly asked him:

"If it's out of guilt, then don't. I want a husband, not someone repaying a debt."

Back then, Marcus had knelt before me, tears in his eyes, signing with trembling hands:

"I've only ever loved you. It's only because I love you that I want to be with you. Chloe, please, marry me?"

My mind flashed back to him staying up for months, eyes heavy with dark circles, to quickly learn sign language.

I had sealed my answer with a kiss.

But things were different now.

Hearing his words, even though I had emotionally detached myself from Marcus, I instinctively clenched my hands.

Marcus didn't notice, but this scene didn't escape another person's eyes.

Marcus's cronies were about to continue their teasing, but suddenly a voice I never expected interrupted everything:

"Then what about your secretary? Before Chloe arrived, you two were kissing passionately."
