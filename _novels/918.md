After being released from prison after five years, the first thing Lawrence Reed did was to schedule a sky burial.  
“Mr. Reed, this is the sky burial service you have booked. After your death, your body will be transported to the mountains for the ceremony. You must first pay a deposit, with the remaining amount to be settled within two weeks.”
Lawrence nodded, pulled out a plastic bag from his faded jeans, counted the bills and coins he had saved up in prison, and finally paid the deposit with difficulty.  
He was diagnosed with cancer while in prison, and it is now in its late stages, with an estimated one month left to live.
He recalled that years ago, he and Aaliyah Bailey had made a promise to hold their wedding in Sunset City, with all the deities of the mountains witnessing their unwavering love.
Now that the wedding promise could no longer be fulfilled, letting him rest eternally in that sacred land would at least be a form of comfort.
The cost of the sky burial was not low. After leaving the institution, he went to a nightclub to apply for a job as a server to pay off the remaining balance.
With a criminal record, he couldn't find a legitimate job, and that place was a high-rolling club of vice in Peaker City, where the wages for waiters weren't bad either.
After giving Lawrence some instructions, the person in charge handed him a uniform and told him to start working that night.
After a brief training session, he carried the wine into the adjacent VIP lounge.
The room was dimly lit, with many wealthy young men and women playing games. Lawrence crouched by the coffee table, carefully placing the bottle down, and was about to turn and leave when that familiar, cool voice suddenly drifted over from nearby.  
His body stiffened, and he froze in place!
Sure enough, on the sofa at the high end of the room, Aaliyah sat surrounded by admirers. Her cold, elegant features glowed under the shifting lights, exuding an air of aristocratic arrogance.
Five years had passed, yet her appearance hadn’t changed at all. The only difference was a hint of icy detachment that kept others at bay.
Lawrence couldn't help but glance at her twice, only then noticing that she was nestled in a man's arms, and that man was his best friend, Jason Cox.
The two seemed to be discussing marriage.
“The wedding will be held at the seaside chapel as you like, with pink roses spread along the beach.”
“If you don't like the dress the designer created last time, I'll arrange for someone to remake it. Everything will be based on your preferences.”
Listening to that familiar voice, Lawrence’s thoughts drifted uncontrollably. Five years ago, he had been so close to becoming Aaliyah’s groom.  
They were childhood sweethearts and grew up together from a young age.  
When Lawrence’s parents died unexpectedly, it was Aaliyah who stayed by his side through those difficult times.
She rode her bicycle to school with him, stood up for him when he was bullied, and cared for him when he was sick.  
They naturally fell in love and took steps toward marriage, until the night before the wedding, when he accidentally killed Aaliyah’s mother in a car accident!  
He would never forget that night, when Aaliyah’s eyes were red with blood.
She cornered him like a madwoman, demanding to know why, if there was some reason.  
Lawrence had never felt so desperate. He looked up and smiled: “There was no reason. She saw me with another woman and threatened to tell you. In a fit of rage, I had no choice but to run her over.”  
He would never forget the look in Aaliyah's eyes at that moment.
Anger, hatred, and disappointment intertwined like an impenetrable net, completely ensnaring him, nearly suffocating him.
In the end, Aaliyah personally sent him to prison.
During his five years in prison, he often wondered if things would have turned out differently if he had revealed the truth.
But reason reminded him he couldn't do that.  
Because Aaliyah's mother had been suffering from severe depression, and on the eve of their wedding, her condition flared up, causing her to mistake the bodyguard for Aaliyah's father and have sex with him.  
At that moment, he had come to discuss wedding plans with Aaliyah, only to accidentally witness the scene.
Aaliyah's mother came to her senses, regretted her actions, and begged him not to reveal the incident.  
Though conflicted, he ultimately agreed to her plea.  
But unexpectedly, after he left and started the car, Aaliyah's mother felt unable to bear it, threw herself at his vehicle.  
Aaliyah had always been a pampered princess. If this scandal were to surface, it would deal a devastating blow to her and the Bailey Family.
People in their circle wouldn't view her in a reasonable way, and might even question her identity.  
So, for Aaliyah's sake, he had to bear the consequences alone and take full responsibility.  
Now that he was terminally ill, there was no need to reveal the truth.  
If she hated him, let her hate him. That way, when he left, he could do without hesitation, without any regrets.
As he trembled and was about to leave, someone suddenly called out his name from behind.  
“Lawrence? You’re out of prison!”  
He shuddered, dared not look at the sharp gaze coming from the person who spoke, and was about to leave when someone tripped him as he stepped out the door.  
He wasn’t prepared and collided with the coffee table, crashing heavily to the ground.
Several bottles of alcohol on the coffee table shattered as he fell, and his hands were cut open in several places, bleeding profusely.  
The private room erupted into laughter, and everyone stood up to scrutinize his disheveled appearance.
"Lawrence, it's really you. You came to work right after getting out of prison. You're really working hard!"
He kept his head down and said nothing, only reaching out to press his hand against his bleeding wound.
The person continued to speak.
“What are you standing there for? You spilled wine all over the floor. Hurry up and clean it up.”
“Remember, you have to kneel down to clean it.”
A burst of laughter echoed in his ears. He could only pull out a cloth from his apron, kneel on the ground, and wipe the wine stains over and over again.  
He didn’t look up, but he could feel Aaliyah’s hate-filled gaze coldly fixed on him.
Like a sharp knife hanging over his head, ready to deliver a fatal blow at any moment.
She hated him so much; seeing him suffer must bring her more joy than anyone else.
Hurriedly finishing the cleanup, he tried to stand up and leave, but the person in front of him wasn’t willing to let him off so easily.
“Think you can just leave? The wine you spilled is worth a fortune—what will you use to compensate for it?”
Lawrence clenched his fists in panic, dared not lift his head, and stammered, “I’m sorry, I really didn’t mean to.”  
“Do you think a simple ‘I’m sorry’ will suffice? You can’t afford to compensate me anyway. Here’s what we’ll do: don’t say that I didn’t give you a chance. If you crawl under my legs, this matter will be settled.”
The man finished speaking, then coldly laughed as he placed one leg on the chair, his mocking gaze fixed on him.  
The crowd burst into laughter, then joined in unison.  
“Crawl through! Crawl through!”  
He clenched his teeth, feeling his cheeks burn. The mocking glances of the crowd felt like knives piercing his back; he couldn’t escape.
He had no money to compensate him, and the man in front of him was clearly venting his anger on behalf of Aaliyah. Even if he didn't kneel, the man would find other ways to take revenge on him.  
During his five years in prison, dignity had long since lost all meaning to him.  
His vision blurred, and he almost bit his lip until it bled. Finally, in front of everyone, he knelt down with a thud in front of the man.
Just as he bent down to crawl between the man’s legs, the coffee table was kicked over violently, and a cold, piercing voice rang out.  
“Enough!”  
Suddenly, his arm throbbed with pain, and before he could react, he was dragged out.
In the dim corridor, Aaliyah pressed him harshly against the wall, her eyes filled with hatred and coldness.  
“Lawrence, are you really going to degrade yourself like this?”  
His back touched the cold marble, and his whole body shuddered involuntarily. He turned his head away, “You shouldn’t have stood up for me. How can your mother rest in peace if you do this?”
His words enraged her. She pushed him away forcefully. “Stand up for me? You’re overthinking it. I pulled you out here to make a deal with you!”
“You’re short on money, aren’t you? Tonight, you’ll stand guard outside my room all night, and I’ll pay you. From now on, you’ll stay by my side, and I guarantee the money I’ll give you will be more than what you earn as a hostess.”
Without waiting for his refusal, she pulled out a stack of money and slammed it into his face.  
Lawrence was hit so hard his face turned sideways, and blood immediately seeped from his cheek.  
He knew she was making such a demand solely to take revenge on him.  
And she did indeed succeed.  
That night, as he stood outside the door, he heard the intimate sounds of her and Jason.
