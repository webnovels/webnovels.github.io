Five months pregnant, my husband, David Miller, secured approval for family relocation on base, yet he had no intention of bringing me.

"Audrey, Leah's husband died saving my life. I owe them everything."

"Just wait a little longer. In six months, I promise I'll come for you and Mom."

I waited year after year.

At first, my husband would still send letters, but then, complete radio silence.

The local scoundrel, seeing my family's vulnerability, came to force me into becoming his woman.

To protect me, my mother-in-law, Martha, was beaten to death with a wooden club. My daughter was thrown into a well and drowned.

David finally came back, only to curse me, calling me a loose woman who had caused our whole family's demise.

He forced me to sign divorce papers, then turned around and held a city-wide sensational wedding with his 'benefactor's' widow.

While they feasted in their sprawling mansion, I was left to starve to death.

When I opened my eyes again, I was back—the day before that scoundrel showed up.

This time, I vow to lead Martha and Daisy to the life that should have been ours!
