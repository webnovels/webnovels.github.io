Five years ago, the Chen and Brooks families decided to arrange a marriage between their children through a random draw. Lucas Chen, who had always been fond of my younger sister, ended up being matched with me.

After standing me up 99 times at the courthouse, he resolutely chose to go on a business trip to Kenya, a country with harsh living conditions. He left for five years.

The day after he left, my sister Rachel abandoned her arranged fiancé and emigrated to Kenya as well.

Five years later, Lucas returned to the country with Rachel and their daughter Lily. He arrogantly informed me:

"Since we have to follow the arranged marriage rules, I will only marry Rachel."

"As long as you stay at home and take good care of her and Lily, I won't embarrass you in front of others."

The man who was originally waiting for my response looked down at my daughter Emma, whom I was holding hands with, and suddenly smiled:

"So you got pregnant after just one time? Looks like you have no choice but to agree now."

I covered Emma's mouth as she was about to call him "Daddy" and whispered to her:

"How about I find you a new daddy? Is that okay?"
