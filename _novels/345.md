After the bankruptcy, I was drugged and practically thrown into my childhood friend Liam’s bed.

From that day on, he brought someone new home every night, then tossed a divorce agreement at me.

“Ellie, beg me, and I won’t go through with it.”

He’d look down on me, watching me grovel in the dirt again and again, just to get him to change his mind.

He even openly ordered me to massage his new assistant, Chloe’s, feet right there in his office.

Until the day Sterling Corp needed just ten million dollars to completely turn things around, Chloe blocked all my desperate calls for help.

I waited a grueling twenty-four hours, until Sterling Corp utterly collapsed, and my parents, driven to despair, jumped from a building.

Liam, however, walked in with Chloe, practically throwing the signed divorce papers at me again.

“Ellie, weren’t you just looking for me to get money to save your family? Beg me. As long as I don’t divorce you, no one would dare touch Sterling Corp.”

This time, I signed my name with a quiet, devastating calm: “Mr. Hayes, it’s not necessary. Sterling Corp doesn't need your help anymore.”
