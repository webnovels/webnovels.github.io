After putting Daisy to sleep, I had just returned to my room when Mr. Harrison called again.

"My apologies, Ms. Sterling. Ms. Thorne is new and perhaps a bit out of line. I’ve reprimanded her severely. I'm currently away on a business trip, but when I return, I’ll personally bring Ms. Thorne to apologize."

Mr. Harrison’s tone was sincere, and I didn't want to make things difficult for them over this.

So, I softened my voice and declined. "It's fine, as long as this doesn’t happen again."

"Understood. We'll still need your continued guidance and supervision in the future, Ms. Sterling."

After a few more polite exchanges, I hung up.

But lying in bed, I tossed and turned, unable to sleep.

My company's new project was in its critical final stages, and my husband had also been away on business.

We had indeed neglected Daisy’s development.

I hadn’t even met the new teacher in person.

After much thought, I decided to personally pick Daisy up from school tomorrow so I could talk to Ms. Thorne face-to-face.
