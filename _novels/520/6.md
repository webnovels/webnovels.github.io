Daisy tugged at my sleeve. "Mommy, aren't we going home yet?"

I snapped back to reality, took her hand, and left the school. "Daisy, would you like to switch kindergartens?"

She hesitated for a moment, then nodded. "But I still want to go to the weekend parent-child activity with you, Mommy."

"Okay."

I stroked her head, deciding to accompany her to this one activity, then proceed with the transfer.

And as for the investment in Aurora, I also decided to withdraw it.

An educational group that doesn't prioritize character in its teachers, only background, isn't worth my money.

As soon as we got home, I saw a large bouquet of roses on the table.

Just as I picked them up, someone wrapped their arms around my waist from behind, whispering in my ear, "Honey, I missed you so much."

"Daddy!" Daisy cried out excitedly.

My husband released me, picked her up, and gave her a big kiss on the cheek. "My precious girl, did you miss Daddy?"

"Yes, I missed you every single day."

Daisy wrapped her arms around his neck. "Daddy, will you come to the school activity with me?"

I playfully scolded her, "Just now you said you wanted to go with Mommy. Are you already breaking your promise?"

Daisy made a funny face. "Mommy can come too!"

My husband pulled me into his embrace. "That's right, it's been a while since the three of us were together. It's perfect timing, my work is done, so I can spend some quality time with you both."

I nodded. "My project is almost finished too. Let's go on a trip abroad soon."

"Yay!" Daisy clapped her hands excitedly.
