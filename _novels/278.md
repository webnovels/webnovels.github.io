Everyone knew I was the one Grandpa Hayes had personally chosen for a marriage alliance. Whoever married me was destined to inherit the Hayes family empire.

At the engagement party, I stood in my custom-tailored suit, ready to announce the merger of the Hayes and Davies families.

But my fiancée, Chloe Hayes, was holding hands with my adopted brother, Blake Miller. She pulled him to the center of the crowd, standing shoulder to shoulder with him.

“Blake and I are madly in love. He’s the only man I’ll ever marry.”

“Asher Thorne is far too reckless. He’s not fit to lead the Hayes company.”

The engagement changed hands; my adopted brother was now the one betrothed to Chloe. Everyone in the room looked at me with pity or scorn.

But what they didn't know was that Grandpa Hayes had picked me to marry Chloe because my mother was the heir to the powerful, discreet Thorne family. One day, I would return to the Thorne family and inherit their legacy.

Since Chloe had made her choice, it was time for the Hayes family heir to change as well.
