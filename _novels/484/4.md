The mascot head was ripped off, sweat-soaked hair clinging to my forehead. My eyes, fixed on Seraphina, were as still as dead water. 

“Believe that you, the esteemed heiress of the Vance family, pretended to be poor and scammed me for five years to test my true love?”

Seeing that it was me beneath the mascot head, Seraphina froze, her pupils shrinking instantly. 

And at that moment, I finally got a clear look at her, sitting on the sofa, clad in exquisite high-end designer clothes. 

She was a completely different person from the messy state she was in half an hour ago at home.

The bullet comments exploded.

“OMG, OMG! The male lead actually confronted the female lead! How awkward!”

“No, how can this male lead be so unforgiving! The female lead lied to protect his dignity; it wasn’t what she wanted to do! Can’t the male lead be a little more understanding?”

“Ahhh, this is a bloodbath! I love watching the male and female leads fight and love each other.”

The moment she saw me, Seraphina stood stunned, her lips trembling. But the next words out of her mouth were still an excuse.

 “What pretending to be poor? Honey, I’m at work! Let’s talk about this at home…”

Her aura of nobility vanished as she quickly bowed and scraped, apologizing to Julian and the other rich playboys around her.

 “Bosses, my apologies, I just have a little family matter to deal with.”

Her performance left the rich kids looking at each other in confusion. 

And I was so disgusted I almost wanted to vomit. We were clearly at the point of no return, yet she still wanted to fake poverty? Was it ever going to end?

Saying this, Seraphina tried to pull me out, but I violently shook her off and roared, “Seraphina, you’re still going to pretend to be poor? Do you think I’m stupid? The Ferrari, the high-end club, everything you and Julian said—I heard it all!”

“Stop torturing me, okay? Let’s just break up!”

My eyes were bloodshot as tears streamed down my face. I thought with everything out in the open, Seraphina would finally confess.

 Explain, apologize, or at least show some regret. But instead, the woman broke into hysterical sobs: “Liam! Don’t break up! I… I’m actually Julian’s escort girl!”
