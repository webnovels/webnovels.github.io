Before she died, she said, “Mom won’t be a burden to you anymore. Leave the money for Sera to pay her debts.”

In her last moments, she was still thinking of Seraphina. But what about Seraphina? Now, my mom was dead, and she was returning the money, saying it was for Mom’s treatment…

My eyes welled with tears, Seraphina’s words echoed in my ears, shattering and reassembling. 

All I heard was impatient anger: “Julian checked, and he said your mom was fine. I already returned the money. Are you still going to be mad at me?”

Seeing I wouldn't take it, she slammed the bank card at my feet: “Liam, are you disgusted with me? I only asked for a measly two hundred grand, and this is how you truly are? I even told Julian you weren’t a gold-digger! Liam, is this what you meant by ‘I’ll support you’?!”

A measly two hundred grand?

Turns out… she didn’t even care about $200,000. Suddenly, I didn’t want to argue with her anymore.

Thinking I was still holding a grudge, Seraphina angrily kicked over a nearby stool. “I was going to visit your mom at the hospital, but with that attitude, I’m not going!”

The door slammed shut with a bang, and her furious footsteps faded into the distance.

The comments were fuming, frustrated beyond belief:

“The male lead’s lost his mind! He lasted five years, what’s wrong with him now? Trust me, the female lead’s definitely gone to Julian to complain.”

“If the male lead didn’t lack a powerful family background, would the female lead have to test him like this? My poor female lead, a broken, crying mess after being scorned by her husband again, right?”

“This pisses me off! The male supporting character will definitely take advantage of this to stir up trouble! Male lead, hurry up and go comfort her!”

After seeing the comments, I did follow Seraphina downstairs. But not to comfort her. It was to verify if her “elite family”

 background was real. I simply couldn’t believe that my messy, home-bound, cancer-stricken wife could one day be a high-society heiress, someone utterly unreachable for a commoner like me. I wanted to see it with my own eyes…

I followed Seraphina through the village food street, past the garbage heaps swarming with flies… 

Then I watched her walk straight towards the luxury car parked at the street corner. 

It was that red Ferrari, the one I always noticed whenever I drove her to the hospital, just outside the rundown neighborhood… 

A quick search on my phone showed it was worth 8.88 million.

Back then, I’d found it odd and even joked with Seraphina that there must be a big shot in this rundown neighborhood if someone could afford a sports car.

 Little did I know, the owner was right beside me. 

So many things suddenly made sense, and a bitter taste filled my mouth.

 But I couldn't dwell on it. The sports car roared past, and I instinctively flagged down a taxi to follow.

The car stopped in front of an exclusive club. I looked up and saw the familiar sign for ‘The Sovereign Club’.

Seraphina had come to the very club where I had worked part-time for years. 

Watching her casually take the elevator directly to the top-floor private suite, it hit me: the top-floor VIP client the manager always talked about—the one who dropped a fortune in one night and had to be treated like royalty—was Seraphina all along…

So, the floors I meticulously scrubbed clean on my hands and knees every night were to prepare for my own wife’s arrival. I clenched my fists, my heart growing colder by the inch.

Just as I was about to burst into the suite and demand a divorce from Seraphina, the manager’s surprised voice came from behind me. “Liam? Oh, perfect timing! Quick! We need a hand!”

Before I could refuse, I was shoved into a mascot costume and sent into the suite, where guests were already impatiently demanding a dance.

 The music inside was deafening, and a group of people were having a wild time. It was stifling hot inside the costume, my vision limited.

 I couldn’t see who was who, only awkwardly swayed my limbs to the music. I wanted to finish and leave quickly, but then a foot suddenly kicked me.

A familiar voice exploded. It was Seraphina, furious: “What the hell, can’t you dance? You stepped on my foot!”
