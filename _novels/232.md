"My best friend, Bethany, she was like, a total man-magnet. Seriously, she could bat her eyelashes and steal any guy's heart. And she did. Eight times, to be exact. Eight times she swiped my boyfriend right out from under me.

This time, she set her sights on Ethan Blackwood, the CEO. And, of course, she snagged him.

Finally, while she was busy trying to conquer Ethan, I thought I could actually have a normal relationship with my boyfriend, Chris.

We were even planning our wedding!

But guess what? She did it again! Bethany stole Chris right before we were about to walk down the aisle.

And Ethan caught her.

Or, more accurately, Ethan and I caught them together.

We stood outside the door, listening to our significant others going at it like rabbits.

Ethan looked like he was about to explode. The great Ethan Blackwood, CEO extraordinaire, was officially wearing the cuckold crown.

I turned to him and said, ""What do you say, Ethan? Want to get even? Maybe… with me?"""
