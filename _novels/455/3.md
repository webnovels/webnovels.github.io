As we left the police station, Mom's phone rang.

My grandmother's anxious voice came through the speaker:

"Olivia, Abby is missing."

The moment I heard Grandma's voice, my heart clenched.

If she found out about my death, that kind old lady would be heartbroken.

Ever since Mom kicked me out of the house, Grandma had taken me in.

Grandma and Mom's relationship wasn't good to begin with.

After taking me in, they completely cut off contact.

Mom snorted disdainfully:

"She's pulling this childish stunt again. Does she think she's still three years old?"

Grandma said worriedly:

"But I haven't been able to reach her for three days..."

Before Grandma could finish, Mom angrily scolded her.

"I've told you before, don't talk to me about that troublemaker anymore."

Mom hung up the phone and blocked Grandma's number.

After returning home from the police station, Mom immediately went to Emma's room.

"Emma, Mom's home," she called out in a gentle, affectionate voice.

The kind of loving voice all doting mothers use.

I once had that kind of love too, but now it no longer belonged to me.

She was only Emma's mom now.

Emma got up and threw herself into Mom's arms, acting coy.

"Mom, you work too hard. I've missed you so much these past few days."

Mom stroked her head lovingly:

"Don't worry, once Mom finishes the case I'm working on, I'll take some vacation days and bring you to see the capital."

The capital!

The place I had always dreamed of visiting to see the flag-raising ceremony.

Now, all those wonderful things were given to Emma instead.

Emma nodded with a smile, then casually asked:

"Is this dismemberment case Mom's working on very troublesome? Will they catch the killer?"

With her professional instincts, Mom immediately picked up on the key point.

"Emma, how do you know it's a dismemberment case?"

My heart leapt.

If they pursued this lead from Emma, they might be able to find the killer quickly.

Emma paused for a second, but reacted quickly, snuggling into Mom's arms.

"That day when you called me, I was worried something had happened to you. I know the rules at the station so I didn't dare ask directly. I just searched online myself and heard about the dismemberment case."

Although Detective Johnson had quickly suppressed the news, we're in an era of rapid information spread. There were still plenty of rumors circulating.

Mom's brow immediately relaxed. She hugged Emma tightly.

"Don't worry, nothing will happen to Mom."

I shrank dejectedly into the corner.

This lead had been cut off too!
