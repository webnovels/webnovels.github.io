After two sleepless days and nights of hard work, I finally managed to separate the human tissue from the animal tissue.

The results shocked everyone.

Detective Johnson looked at me in disbelief:

"You're saying only a quarter of this is human?"

I nodded coldly: "That's right."

Everyone's faces were grim.

They had originally thought only the head was missing, but now it turned out so much of the body was gone too.

If human tissue had made its way onto citizens' dinner tables, it would cause huge waves of panic across the city.

The higher-ups were taking this very seriously. The situation was becoming more and more difficult to handle.

Detective Johnson's gaze swept over the display rack nearby, landing on one of the tissue samples.

He took down the sample and handed it to me:

"What's this?"

My soul began to get excited.

They were finally going to discover it was me.

I believed that as soon as Mom realized the victim was me, she would surely be able to find the real killer.

I had a serious expression: "I was just about to tell you about this. It's currently our only lead."

"There's a scar on the victim's ankle. DNA comparison will take time, but this clue can effectively shorten the comparison process."

Detective Johnson's brow furrowed slightly: "Doesn't Abby have a scar on her ankle too? I remember..."

Detective Johnson wasn't just my parents' old partner, he had also been our neighbor for over 20 years.

The scar on my ankle was from when I was riding on the back of his bicycle and got caught in the wheel.

He still remembered that incident!

Before Detective Johnson could finish speaking, Mom angrily interrupted him.

"Johnson, stop it. I know you're trying to improve my relationship with Abby and get me to show more concern for her. But whenever I think of her, I'm reminded of my husband's death. I can never forgive Abby."

"She's the one who caused my husband's death."

My heart was suddenly pierced with pain, my soul trembling.

After all these years, Mom still couldn't forgive me.

I was the one who caused Dad's death.

I deserved to die!

Years ago, my aunt and uncle died in an accident, leaving my cousin Emma an orphan.

Dad felt sorry for Emma having no one to rely on, so he took her in to raise.

But Emma and I didn't get along well, and we often argued over trivial things.

Three years ago on a rainy night, Emma and I had a huge fight and she angrily ran out of the house.

Dad drove out to look for Emma.

He got into an accident on the way and died at the scene.

Mom cursed me as a murderer, saying I had caused Dad's death.

She kicked me out of the house and stopped taking care of me.

Mom said Emma was the only blood relative left in the Su family, and she treated Emma like her own daughter.

Now, I had been killed in the most cruel way.

I, the "murderer", had received the harshest punishment!

Could Mom forgive me now?
