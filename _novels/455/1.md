In the trash bin behind the butcher counter at the grocery store, there was a pile of yellowish fatty tissue that turned out to be human remains.

Detective Johnson rushed to the scene as soon as he received the report.

I felt relieved when I saw my old partner arrive.

"Johnson, this is a serious situation," I said.

Detective Johnson nodded with a frown.

Finding dismembered body parts at a grocery store butcher counter - any part of that phrase was enough to send the whole city into a panic.

To avoid causing public alarm, Detective Johnson sealed off all the meat counters in the entire store.

He asked me, "How long will it take you to examine all these samples?"

I had a grave expression. As a dedicated and responsible forensic pathologist, I replied, "At least two days."

I secretly breathed a sigh of relief. With my mother's skills, she would surely be able to help catch the real culprit quickly.

Detective Johnson's brow relaxed a bit.

"Make arrangements at home. You should stay at the station for the next few days."

I nodded and pulled out my phone.

The moment the call connected, the normally serious and professional female pathologist became gentle and affectionate.

"Emma, sweetie, Mom has to work overtime for the next few days. Be good and stay at home. Don't go out. If anything happens, contact Mr. Wilson next door, okay?"

After giving detailed instructions, I hung up the phone feeling reassured.

As I turned to get in the car, Detective Johnson called out to stop me.

"Shouldn't you call Abby too? Tell her to be extra careful."

My face instantly darkened:

"It would be better if she died out there. I never want to see her again."

I smiled bitterly to myself.

Who knew that even souls could feel pain!

Mom said she never wanted to see me again, but I was already right in front of her.

Many of the samples she was intently focused on examining came from my own body.

She just hadn't recognized me yet.
