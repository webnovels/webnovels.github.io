Mabel Myers had cared for Wesley Valentine, who was paralyzed in both legs, with unwavering devotion for three whole years.

In their first year of marriage, Wesley despised her. Once, he locked her out of their room for 99 days after she accidentally brushed against his legs.

In their second year, he remained indifferent. Mabel massaged his legs every day and helped him through rehabilitation, yet he never uttered a single word of acknowledgment.

By their third year, Wesley's legs finally recovered. But now, the first thing he wanted to do was pick up his first love from the airport.

…

"Annie, my legs are healed. Come back, and I'll meet you at the airport myself!"

Seeing the familiar name on his phone, Mabel's tears of joy froze on her face. She had always known Wesley didn't love her. The only woman he ever loved was his first love—Anais Boyer.

Three years ago, Wesley and Anais graduated from university together. He was set to inherit his family's business, while she pursued her dreams abroad. They went their separate ways, but Wesley never truly let go of her.

Then, Anais suddenly married someone overseas. Devastated, Wesley sped toward the airport in a reckless attempt to stop the wedding. But on the way, he got into a car crash that left him paralyzed.

At the time, Mabel was a medical intern who assisted the director in Wesley's surgery. After the operation, Wesley—once a proud and brilliant man—couldn't accept his new reality. He grew volatile, lashing out at the slightest provocation.

Too intimidated to deal with him, the hospital staff pushed Mabel forward to take charge as she was the one with the least amount of experience. With her gentle demeanor, natural warmth, and meticulous professionalism, she became the only person in the hospital who could approach Wesley.

Later, after Wesley's discharge, his mother, Pearl Solis, came to Mabel with an offer. She was willing to pay her five million dollars to marry Wesley and care for him full-time.

Mabel, who was struggling with her mother's expensive medical treatments at the time, agreed without hesitation.

She quit her job at the hospital and spent three years by Wesley's side. When his injured legs made him furious and bitter, Mabel endured his temper without complaint.

When his wounds ached, she stayed up all night massaging them. She even threw herself beneath him to cushion his fall every time he fell during rehabilitation.

Everyone wondered why this young woman was so devoted to Wesley. But only Mabel knew the truth—her entire college tuition had been covered by his generosity.

Wesley had been the head of the university's charity foundation, and she was just one of many students he had supported.

The distance between them had always been vast, and Mabel had never dared to hope for more. Yet, by a twist of fate, she ended up meeting Wesley again after his accident. She chose to stay, willing to give him everything she had.

For years, Mabel believed that if she persisted, Wesley might one day see her worth. But now, watching him immediately share his news of recovery with Anais, she suddenly felt exhausted.

Even after three years of marriage, it seemed she had never truly reached his heart.

Every year on Valentine's Day, Wesley would vanish without a word. He wouldn't return no matter how frantically Mabel searched for him.

She later learned it was the anniversary of Wesley and Anais' relationship. Even separated, he remembered every date tied to her and meticulously prepared gifts.

There was also his study that was always locked. Once, Mabel accidentally entered while cleaning—only to be thrown out and left standing in the rain all night. As it turned out, the room was filled with Anais' photos.

That was the moment Mabel understood. Wesley would never truly open his heart to her. But at least now, with his legs healed, her duty was finally over.

While Wesley was still on the phone with Anais, Mabel slipped away and made a call of her own.

"Mom, Wesley can walk again. My job is done. I'm going to divorce him now."
