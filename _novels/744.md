Zaria Slate felt her eyelids grow heavier after drinking the milk Callum Fenwick gave to her. Her consciousness faded.

She had no idea how much time had passed, but she sensed that she was being brought to a place she didn't recognize. Then, she vaguely heard a familiar voice.

"Have you lost your mind, Callum? Are you really going to keep Zaria in the dark as you remove her kidney to be transplanted into Cyrene's body?"

The voice belonged to Jovan Zyne, Callum's childhood friend.

"She's the only one who's a match." Callum's voice was eerily calm.

"Cy's life is at risk. She can't wait any longer. As for Zaria, I'll make it up to her. Since she wants to marry me, I'll propose to her after the surgery. I'll guarantee we'll never divorce."

Something made of glass suddenly landed on the floor, and Jovan shouted, "No compensation is enough for her kidney! I really don't understand. What kind of spell has Cyrene cast on you? During the earthquake back then, you even sacrificed your legs to save her.

"And you lost your inheritance rights for her, only for her to turn around and run off with another man! During those days, Zaria was the one who stayed with you and took care of you! In order to give you injections, she tested them on herself first. Her legs were all bruised up!

"To see a doctor, she waited outside a famous clinic for a whole month! Now that Cyrene has returned, she wants you back because she saw that you're on the rise again. After learning that Zaria was pregnant with your child, she cried and made a scene.

"You secretly gave Zaria abortion pills and made her lose your first child. Zaria still blames herself for not protecting the baby well enough. She was depressed for three whole months! And now, you're going to give Cyrene her kidney?"

"Enough!" Callum roared suddenly.

"I know Zaria loves me enough to give up everything. And Cyrene is selfish, materialistic, and vain. But I just love Cyrene! I love her madly!"

"And what about Zaria?"

"She means nothing! My mind is made up. No one can convince me. I must take her kidney!"

The moment these words rang out, Zaria felt the surgical knife cut into her skin.

The anesthesiologist had clearly underestimated her resistance to the drugs, as she could feel every bit of pain sharply.

However, the pain in her heart was stronger than the physical pain. She felt as though her heart was slowly being ripped apart.

She had loved Callum for ten years.

From the age of 16 to 26, she gave her youth, her love, and her everything to him.

She watched him love Cyrene and go crazy for her. And she was also there when Callum collapsed after Cyrene abandoned him.

Zaria stood by him through the darkest days after he became disabled. She endured his irritability and depression. When he lost control, he would shove her to the ground, bruising her knees. But she never complained.

She just picked herself up silently and continued to care for him.

She thought that one day, he would return her feelings.

But it turned out that in his eyes, she actually meant nothing.

Ten years.

Even after everything they went through together, he still only loved Cyrene.

Because of what Cyrene said, Callum made Zaria lose their first child.

Cyrene needed a kidney, so Callum secretly took Zaria's kidney to give it to her.

Zaria didn't know how much time had passed, but she felt something being forcibly torn away from her body—it was her kidney and the love she had given him for ten years.

When she woke up, the room smelled so strongly of disinfectant that it made her eyes sting.

"You're awake." A deep male voice came from the door.

Zaria tensed as she raised her gaze slowly.

Callum stood in the doorway. His figure was backlit, and his tall figure cast a harsh silhouette.

He stepped closer. His pants clung to his straight legs. Each step he took seemed to crush her heart.

Sitting by her bed, Callum reached out to stroke her face. He brushed away the tears at the corner of her eyes. He furrowed his brows slightly. "Does it hurt?"

Zaria looked at him, feeling suffocated. It was as though an invisible hand was gripping her heart.

How could he ask her that question in such a gentle tone?

After he cut out her kidney with his own hands, how could he sit there as if nothing had happened? How could he still look at her with such concern when he was the reason they lost their child?

"What… happened to me?" she asked. Her voice was so hoarse that it didn't even sound like her.

"You had a sudden appendicitis attack. The surgery is done." Callum's expression remained unchanged, though he still sounded gentle. 

Appendicitis?

Zaria laughed, and tears rolled down her face relentlessly.

He couldn't even be bothered to make up a decent lie.

She cried hard, and Callum kept wiping away her tears. But he didn't notice anything strange. He just thought she was in pain and quickly said he'd go find a doctor before rushing out.

But once he left, he never came back.

Three hours later, a nurse came in to change her dressing.

"Mr. Fenwick truly treats Ms. Yorke well. He stayed by her side all night long. And when she said she wanted the food from the old shop in the west end, he immediately drove there himself to get it. He drove through the heavy rain."

Hearing this, Zaria couldn't hold back anymore as tears spilled from her eyes again.

So, that was why he never came back.

He was so sure she loved him and wouldn't be angry at him that he didn't even bother to send a single text to explain his absence.

"Callum, am I really that pathetic in your eyes? What makes you think there's no limit to my love for you?" she thought.

Zaria looked out the window. Her tears had already dried.

The nurse left. Zaria didn't know how much time had passed before she finally reached for her phone. She paused for a second before dialing a number.

The call connected, and a deep, lazy male voice came through. "Hello, Ms. Slate."

Zaria took a deep breath before asking, "Franklin, would you be interested... in marrying me?"

There was a brief silence on the other end. "Did you call the wrong number? I'm not Callum."

"I know." Zaria gripped the phone tightly. Her fingertips were turning white.

"I'm asking you. I don't want to marry Callum anymore."

Franklin Joseph sounded intrigued now. His tone was slow and easy. "Oh? But what makes you think I'll marry you?"

Zaria closed her eyes as she replied calmly, "You're Callum's biggest rival. And you have a photo of me on your desk."

There was a deathly silence.

After a while, the faint click of a lighter came through the phone. Franklin took a drag of his cigarette. "How did you know?"

Zaria stared at the ceiling of the ward. The fluid in the IV drip fell, drop by drop, like a countdown to the end of her hopeless devotion.

"You only need to answer my question."

Another second of silence ensued.

Then, finally, the man spoke. His tone didn't give away anything, and his breathing was noticeably uneven. "Come to me within seven days. We'll get married. And…"

He paused for a moment before continuing, "Once you marry me, you must never be involved with Callum again."

Zaria closed her eyes as she replied softly but firmly, "I won't. After seven more days, I won't see him ever again."

After hanging up, she immediately booked a flight to Solenthia. She would fly there in seven days.

Solenthia was Franklin's territory.

…

Callum didn't show up for the rest of the day.

A nurse came in and informed, "Ms. Slate, Mr. Fenwick's swamped with work. He asked us to take care of you."

Zaria replied with a hum, though she knew that was a lie.

She knew Callum wasn't busy—he was probably with Cyrene and refusing to leave her side for a second.

It wasn't until the day she was discharged that Callum finally appeared.

He was in a sharp suit. Though he looked weary, he was still handsome enough to take one's breath away.

Seeing Zaria packed and standing at the door, he walked over quickly, reaching out to take her bag.

"Sorry, Ria. The company's been extremely busy lately. And… I've been preparing a surprise. That's why I haven't been here."

Zaria avoided his hand. She carried the bag herself as she walked ahead. "What surprise?"

Callum smiled slightly, and there was an unusual softness in his eyes. "I'll bring you somewhere."

Half an hour later, the car stopped in front of a luxury hotel.

Zaria followed Callum inside. The moment the banquet hall doors opened, a sea of roses and candlelight greeted her eyes.

It was a proposal.

All the guests turned to look at her, and their eyes were focused.

Callum held her hand and led her to the center before getting on one knee and pulling out a diamond ring from his pocket.

Looking up at her, he asked earnestly, "Ria, will you marry me?"

Zaria stared at him blankly. Her heart clenched.

She had once longed for this moment so much.

But now, as she looked at the dazzling diamond ring, all she felt was bitter irony.

The proposal she had waited so long for was exchanged for her kidney.

She was about to refuse when someone suddenly pushed the banquet hall doors open.

"Sorry, I'm late." A soft and frail voice came through.

Zaria turned and saw Cyrene in a white dress. She was standing in the doorway. She looked pale, and tears were shimmering in her eyes.

Cyrene walked over. Her voice was choked with emotion. "Callum, Zaria, what happened back then was my fault. I shouldn't have stuck by Callum's side. I've been disturbing your relationship. When I found out about the proposal, I came to give my blessing."

As she spoke, she took out two delicate gift boxes from her bag and handed them to Callum and Zaria.

"I wish you… happiness."

After that, she turned to leave. She had only taken two steps when she suddenly swayed and "fainted" on the spot.

"Cy!"

Callum's expression changed drastically. He sprang up and rushed over without hesitation, scooping Cyrene into his arms.

He completely forgot that he had just been kneeling in front of Zaria while clutching the diamond ring.

The guests instantly started whispering among themselves.

"Tsk, tsk. It's the same every time. The moment Mr. Fenwick sees Cyrene, he can't see anyone else."

"Zaria's been with him all these years, but he doesn't even bother to spare her a glance."

"He has always loved Cyrene."

Zaria stood there. Her fingertips dug deep into her palm.

She watched as Callum carried Cyrene away in a hurry as Cyrene mouthed to Zaria, "You'll never beat me."

What pathetic acting.

But Callum didn't even question it. He just believed it.

At night, Callum didn't come home.

Zaria sat in the bedroom, gathering everything related to Callum—photos, gifts, even the buttons he casually tossed aside, but she had treasured—into a box.

She continued tossing stuff inside the box until she saw a soft pink baby onesie.

As she gripped the soft fabric, her eyes reddened.

Back when she was pregnant, she had looked forward to the baby's arrival. She had hoped they would get married and stay together for life.

However, she found out that Callum had gotten rid of their three-month-old baby.

Zaria suppressed the sharp pain in her heart as she carried the box and threw it into the trash.

The things were gone, and so was all the love she had for Callum.

The next day, Zaria went straight to resign from Fenwick Group.

Back then, Callum had lost the right to inherit the company due to his disabled legs. His illegitimate brother had taken his place.

Later, when Callum recovered, the first thing he did was sign a bet-on agreement. He would have to double the company's performance within three years to take back everything.

To help him, Zaria worked as his secretary. She accompanied him to social events, drank until she had gastric bleeding, and stayed up so late she fainted.

She did it all out of love.

But in the end, she got nothing in return.

Luckily, from now on, she would never be that foolish again.

The moment news of her resignation broke out, the company was in an uproar. Almost everyone tried to persuade her to stay.

"Zaria, are you really quitting? Can't you stay?"

"Yeah, the company's doing just fine. Why did you suddenly resign?"

"You brought all of us up by hand. What will we do without you? Also, Mr. Fenwick definitely can't do without you!"

Little did they know, Callum was doing just fine without Zaria.

Zaria's lips curled up slightly in a self-deprecating expression.

"I'm really resigning. These years have been too exhausting. I want to take a good break."

"No one is truly dependent on someone else to survive. All of you will be fine. He… will be fine, too."

After saying goodbye to everyone, Zaria left the company with her personal belongings.

When she got home, Callum called.

"You resigned?" he asked in shock, which was rare.

"Yeah, I'm getting married. There's too much to do. I can't keep working," Zaria answered calmly.

Callum didn't think much of it. He assumed she had agreed to the previous proposal and was busy preparing for the wedding.

His tone softened. "Sorry, I have to go on a business trip for a project. I won't be able to help with the wedding planning."

Before Zaria could respond, Cyrene's voice suddenly came through the phone. "Callum, feed me."

Callum's voice instantly grew distant. "Hey, I'm on the phone."

Cyrene pouted. "Feed me, or I'll find another man—"

The call was abruptly cut off.

Zaria's heart ached. Her hands trembled as she opened her Instagram.

Sure enough, Cyrene had posted a photo of Callum feeding her some fruit, along with the provocative caption, "It feels so good to be spoiled."

Zaria shut her eyes and turned off her phone.

…

In the middle of the night, Zaria's ringtone jolted her awake.

Jovan's panicked voice came through the receiver. "Zaria! Callum was stabbed over a dozen times while trying to save Cyrene. 

"He's losing too much blood, and the blood bank is short on type B blood. Both you and Cyrene match his blood type, but she said she can't donate because she just had a kidney transplant. Can you come save him?"

At his words, Zaria only felt a buzzing in her ears.

A wave of bitterness surged in her chest.

She had also lost a kidney, after all.

Hearing her silence, Jovan grew more anxious. "Zaria, I'm begging you. If you refuse, he'll die. Cyrene is unreliable. You're the only one who can save him!"

Jovan pleaded again and again.

Zaria stayed silent. Her thoughts were a chaotic mess.

After a long time, she decided she couldn't let Callum die.

Putting on her coat, she rushed to the hospital.

At the hospital, Zaria lay on the bed in the blood collection room. There, she watched the dark red blood slowly flow from her body.

She was already weak. By the end of the draw, her vision turned black, and she fainted.

When she woke up, it was already noon the next day.

She propped herself up, wanting to check out and see how Callum was doing.

But just as she reached the door to his ward, she heard the conversation inside between Callum and Jovan.

"Callum, you got seriously hurt because of Cyrene, yet she ran off again. You would've died had Zaria not donated her blood to you. I'm begging you. Can't you just see Cyrene for who she really is and treat Zaria properly?"

Callum was silent for a moment before he replied in a low voice, "Cy just had a kidney transplant. She's not in good health. It makes sense that she didn't donate her blood."

At that, Jovan almost choked. "Cyrene's not in good health? What about Zaria? Look at what she's done for you these past years—she's ruined herself! Aren't you afraid she'll leave you for good if you keep treating her this way?"

"She won't," Callum stated firmly.

"Zaria loves me, just like I love Cyrene. She would never leave me."

Zaria stood outside the room, listening to that firm declaration from Callum.

She felt as though her heart had been crushed. The pain was nearly suffocating.

So, this was what it was like to be loved wholeheartedly. Callum never feared that Zaria would leave him.

But he was wrong. Zaria didn't love him anymore.

She would leave him and never come back.

"I can't stay here any longer." She turned to leave, but then heard Callum's phone suddenly ring inside the ward.

His voice immediately softened. "Cy? What's wrong?"

On the other end, Cyrene's tearful voice came through. It was too muffled, so Zaria could not make out the words. But Callum's expression changed instantly.

He abruptly threw off the blanket and yanked out the IV needle from the back of his hand. Blood seeped out at once, but he seemed to feel no pain. He grabbed his coat and headed straight for the door.

"Callum!" Jovan grabbed him, furious. 

"What are you doing? You're still injured. The doctor said you can't be discharged yet!"

Callum shook him off while saying coldly, "Cy's afraid of thunder. I have to be with her."

Jovan's face turned dark with rage. "You're willing to die for her? What about Zaria? She just gave you blood. Have you even thought to ask about her?"

Callum paused for a moment but didn't look back.

He didn't even take his coat as he pushed the door open and walked out. He did not notice that Zaria was standing right outside.

As Zaria watched his figure disappear in a hurry, she stayed silent for a long while and finally let out a soft laugh.

She should've been used to this by now.

Whenever Cyrene cried, Callum's world fell apart.

But no matter how much blood Zaria shed for him, he wouldn't spare her a glance.

Two days later, Callum came back.

When he opened the door, Zaria was sitting on the couch. She was organizing flight tickets and documents.

"Ria." He walked up to her. His tone was uncharacteristically gentle.

"I heard you donated blood to me. Why would you be so silly?"

Zaria calmly tucked away her documents without even raising her head. "I just want you to be okay."

Callum didn't notice her indifference. He sat down beside her and held her hand.

"Cyrene interrupted the proposal last time. I've arranged another party to make it up to you."

Zaria finally looked up at him. Only then did she notice that he looked pretty pale due to blood loss and his refusal to stay at the hospital.

"Forget it. What if Cyrene faints again?" she asked softly.

Callum frowned and replied with certainty, "She won't. I didn't invite her."

Zaria smiled; Callum didn't catch the sarcasm in it.

But she said nothing more. She just nodded.

…

On the way to the party, Callum drove while Zaria sat in the passenger seat. She watched the scenery blur past outside the window.

Suddenly, Callum's phone rang.

As soon as he answered, Cyrene's shrill, sobbing voice screamed through the receiver. "Callum, I've been abducted! They said they're going to kill me!"

Callum's face instantly turned pale.

Slamming on the brakes, he quickly opened a tracking app, and a blinking red dot appeared on the screen.

"Hold on!" he shouted.

Then, he yanked the wheel hard, and the car made a sharp U-turn, racing toward the outskirts.

The violent swerve slammed Zaria into the car door. Her forehead smashed against the window, and blood started trickling down.

But Callum didn't even notice. His mind was entirely on Cyrene's safety.

The car swerved recklessly through traffic on the highway, finally screeching to a stop on an abandoned bridge.

It was pouring. Zaria couldn't even see clearly. She could only vaguely make out a man holding Cyrene at knifepoint at the edge of the bridge.

"Callum! You finally came!" the man hollered hysterically.

"You ruined my company and drove my wife to jump off a building! Now, I'm going to kill the person you love most!"

Callum got out of the car. Rain soaked his suit, but he didn't feel the cold. Step by step, he walked closer.

"You've got it wrong. She's not the one I love most," he responded icily.

The man froze. The knife slipped slightly away from Cyrene's neck. "What?"

Callum's tone remained cold. "Didn't you do any research? You abducted my ex. Years ago, when I was crippled, she abandoned me. I hated her."

He let out a cold laugh. "The one I love now is the person who stayed by my side these past few years."

As he spoke, he turned and looked at Zaria in the car. His gaze was intense and deep. One could drown in it.

Zaria froze.

This was the first time Callum had ever looked at her like that.

But of all times, why now?


The man looked at Zaria suspiciously, and Callum took the chance to continue. "If you want to take Cyrene, go ahead. Ria and I have to go look at wedding dresses tomorrow. We don't have time to waste on you."

As his words rang out, he even reached his hand out to Zaria while uttering gently, "Let's go, Ria."

Zaria felt a chill go through her body.

She finally understood.

Callum was using her as a shield. He was trying to divert the abductor's attention and spare Cyrene.

Sure enough, the man hesitated before suddenly shoving Cyrene aside and charging straight at Zaria.

"So, you're the one he loves most!" he shouted with a twisted smile. He yanked Zaria by the hair and dragged her toward the edge of the bridge.

Callum's pupils shrank as he lunged forward.

But the first person he grabbed was Cyrene.

"Cy…"

The man dragged Zaria off the bridge, falling straight down.

The wind roared in her ears. As the freezing river swallowed her, she heard Callum's cold voice from the bridge.

"Save the abductor first. Don't let him escape. Get him thrown in jail, and make sure he never comes back. We can't let him hurt Cy again!"

Zaria wanted to laugh. But water rushed into her lungs, and she blacked out.

Right before she lost consciousness, she finally understood that in Callum's heart, her life wasn't even worth more than an abductor's.

When Zaria woke up in the hospital, she heard the doctor's serious voice nearby.

"Ms. Slate is not just injured from the fall. Her body's already worn down due to years of stress, alcohol, and past medical issues. The current injury could have lasting consequences unless she really takes care of herself from now on. Otherwise—"

Before the doctor could finish, Callum had already noticed she was awake and hurried to her bedside.

"Ria, you're awake. How are you feeling? Are you hurting anywhere?" he asked, sounding unusually tense.

Zaria looked at him calmly.

If he really cared, he wouldn't have chosen to save the abductor without hesitation.

When she stayed silent, Callum reached out to touch her face. But she turned her head away.

He paused and said in a low voice, "I was careless this time. I'll make it up to you."

Zaria's lips curled up in a faint smile, but she said nothing.

"Callum, you owe me too much. You'll never make it up," Zaria thought.

Maybe out of guilt, Callum stayed with her at the hospital for two full days. When she was discharged, he immediately took her to an auction, saying it was to "make it up to her".

Zaria tried to refuse several times, but couldn't, so she went with him.

As soon as they arrived, they ran into Cyrene.

But this time, Callum didn't look at Cyrene even once. He stayed by Zaria's side the whole time. He would help her adjust her scarf, pour her water, manage her food, and occasionally ask her if she was cold.

Zaria knew he was acting.

But for whom?

Perhaps for himself, so he could feel less guilty and a bit more at ease.

Before the auction started, Callum got a phone call and left for a bit.

Zaria stood alone by the champagne table when a man walked over, smiling. "Miss, you're beautiful. Can we get to know each other?"

Before Zaria could respond, someone suddenly reached around from behind her. He gripped her waist and pulled her into an embrace.

"She's my fiancée." Callum's voice was icy. His eyes were cold as he stared at the man.

The man's expression changed. He quickly apologized and left.

Callum looked down at her. His brow was furrowed. "Ria, someone hit on you. Why didn't you turn him down?"

"We're not married yet, are we?" Zaria rebuked calmly.

Callum stroked her face. His voice was full of possessiveness. "We will be sooner or later."

"Who else could you possibly want to marry besides me?"

He locked eyes with her. "In this life, I'm marrying no one but you."

Zaria looked at him and suddenly smiled.

How ironic.

How could he say that when he didn't even love her?

After the auction began, Callum almost bought everything Zaria set her eyes on. He spent lavishly without hesitation.

Cyrene sat not far away. Her eyes were dark as she stared at them.

When Zaria went to the restroom, Cyrene followed her in.

She locked the door behind her and sneered. "Zaria, you're feeling pretty pleased with yourself today, aren't you? Need me to remind you? Callum only feels guilty toward you. It's guilt and not love. He still doesn't know that when you were pregnant, the baby was three months along, right?

"I cried and made a scene, saying I couldn't stand another woman having his child. And without a word, he gave you abortion pills. Just recently, when I had kidney failure, he didn't hesitate to have your kidney removed for me.

"Also, he claimed to hate me on that bridge, but it was just to push you toward danger. No matter where or when, as long as I need something, he will fulfill it."

Cyrene leaned in and said sweetly, "Zaria, you've lost completely!"

Cyrene had thought that once she said all that, she'd immediately see Zaria break down hysterically. It would've been incredibly satisfying for her.

But to her surprise, Zaria remained calm the entire time.

Turning the faucet off, Zaria looked up and asked, "Are you done?"

Cyrene froze.

Zaria dried her hands and added flatly, "I don't care."

After all, she was about to leave.

Cyrene looked at her in disbelief. "How could you not care? Zaria, you—"

Halfway through the accusation, Cyrene's expression suddenly shifted as she raised her hand and slapped herself hard.

The crisp sound of the slap echoed through the restroom.

Before Zaria could react, Callum had already rushed in and shoved her aside. "Zaria! What are you doing?"

Zaria staggered backward. Her lower back slammed hard against the sharp corner of the vanity. Her vision turned black due to the pain, and blood instantly streamed down from her temple.

However, Callum didn't even glance at her. He went straight to support Cyrene. His voice was ice-cold. "I've already made it up to you. Why are you still treating Cyrene like this?"

Cyrene covered her face. Her tears fell endlessly. "Callum, don't blame Zaria. It's all my fault…"

Callum's expression darkened. He picked Cyrene up in his arms and turned to leave.

Cyrene leaned against his chest, flashing Zaria a triumphant smile.

Zaria was left alone, leaning against the restroom wall. She laughed through her tears.

"Look at this, Zaria. You've spent ten years on this. And what did you get in return?" she asked herself in her mind.

…

That night, Callum didn't come home, and Zaria didn't call him once.

Her heart had completely died. She no longer worried about him or cared where he was or what he was doing.

Since she was about to leave, she invited a group of her friends and hosted a farewell party for herself at the most luxurious hotel in the city center.

The women got drunk. Their eyes were red with tears as they cursed Callum out.

"You gave so much to him. How could he treat you like this?"

"Franklin liked you back in school. It would've been way better if you were with him!"

Zaria just smiled and drank one glass after another.

After the party, she paid the bill and stood alone in the hallway to sober up.

Once she was clear-headed and about to leave, she suddenly heard Callum and Jovan arguing at the end of the hall.

"You're getting more and more ridiculous because of Cyrene! Just because she didn't like it, you made Zaria lose her baby. To save her, you took Zaria's kidney. And now, just because Cyrene said she wants a baby, you're really going to do it?"

"If I don't have one with her, she'll find someone else. I can't stand that," replied Callum in a frighteningly calm voice.

"And what about Zaria? Don't you think you've been mistreating her?" Jovan questioned, raising his voice slightly.

Callum was silent for a moment before asking blandly, "Isn't it already enough that I plan to marry her?"

Zaria stood frozen. Her nails dug into her palms.

The argument came to an end. Jovan couldn't persuade Callum and left in anger.

Callum also turned and walked away.

As if compelled, Zaria followed Callum. She saw him enter a suite.

The door wasn't fully closed. Through the gap, she saw Callum pressing Cyrene onto the bed. He undid his belt while lowering his head to kiss her.

"Cy, let's have a baby," he uttered hoarsely.

Cyrene giggled and wrapped her arms around his neck. "What about Zaria?"

Callum's hands paused for a moment. "She won't find out."

Zaria stood outside the door, quietly watching the whole scene.

She then raised her phone and recorded everything.

This time, she didn't even cry.

When the heart was dead, it no longer hurt.

The night before she left, the sky was dark.

Zaria was busy packing. Just as she folded the last piece of clothing and placed it in the suitcase, the sound of the door unlocking echoed.

Callum pushed the door open and entered. His suit jacket was casually draped over his arm. His tie was loosened slightly, and there was a faint scent of alcohol coming from him.

He stood at the doorway, and his gaze fell on her open suitcase. "Why are you packing?" he asked casually.

Zaria was just about to say that she was leaving, but Callum asked if she could teach him how to make herbal soup.

She froze. She was mildly surprised as she watched him enter the kitchen.

All these years, she had been the one who cooked. He never once did.

After a moment of silence, she still followed him.

In the kitchen, Callum stood at the counter. His sleeves were rolled up to his elbows, revealing well-defined forearms.

He was clumsily slicing an ingredient, clearly inexperienced.

Zaria stood beside him and taught him to make the soup.

"Don't turn the heat too high."

"Add the seasonings last."

"Once it boils, lower the heat."

The unusually patient Callum actually followed her instructions.

Once the soup was done, he took a sip, and his brows relaxed. "Not bad."

However, he didn't offer her any.

Callum didn't notice the look in her eyes. Glancing at his watch, he suddenly said, "Ria, I've got some things to take care of over the next few days. I'll spend time with you later."

After saying that, he picked up a thermos and poured the soup into it before taking his leave.

Zaria stood where she was and listened to the sound of the door closing.

She then took out her phone and pulled up Cyrene's Instagram.

Sure enough, Cyrene had posted something. 

"I'm suddenly craving herbal soup. Will anyone make it for me?"

Zaria turned off her phone and smiled faintly.

She had once learned to make this soup just for Callum.

He had stomach problems, and she heard that the soup was good for the stomach. So, she went to countless traditional restaurants and persuaded the owners to teach her. She could only master it after practicing countless times.

And now, the man who had never set foot in a kitchen was making the soup. But it was for Cyrene.

Love and the absence of love were like a continuous, repeating cycle.

On the morning of her departure, Zaria packed all her luggage alone.

There were still a few hours until her flight. She put on a hat and went out alone. She visited several places.
