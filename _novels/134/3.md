Once you fall completely out of love,

No matter how much you argue, it all feels pointless.

The pain in my neck reminded me just how foolish all my efforts over the years had been.

I could only give a self-mocking smile.

Zoe peeked out from behind Kevin at that moment.

I unexpectedly met her eyes, full of mockery.

It felt like my heart was being stabbed with needles, hurting even more.

The next second, her eyes turned red as she spoke to me in a slightly resentful tone:

"Big sis Lily, don't be angry. I just found the jade pendant and was planning to return it to you when I had the chance."

She rubbed Kevin's head.

"Kevin, don't blame big sis Lily anymore."

Kevin finally calmed down and reluctantly let go of me.

"Zoe is always so sensible."

"Lily, why can't you learn from her?!"

The near-suffocation left my whole body trembling.

Zoe pretended to come over and support me.

"Big sis Lily, can you forgive me?"

Her tone was slightly pleading, but I clearly saw the provocation and mockery in her eyes.

As if arrogantly saying: "Yes, I stole it and broke it. What can you do about it?"

I felt a chill run down my spine and disgustedly avoided her touch.

But Zoe took the opportunity to let out a shrill scream and fall backwards.

"Ah—"

She clutched her wrist, looking at me in terror.

"Big sis Lily, I just wanted to apologize to you..."

I hadn't even touched the hem of her clothes, yet I had become the bully.

Seeing Zoe fall, Kevin immediately anxiously crouched down to help her up, then turned to angrily berate me.

"Lily, didn't you hear Zoe say she just found the pendant? What's the point of taking it out on an innocent person like this?"

I almost laughed at his words.

The jade pendant Grandpa gave me was something I always treasured.

I had carefully kept it in the drawer in my bedroom.

Found it?

Are you telling me Zoe accidentally entered my house, accidentally walked into my bedroom, and then accidentally found the pendant in my most private bedside drawer?

I couldn't be bothered to expose this clumsy lie. I just smirked sarcastically.

"Fine then. I'll report it to the police and let them investigate exactly how Zoe 'found' my jade pendant!"

"And I'll press charges against you for assaulting me today!"

Zoe panicked and immediately clutched her chest.

"Kevin, my heart hurts so much..."

Hearing this, Kevin forgot about everything else and rushed to support Zoe to go to the hospital.

"Don't be afraid, Zoe. I won't let anything happen to you!"

As he passed by me, he glared viciously.

"Lily, you just wait! If anything happens to Zoe, I won't let you off the hook!"

He deliberately slammed into my shoulder hard.

Caught off guard, the impact sent me crashing to the floor.

But Kevin didn't even spare me a glance, just coldly snorted and left.
