Grandma, a billionaire, was on the brink of death, so I donated a kidney to save her. But once she recovered, she humiliated me by throwing me into a pile of garbage. When Grandpa arrived, they were laughing and forcing me to eat trash from the street.

Jasper coldly blocked Grandpa, saying, "He's just a lowly beggar, not worth your time."

Grandpa slapped him, "Who do you think you are? Just a toy my grandson picked up, and you dare lay a hand on him?"

The guests were shocked, exclaiming, "Oh my God! He's the true heir of the Mason Family!"

In my past life, I endured everything to please Sister and Grandma, but they ended up pushing me into the water, drowning me.

Reborn, I stormed into the birthday banquet and kicked him down. "A beggar picked up from the trash dares to impersonate a noble Young Master?"

The crowd was taken aback.
