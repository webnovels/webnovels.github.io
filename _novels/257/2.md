The live stream chat was scrolling furiously:

"Now THIS is a true genius, so graceful!"

"But what's with *Jian-nü*? What kind of parents give their daughter such a name in this day and age?"

"To the commenter above, word on the street is *Jian-nü* is the Montgomery family's real daughter who was swapped at birth. They just found her, but she looks like a lost cause."

"She looks so provocative, just begging for a punch! Whoever named her that is a genius!"

I ignored the immense malice directed at me in the live stream and spoke directly:

"Please, everyone, be my witness. I hope my parents keep their word when the scores come out."

"Oh, and everyone in the live stream too."

The live stream chat collectively spammed:

"I think she's truly lost it."

The day the SAT scores were released.

The reporter who interviewed me before showed up again.

He had become an overnight sensation because of me.

Unwilling to let go of this massive buzz, he had privately contacted me, worried I wouldn't make outrageous claims like I did on SAT days.

He insisted I maintain that persona.

He even offered me a cut of the profits.

Not just him, many big PR firms also sought me out, ready to tailor a public image for me. The moment the SAT scores were out, they wanted me to go live and simply announce I was the SAT top scorer.

No one believed a word I said.

While waiting for the scores, the reporter interviewed my parents, asking why I was so extreme.

Eleanor forced out two tears. "Today, after she faces reality, we'll send her to a mental hospital. After all, she's still my daughter."

Richard, meanwhile, put his arm around her, said a couple of comforting words, then immediately diverted the conversation to his company's new product.

I watched them coolly from the side.

If they truly considered me their daughter, they wouldn't have only brought me back right before the SATs.

Ten minutes before the scores were released, they put on a show of caring.

Richard said, "“*Jian-nü*,” apologize in the live stream now, it's not too late. Afterwards, we can just say you had a mental breakdown."

Eleanor added, "“*Jian-nü*,” must you bring shame to the Montgomery family? I swear, you're nothing but trouble since you came back. I wish I had never given birth to you."

Blake was as impatient as ever. "Are you really going to be a complete clown today? Have we been too good to you?"

I spoke up, genuinely surprised. "Good to me? With your words? I haven't felt it. Being good to me means making me live in the storage room, not giving me pocket money or even a ride, making me walk ten miles to school? And ignoring me when I was bullied?"

A flicker of awkwardness and discomfort crossed their faces.

Because after they brought me back, they literally never cared for me.

The staff were quick to follow their lead; if the Montgomerys didn't say anything, the staff wouldn't do anything.

Ashley, however, had red eyes. "“*Jian-nü*,” don't blame Mom and Dad. After the SAT scores come out, I'll give Mom and Dad back to you. I'll leave the Montgomery family."

The live stream chat exploded again:

"Is *Jian-nü* really having such a hard time? The Montgomery family didn't handle that well."

"Heh, serves her right! If I had a daughter like that, I wouldn't even bring her home!"

Richard, Eleanor, and Blake immediately rushed to comfort Ashley. "Ashley, don't apologize to her. She's not worthy!"

"If you leave the Montgomery family, you'd be killing us!"

"Ashley, I'm not someone who values blood ties. I only recognize you as my sister."

I spoke lazily. "You keep calling me '“*Jian-nü*”' – 'Wretched Girl.' But that name was truly meant for Ashley. It's what *her* birth parents, the Roberts, named her."

My parents and Blake immediately glared at me.

Ashley's tears fell even faster. "“*Jian*”... Sister, I know you're upset with me..."

I had no patience for it. I cut her off directly. "Ashley, let's make a bet. If you score worse than me, how about you take the name '“*Jian-nü*”'?"

"If I score worse than you, I'll get out of the Montgomery family."
