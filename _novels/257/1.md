The words had barely left my lips when my parents' faces grew even darker.

Blake looked utterly livid. "“*Jian-nü*,” I think you've lost your mind. We should send you to a mental hospital right now."

Eleanor looked disgusted. "I don't know what on earth you told your grandmother to make her bring you back, but now you've completely disgraced the Montgomery family."

"If it weren't for the DNA test, I'd never believe you were my daughter."

The next second, her gaze softened, falling on Ashley. "Our Ashley is so sensible, so graceful and poised. She doesn't pull these attention-seeking stunts."

Ashley let out a soft "Oh dear." "Sister, are you short on cash or something? Is that why you're trying to go for a controversial route, then just go into live streaming sales? If you need money, just ask Mom and Dad! They wouldn't deny you. Making such a spectacle of yourself outside, people might think Mom and Dad are abusing you."

She finished, leaning sweetly against Eleanor's shoulder, her eyes fixed on me with disdain and mockery.

Richard, who always prioritized appearances, snapped, "Nonsense!"

"When we get home, confiscate all her electronics. Lock her up! She's not coming out until she apologizes!"

I watched them – a picture of a united, harmonious family of four, all against me.

My heart didn't stir an inch.

I even smiled.

Blake's face was grim. "“*Jian-nü*,” what are you smiling at?"

I shrugged. "SAT scores will be out soon. Why are you all in such a hurry?"

"Anyway, you've never cared about me, have you?"

Blake had zero patience. "Who doesn't know you used to score two, three hundred? Don't blame others for not caring if your grades are trash!"

I was the real Montgomery heiress, swapped by the Roberts family.

From childhood, my grades were absolutely terrible.

They only brought me back two months before the SATs.

My last mock exam before the SATs was just as bad as before.

They completely gave up on me.

They simply ignored that I was also taking the SATs, showering Ashley with attention and care every single day.

On SAT day, my father, Richard, who was always swamped with work, canceled everything.

My mother, Eleanor, who had daily appointments with socialites, canceled all her engagements.

My brother, Blake, who was busy with various university activities, also cleared his schedule.

All for Ashley's SATs.

Not only that, they thought I was bad luck, fearing I would jinx Ashley's performance. They only dropped her off at the exam hall.

Every time they saw me walking out of the exam, they'd look at me as if I were some unlucky charm, and when we got home, they'd even try to ward off bad luck around me, as if I were contaminated.

Ashley stepped forward, playing the good person. "Mom, Dad, *Jian-nü* probably just hasn't experienced this much attention before. It's probably just vanity acting up."

"Besides, the SAT scores will be out soon. Just let her have her little moment for a couple of days."

"“*Jian-nü*,” just apologize to Mom and Dad. We can let this go."
