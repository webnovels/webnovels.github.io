A steady stream of agonized moans echoed from deep within a room off the first-floor hallway of Greenstein Manor.

Inside, Rosalea Lovelace lay sprawled on the floor, every bone in her body feeling like it was being eaten alive by poison, pain tearing through her limbs. She'd been hiding for two years, but they'd finally found her.

Vance Greenstein had brought in a team of elite doctors to treat her. He even had rare equipment flown in from overseas. He despised her so much that he'd spend a fortune just to keep her close and ensure her misery.

When Vance walked into the room, he saw Rosalea barely clinging to life.

Sandra Lester rushed over. "Mr. Greenstein, Mrs. Greenstein's condition has flared up again. Should we have the doctors check on her?"

Vance didn't respond. He waved Sandra off.

She hesitated for a second, then turned and walked out. After all, she was just a housekeeper. It wasn't her place to get involved in her employer's affairs.

Once they were alone, Rosalea kept trying to get up, again and again. She couldn't stand the idea of Vance seeing her like this. But on her last attempt, she collapsed at his feet, too weak to rise.

She slowly lifted her head, forcing a faint smile onto her pale, exhausted face. "It's been a while."

Vance took her in from head to toe, his expression devoid of sympathy.

"You did this to yourself. I'm not letting you off the hook that easily. You still owe me," he muttered.

His hatred for her was as strong as ever.

Vance crouched down, gripped her chin, and added, "Two years ago, you used the power Grandpa left behind to run away. And look at you now. You're barely even human after just two years. Where's that guy? Did he finally ditch you?"

The same wave of exhaustion hit Rosalea again, just like it had two years ago.

She took a deep breath and asked, "Why can't you believe me? I'm your wife."

Vance's hand drifted down to her collarbone, where a faint red mark stood out against her otherwise pale skin. There used to be a tattoo there—his initials—back when they were so in love they wanted the whole world to see that they belonged to each other.

Everything changed when Vance's sister, Augusta Greenstein, died because of Rosalea. The word "wife" sharpened Vance's gaze.

"What did you do when I trusted you? Quit acting like you don't know. The only reason you're still holding onto the title of Mrs. Greenstein is because Eugenia begged me," he spat.

Eugenia Ottley was Vance's childhood sweetheart.

After Augusta's death, Rosalea had no way to prove that she wasn't guilty, as all the evidence pointed directly at her. While she scrambled for any kind of lead, Eugenia's men found Augusta's body first.

During the autopsy, the coroner found a small recorder on Augusta. It still had a recording inside, and it played two lines from the most damning part of a conversation.

"Vance's spot in Greenstein Group isn't secure enough yet. Give it another two years, and I'll make sure he marries you."

"How dare you try to stop me from marrying Vance! Don't tell me that you've got feelings for your own brother. That's just nasty."

At first, Vance couldn't believe it. But once the forensic test confirmed that it was Rosalea's voice, he had no choice but to face the truth.

After that, Rosalea's parents—Norman Lovelace and Delia Arminger—went bankrupt. Her brother, Clyde Lovelace, was left permanently disabled in a car accident.

Worried that the whole Lovelace family would fall apart, Rosalea tried to take her own life. She was saved, but it was then that the doctors found out that she was pregnant. Unfortunately, the baby didn't make it.

When Rosalea was three months pregnant, Eugenia casually tossed a used handkerchief onto a pond with thin ice and insisted Rosalea get it back. Rosalea refused, but Vance's bodyguard kicked her into the freezing water anyway.

Later, all Vance had flatly said was, "She can't even fetch a handkerchief. What a useless thing."

He never once asked about the baby.

Eventually, Rosalea discovered the truth. Vance had never intended to let her keep the baby. He didn't think that she had any right to carry his child.

After losing the baby, Rosalea fell into a deep depression and tried to end her life more than once. Vance let her hurt herself, knowing that the doctors would save her before it was too late. He made her live through hell in his own twisted way.

The memories hit Vance hard.

Bringing himself back to the moment, he emphasized every word as he said, "You deserve something worse than death. That's the only way Augusta's soul will ever find peace."
