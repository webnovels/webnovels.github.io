"This is our last chance to evacuate. If we don't leave now, we'll all die here!" Several team members were shouting themselves hoarse trying to persuade Mia, who was blocking the exit with her body.

"Jake hasn't arrived yet. What's wrong with waiting just five more minutes?!" Mia's face was cold as ice, refusing to budge an inch.

"You want to risk all our lives just to wait for him?! Mia, don't be so selfish!" The team members were anxious to the point of panic.

Someone who couldn't stand it anymore rushed forward to pull her away.

But in the next second, Mia raised her gun and fired.

The bullet grazed past everyone's scalps, instantly causing a chorus of shocked cries.

"Are you crazy?!"

Faced with everyone's condemnation, Mia snapped back:

"You're despicable! Shameless! Selfish!"

"Jake hasn't arrived yet, so no one's getting on that plane today! You cowards who are afraid of death, how can you bear to abandon a comrade at the critical moment? Do you even deserve to live?"

Hearing this, the deputy commander looked at me with a troubled expression:

"Alex, the military chopper is about to close its doors. If we delay any longer... I'm afraid we might..."

I smiled slightly, gesturing for everyone to calm down.

Then I walked over to Mia's side and gently put my hand on her shoulder:

"Mia's right. Our team has always upheld the principle of never abandoning anyone. Although Jake didn't make it to the meeting point on time, how can we just leave him behind?"

Hearing these words, everyone present was dumbfounded.

They couldn't believe I would say such a thing.

"Captain, what... what are you saying? How can you side with Mia just because she's your girlfriend?"

"Shut up!" Mia raised her gun and fired another burst into the air.

"Alex has spoken. We must wait for Jake to arrive before evacuating together. Why are you all talking so much?!"

Armed with the truth and my support, Mia was unbearably smug at this moment.

She leaned close against my shoulder and said in a soft voice:

"Alex, I knew you were different from those guys. You always stick to your principles no matter what."

I smirked and patted her head.

"Jake and I are brothers who've been through life and death together. How could I possibly abandon him?"

But Mia didn't know that I actually didn't need to squeeze onto this helicopter at all.

As a top virologist, I only needed to make one phone call, and the military would send an armed force and a private plane to pick me up at any time.

And in my team, except for Mia and Jake, everyone else was a top talent in their field.

If it weren't for wanting to bring the weak and incompetent Mia along to evacuate in my previous life, I could have easily chosen a safer private plane and gone to the camp with my teammates.

In this life, I want to make her pay the most brutal price for her stupid and selfish decision.

Let her be dragged down to hell along with her precious childhood friend, whom she kept thinking about but who repeatedly almost caused the team's downfall.

Seeing that no one dared to rebel, Mia became even more smug.

And so, time ticked by minute by minute, as the dark mass of the zombie horde gradually approached in the distance.

Until Jake finally arrived late.

"Mia, I knew you'd wait for me!" Jake was panting heavily, his eyes full of excitement.

Given his physical condition, it was almost a miracle that he managed to run from the east side of the city to the helipad.

Mia let out a long sigh of relief and smiled.

However, at that moment, a deafening explosion came from the distance
— the last line of defense had been breached by the zombie horde.
