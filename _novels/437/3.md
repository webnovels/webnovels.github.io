With rescue on the way and ample supplies in the shelter, Mia completely let her guard down over the next few days.

She started wasting resources recklessly with Jake.

Using purified water from the water purifier to wash clothes, taking antibiotics meant for emergencies as health supplements, and even dismantling electronic equipment for batteries to power a music player.

Until the evening of the third day, just half an hour before rescue was due to arrive.

Mia suddenly barged in, interrupting my meeting with the team members.

"Alex, give me the serum quickly." She ordered bluntly.

I frowned and looked up: "What do you need the serum for? Has someone been infected?"

But Mia's answer made everyone's jaws drop.

"No! But Jake has a fever. It's up to 102°F now. I gave him fever reducers but they didn't work!"

"Stop wasting time and give me the serum. I need to inject it into him."

I slowly stood up, my voice turning cold:

"Do you know what this serum means? I spent three years developing it. It can stop the zombie virus from spreading within five minutes of infection."

"Although it's still in the experimental stage, it's humanity's last hope right now, and I only have one dose left."

"Oh come on, I know!" Mia waved her hand impatiently.

"But the anti-virus serum can kill all viruses, right? Jake is in a lot of pain right now. Stop dawdling, will you? Hurry up!"

The entire meeting room suddenly fell deathly quiet.

The deputy commander couldn't bear to watch anymore and slammed the table as he stood up:

"Mia, did you lose your mind? You want to waste such precious serum on a mere fever?!"

"What do you mean waste?!" Mia shrilly retorted.

"Jake has always been weak. What if the fever causes complications? Besides... isn't the serum meant to save people?"

Seeing that I remained unmoved, Mia's eyes suddenly turned vicious.

She actually raised her gun and aimed it at my forehead.

"Hand it over. Don't make me do this!"

"Mia, have you gone crazy? How could you..."

Just as a teammate was about to step forward to stop her, he was nearly shot by Mia.

Looking at this woman I once loved deeply, I suddenly felt incredibly absurd.

In my previous life, I had escaped death so many times to protect her.

And now, she was actually threatening my life for the sake of Jake.

As unwilling as they were, my teammates had no choice but to hand over that sole dose of serum.

We watched helplessly as Mia injected it into Jake.
