In a rush of adrenaline, I blurted out, "Hubby!"

He just chuckled, a glint in his eye. "Only half a billion and you're calling me 'hubby'? What if it was five billion, would you marry me then?"

My eyes widened. "Is that even an option?"

**1**

Early that morning, a text notification jolted me awake.

Still half-asleep, I picked up my phone, then practically shot up from bed the moment I saw it.

My bank account. Half a billion dollars.

The sender? My boss, Damon Thorne.

Was my boss kidnapped? Did he lose his mind? Why would he randomly send me half a billion? My hand trembled as I dialed Damon Thorne's number.

The second he picked up, my nerves got the best of me, and I stammered, "B-b-b-boss... hubby..."

The moment the word left my lips, I wanted to bite my tongue off.

Just because half a billion landed in my account didn't mean I could abandon my principles and call my boss "hubby." There was a long silence on the other end.

"What? I just gave you half a billion and you're calling me 'hubby' already?"

Me: "..."

My bad, sir! My bad!

"Five minutes. I'm waiting downstairs."

Classic domineering CEO vibe.

I rushed downstairs. A Rolls-Royce was parked by the entrance—the same car I'd helped him choose.

I stood in front of the car, bowing slightly. "Good morning, Boss."

Inside, a man with sharp features and an undeniable aura of power sat. He gave me a cool glance, then his thin lips parted. "Get in."

My heart hammered in my chest as I cautiously slid inside.

"Starting today, until midnight on the 10th of next month, you must spend all half a billion dollars I've given you."

His words were concise.

Me: "?"

He added, "Don't ask why. Just spend the money. If you fail to complete the task..."

His eyes narrowed slightly. "You'll have hell to pay."

I instinctively touched my neck, a shiver running down my spine.

Half a billion dollars! This wasn't just a few thousand. I was just an average person; I'd never seen so much money. How was I even supposed to spend it all? I had absolutely no clue.

"Can I buy a house?" I asked cautiously.

He shook his head. "No. Property purchases are invalid."

"Then, stocks?"

"Stock purchases are invalid."

"What about—"

My boss seemed annoyed by my questions. He simply tossed a document at me. I opened it and my face just fell.

It was full of legal jargon, but the gist was clear: "I cannot use this half a billion to generate personal assets, nor can I donate it..."

This was impossible!

"Boss, what am I supposed to do then?"

Damon was ruthless. "I'm only responsible for giving you the money. The rest is up to you."

He gave me a month off from work.

My sole task for that month was to spend all half a billion. Not a single cent could be left in the account.

I sent a SnapChat to my best friend, Chloe, asking for help: *Hey, girl, how do I spend money?*

*Spend what money? You're the kind of person who only has five bucks and change in your account, can't even get extra cheese on your bagel!*

I paused for a moment: *Actually, I probably have enough money to buy every bagel shop in the world now. Chloe, calm down. I need to tell you something. I have half a billion dollars.*

Chloe: *What kind of dream are you having in broad daylight?*

I screenshotted my bank balance and sent it to her.

Five minutes later, Chloe replied.

*Alright, smarty pants, you've learned to Photoshop. And it's not April Fool's Day, sis.*

*I'm not lying! I really have half a billion.*

Chloe rushed over to my place. After calling the bank and confirming I wasn't joking, her eyes looked at me differently. Her eyes practically screamed, "Sugar Mama, feed me!"

"There's a job for you. Are you interested?" I asked.

I raised my hand. "I'll pay you this much."

Chloe: "Five thousand a month?"

I replied, "Five million a month."

Chloe nearly fainted. When she came to, she grabbed my hand. "Girl, from today on, you're my breadwinner, my lifeline!"

**2**

I immediately transferred five million to Chloe and had her sign a contract.

Because every dollar I spent, and how I spent it, had to be accounted for.

After Chloe left, I was about to take a shower and get into bed to figure out my next spending strategy when Damon called. "How come you only spent five million today?"

*Only!*

"Boss, I'll try harder tomorrow."

He was silent for a moment, then patiently asked, "What did you do today?"

I dutifully explained everything.

His tone on the other end seemed to relax. "Looks like you haven't become completely brain-dead from following me around all these years. You know how to think outside the box. Keep it up."

The next day, Chloe excitedly called me. "I've thought of a great way to spend money!"

"What is it?"

"Rent a yacht."

Have you ever been on a luxury yacht?

I have.

With my boss.

He was invited to some yacht party, and I went with him.

Looking at the incredibly lavish yacht, my mouth hung open wide enough to fit a golf ball. I casually asked my boss, "How much does a yacht like this cost?"

He replied indifferently, "Probably over a hundred million."

If buying a yacht cost over a hundred million, how much would renting one cost?

The yacht manager looked me and Chloe up and down, a hint of disdain in his eyes. "Our yachts, even if we rent them out, have a strict vetting process."

"What's the vetting process?" Chloe asked cautiously.

The manager snorted. "Minimum capital verification of ten million dollars."

I handed him my phone.

The yacht manager's face instantly went green. His attitude did a complete 180-degree turn. "Oh, my! You're clearly a young lady from a prominent family! Such elegance! You want to rent a yacht for a birthday party, right? I can arrange it for you."

I waved him off. "No need. What's your highest daily rental fee?"

"Three hundred thousand a day."

"That's too little. How about five hundred thousand a day, and I'll rent it for ten days?"

The yacht manager looked incredulous. "Five hundred thousand?"

"Do you think it's too little? Then I'll add another hundred thousand a day."

The deal was smoothly closed. After signing the rental agreement, I held the contract, deep in worry. "Spending money is exhausting."

Chloe gave me a thumbs-up. "I used to think you were timid and meek, like a frightened little bird. I never expected you to be so domineering when spending money!"

I didn't want to be.

Last night, I had a nightmare.

I dreamed I hadn't spent the half a billion in a month, and my boss was looking at me with a sinister glare, holding a cleaver, saying he'd chop me into a million pieces if I didn't spend the money.

I woke up crying.

Then I checked my bank balance and cried even harder.

I had to speed up my spending.

The moment I transferred the money, my boss called. "What have you done?"

Ugh.

I suspected my boss had nothing better to do all day than watch my account.

"N-nothing, I promise. I'll spend the money strictly according to the rules in the contract. Don't worry."

I told Chloe to contact our high school classmates to prepare for the party.

Chloe contacted a bunch of people, but they all thought I was joking.

Chloe asked me what to do.

I pondered for a moment. "Just tell them that everyone who comes will get a one hundred thousand dollar gift envelope."

Chloe didn't understand my logic.

She was supposed to be my assistant.

I explained, "It's my birthday today. They're coming to my birthday party. If they give me a fifty-dollar gift, I should give them something back, right?"

Chloe gave me another thumbs-up. "Your way of thinking is truly bizarre."

The next day, looking at the overwhelming crowd, I twitched my lips. "I remember our class only had fifty people, right? Isn't this a bit too many?"

**3**

Chloe laughed. "It's fine if they're from the same school!"

I nodded. "Whatever. The more, the merrier. One more person means I can spend another hundred thousand. Worth it. Count the number of people, and we'll hand out the gift envelopes later."

Chloe thumped her chest. "With that humble-bragging tone, consider it handled!"

That evening, the yacht was brightly lit and buzzing with activity.

I stood on the deck, holding a glass of champagne, gazing into the distance, and sighed deeply. "I used to only think making money was hard. Now I realize spending money is even harder."

A sarcastic voice drifted over. "A country bumpkin, no matter how dressed up, is still a country bumpkin. What are you trying to prove?"

That familiar voice.

I turned around and saw my high school nemesis, Tiffany Woods.

Tiffany came from a wealthy family and was always the center of attention in class. She looked down on "poor people" like me, so she'd bully me constantly.

Sometimes she'd corner me in the restroom, sometimes she'd rip my test papers, sometimes she'd throw my backpack in the water.

I always—endured it.

Because my mom used to say, "Child, our family has no backing. We came from the countryside. Just bear with it. Studying hard is the most important thing."

What could I do?

When I couldn't bear it anymore, I just endured it more.

But my endurance only led to Tiffany's bullying escalating.

How did Chloe invite that menace?

"What's wrong? Did you win the lottery?"

I eyed her. "Yeah, are you jealous?"

I subtly looked her over, then casually remarked, "Your bracelet looks pretty expensive, doesn't it?"

She preened like a peacock. "Of course! This bracelet is a limited edition."

My bad, I had one too. Just the genuine article.

Of course, I rented it.

But the cost of renting it for one day was enough to buy that bracelet.

My heart squeezed, like taking a sip of soda straight from the fridge. A sharp pang hit me, then a wave of pure relief.

But then I thought, this isn't my money. Why should I feel a pang?

I deliberately rotated my wrist. "Ugh, why does my hand feel so sore?"

Chloe appeared at just the right moment. "Oh my god, why are there two identical bracelets?"

Chloe's loud voice attracted a crowd.

I put on an innocent act. "I don't know! Maybe mine's a fake? When I flew on a private jet to pick it up a while ago, the sales associate told me it was one-of-a-kind in the world."

Chloe and I played along. "You know, high-end knock-offs are getting really good these days!"

Everyone's eyes weren't blind; they could tell the real thing from the fake at a glance.

Under everyone's scornful gazes, Tiffany ran away with her tail between her legs.

I figured she wouldn't dare show her face in public for a long time.

Spending several million to get my revenge was definitely worth it.

As for why I was wearing *that* bracelet? Coincidence?

No way.

If I hadn't done my research beforehand, I wouldn't have gone to such lengths for this stunt.

The way she humiliated me back then, I was going to make her embarrass herself in front of everyone now.

"Smiling so happily? Did you find some money?"

A familiar voice came from not far away.

That voice.

My scalp tightened.

Damon Thorne emerged from the shadows, looking at me with a half-smile. "You spent millions renting a bracelet just to show off?"

Oh, crap.

Was he here to settle accounts?

Didn't he say I could spend the half a billion however I wanted?

Why was he coming back to haunt me now?

"Good evening, Boss."

He glanced around, a slight curl of his lips. "So this is how you spend money, Riley Morgan. I'm impressed. You used to be so timid and frugal, and now with half a billion, you've completely let loose."

My tongue slipped. "It's all thanks to you, Boss!"

He shot me a side-eye.

I quickly corrected myself. "No, no, Boss, I'm just diligently spending money to meet your expectations!"

He looked at me quietly, then said, "Just be careful with that bracelet. Don't scratch or bump it. And remember to return it when you're done."

"Yes, sir!"

Seeing that Damon wasn't leaving, my smile became a little strained. "Boss, it's getting late?"

**4**

He nodded. "I know."

You know? Then why aren't you leaving? Do you want me to invite you to stay the night?

"So, Boss, good night?"

I was already hinting so obviously.

My boss let out an exaggerated yawn. "It is late. Take me to my room."

I was completely petrified. "You're staying overnight on the yacht?"

He smiled. "What's wrong? I contributed fifty dollars for your birthday, and I even brought a gift. Don't I have the right to stay overnight on the yacht? Oh, and don't forget to send me my hundred thousand dollar gift envelope later."

I wanted to cry.

Goodbye, my cute younger guys.

I had planned to party all night with them.

Now, they had all turned into sea foam.

"Why do you look a little disappointed?"

Damon watched me with amusement.

I gave a dry laugh. "Haha, not at all, not at all! Boss, it's an honor to have you at my birthday party!"

"Flatterer."

He rolled his eyes at me.

I rented the yacht for ten days, but I couldn't party all night, every night.

Because I had to spend money quickly.

After Chloe handled the yacht arrangements, she followed me onto a private jet, loaded with bags.

It was Chloe's first time on a private jet, and she was as excited as a giddy ape. I, however, had grown accustomed to it.

Before, I was serving my boss. Now, others were serving me.

For the first half of my life, my travels were limited to company team-building trips.

Bali, Maldives, Provence—to me, they were just names associated with money.

But now, we chartered a private jet and visited every place we wanted to see.

We enjoyed the highest level of luxury.

We stayed in presidential suites.

We ate gourmet food.

But after all the fun, a deep sense of emptiness settled in.

I don't know if you've ever felt this way.

When you were a kid, you craved ice cream. You'd think about it constantly, even study incredibly hard to get a perfect score just to earn it.

But once you finally had it...

It just felt... average.

I lay on the soft bed and asked Chloe, "How much money have we spent so far?"

"All in all, about twenty million."

I covered my face and sighed deeply. "Why is spending money so hard?"

Damon also came to check on my progress.

And he didn't just call; he came in person.

I couldn't sleep that night, planning to use the moonlight to seriously brainstorm how to spend more money.

But then, my boss already occupied the best spot.

Seeing his tall, slender figure, I froze. "B-b-b-boss?"

He turned around, moonlight falling on him. In the shadows, his dark eyes seemed to absorb the night, making his emotions unreadable.

"I'm only thirty. Not old yet." he said.

"You're not... stalking me, are you?"

He said indifferently, "I'm not that bored. I'm here on a business trip, and I thought I'd observe your spending progress. But your spending speed is really too slow. You have less than twenty days left, and you still have over four hundred million to spend."

My head ached.

I couldn't hold it in anymore. "Boss, why do you insist on giving me half a billion and making me spend it in a month, with so many rules? Are you playing some kind of game?"

He pursed his lips. "Don't ask too many questions. In short, the money I gave you is clean. Spend it without worry."

Well, that put my mind at ease.

He was so rich, half a billion was probably a drop in the ocean to him.

"Boss, spending money is so tiring."

I complained to him without thinking.

His eyes seemed to hold starlight, and he wasn't as strict as usual. "You seem to be having a lot of fun spending it."

"Think bigger."

He patted my shoulder. "Besides having fun, you can do other things."

A thought sparked in my mind. "Boss, do you mean I can get some boy toys—"

His eyes instantly became extremely dangerous, his voice like it was forced out through gritted teeth. "You can try."

I instinctively shrank my neck.

I was just joking. Why did he look like he was about to chop me up and feed me to dogs?

What was he so jealous about?

But his words gave me an idea.

Eating, drinking, and playing—even if I burned through money, it would be too slow.

Why didn't I invest in a movie?

A single investment of several hundred million.

Wouldn't that be fast?

The next day, I headed back, bringing my party-crazed best friend with me.

Knowing I wanted to invest in a movie, Chloe was a little worried. "Didn't your boss say this half a billion couldn't generate personal assets?"
