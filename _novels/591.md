Chapter 1
After five years of marriage, Rebecca Alcott had resolved to pursue a divorce.

When she arrived at the office, she saw the secretary bringing some documents to Stanley. She casually offered to deliver them instead, saying it was on her way, and quietly slipped the divorce agreement into the pile. 

Stanley was on the phone when he received the documents. He signed everything without even looking, including the divorce agreement.

Rebecca stared at the signed divorce papers, momentarily dazed. It was all finally coming to an end.

Just as she was about to pick up the documents and leave, her arm accidentally bumped into the delicate photo frame on the desk. It toppled over with a sharp crash, and shards of glass scattered in all directions.

The woman in the photo wore a radiant smile, but half of her face was now obscured by broken glass. It was Mia Scott, Stanley's long-dead first love. She was the one he had never let go of.

Stanley ended his phone call abruptly. He shouted furiously, "What are you doing?"

He shot to his feet and shoved Rebecca hard.

She stumbled back, losing her balance. Her hand landed on the shattered glass scattered across the floor. 

A sharp pain shot through her palm. She clenched her teeth, refusing to cry out, but tears welled up uncontrollably in her eyes.

She lowered her head and watched blood drip from her fingers onto the documents, staining them red.

However, Stanley seemed oblivious to her pain. He bent down to pick up the photo, gently brushing away the shards of glass with painstaking care, as if terrified of causing even the slightest damage. His movements were tender and focused, as though he were handling something infinitely precious.

Rebecca felt a deep sorrow as she looked at him. They had been married for five years. Yet somehow, even as a living person, she still couldn't compare to a photograph.

"What are you still doing here? From now on, don't come into my office without my permission." Stanley glared at her icily.

Rebecca said nothing. She simply gathered the scattered documents from the floor and turned to leave in silence. Blood was still oozing from her palm, but she couldn't feel any pain.

Just as she reached the doorway, she heard Stanley make another phone call.

His voice was still cold, but carried a hint of urgency. "Have you found a stand-in who looks like Mia?"

The person on the other end said something, and Stanley's voice quivered with barely suppressed pain. "Keep looking! Why is it that after all these years, I still haven't come across a single stand-in who looks like her? Why does fate have to be so cruel to me…"

Rebecca paused mid-step, a wave of bitterness washing over her. She lowered her head, gazing at her bloodied palm. A faint, bitter smile tugged at her lips.

She thought, "Stanley, you couldn't find someone like Mia. But I did. Don't worry, I'll train her well… then deliver her to you myself."

Rebecca took a cab to one of her villas. The car sped through bustling streets, the scenery outside flashing by in a blur. Yet, her thoughts drifted back to the past.

She and Stanley had grown up together. They had been childhood friends since they were little. She had loved him for ten whole years.

But Stanley had already given his heart away. Ever since Mia appeared, there was no one else in his gaze.

However, Mia fell seriously ill and passed away at just 20 years old. From that moment on, Stanley became withdrawn and joyless. Ultimately, he reluctantly agreed to the marriage alliance with Rebecca's family.

Everyone knew how much Rebecca loved Stanley. Despite this, she endured when he built a memorial for Mia in their home and honored her daily. 

She tolerated the bedside photos of Mia and his conversations with them. Even when he became obsessed with finding someone who looked like Mia, she still remained silent.

She thought that if she stayed by his side long enough, he would eventually turn around and fall in love with her. She even dared to dream that one day he'd forget Mia, that they'd have a child together, and live out a happy life. But reality shattered that illusion without mercy.

She experienced three pregnancies, all ending in miscarriage. She initially believed her body was the reason she couldn't carry a child to term.

It wasn't until her third miscarriage that she accidentally overheard a conversation between Stanley and his close friend.

"Stanley, every time Rebecca gets pregnant, you ensure she loses the baby. If she ever finds out, it'll destroy her."

"Whether she suffers or not has nothing to do with me. If I had a child with another woman, Mia would not rest in peace," Stanley replied.

She then realized those miscarriages were not accidental. Stanley had been the one giving her drugs to induce a miscarriage each time. All because he thought Mia couldn't rest in peace.

A chill ran through her, numbing her to the core. 

That night, she went to a bar to escape her pain, but ended up saving a young woman from being sold to an older man by her parents.

Her face looked just like Mia's back in the day. At that moment, as Rebecca stared at her face, a wild, unthinkable idea surged through her mind.

Since he couldn't let go of Mia, then she—the legitimate wife—would step aside. And at the same time, she'd give him a gift. She would train this woman to replace Mia so that she could stay by Stanley's side forever.

…

At Mistlake Villa, Rebecca pushed open the door and saw Nadia Thorne. She was following the instructions of the tutor Rebecca had hired to dress like Mia.

She wore a white dress with a rounded collar, paired with a delicate pearl necklace that made her look sweet and innocent. The only flaw was her hair. It was dull and brittle from malnutrition. 

Moreover, she was too skinny. But then again, that thin frame made her resemble the ailing Mia even more.

For a moment, Rebecca was a little dazed. She provided guidance instinctively. "Mia prefers wearing white dresses. Her hair should be softly curled, and the perfume should be jasmine-scented."

Nadia nodded obediently, her voice gentle. "Rebecca, I'll do my best to learn."

She didn't want to marry an old man. What she really wanted was to escape her parasitic parents.

Rebecca had shown her a photo of Stanley. He was tall, refined, handsome, with an air of noble detachment. 

He was the kind of man she could never have charmed in the life she came from. She was more than willing to stay with him. That was why she had been learning so diligently lately.

Rebecca looked at her, emotions churning. She reached out and gently stroked Nadia's hair. "You've got her vibe already. Very soon, I'll personally send you to his side."


Chapter 2
After leaving Mistlake Villa, Rebecca returned to the place she had once called "Home."

She opened the door, and nothing but silence enveloped the space. She immediately went to the study, turned on her computer, and booked a one-way ticket for a month later.

All she had to do was get through the mandatory one-month divorce cooling-off period. After that, she would be free, and she could go wherever she pleased.

She believed she would build the life she truly wanted and meet someone who genuinely loved her. As for Stanley, he would be gone from her world for good.

At night, Stanley staggered through the door. He was extremely drunk. 

His tie hung loosely, and his suit jacket was casually draped over one arm. His eyes were glazed, and he walked unsteadily. But when he got close to Rebecca, a spark ignited in his gaze.

He seemed to catch a familiar scent. His eyes burned with intensity, as if he were seeing something he'd long yearned for but lost. "Mia…"

His voice trembled, laced with endless longing and pain. He suddenly pulled Rebecca into his arms, holding her tightly as if he wanted to become one with her.

"Mia, you've finally come back to see me. I've missed you so much. This time, I'm never letting you go again…"

Rebecca's body stiffened, as if something had pierced her chest. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath to calm herself.

Then she gently pushed him away, her voice cold and clear. "You've got the wrong person. I'm not Mia."

Stanley stumbled back, suddenly sobering up quite a bit. He let go of her and took a step back. The intensity in his gaze dimmed, giving way to a flicker of cold annoyance.

"The scent of your perfume…" His voice was low, tinged with displeasure. "It's Mia's favorite. Don't wear it again."

Rebecca felt a sense of despair. Her fingers curled tightly, almost digging into her palms.

She lifted her head and looked him straight in the eyes. She replied indifferently, "Alright. I won't wear it again."

Stanley said nothing else and walked to the bedroom, appearing cold and distant.

Rebecca stayed in place, watching him disappear behind the door, feeling a chill in her chest. She gazed at her hand. Deep crescent marks from her nails had already formed in her palm.

The next day was their wedding anniversary. Rebecca had assumed Stanley would ignore it, just like he did every other year.

But to her surprise, he actually suggested taking her out for a candlelit dinner. The restaurant was softly lit, with gentle music playing in the background.

Stanley sat across from her, looking aloof, as if the whole evening were nothing more than a formality. He opened the menu and, without much hesitation, ordered some food.

Rebecca glanced at the selections, and her heart sank slightly. They were all Mia's favorite foods.

Just as the waiter was about to leave, Rebecca suddenly spoke up. "Wait a moment."

Stanley looked up and frowned with a hint of displeasure.

"I don't like these dishes. Let's change them," she said calmly, but with a quiet firmness that left no room for argument.

Stanley paused, a flicker of surprise crossing his face. He set down the menu, his gaze settling on her face, as if trying to read her expression. "Weren't these your favourites? I remember you enjoying them."

Rebecca looked up and met his eyes. "That was in the past. Besides, those were Mia's favorites, not mine. I don't like them, and I never will."

Stanley's frown deepened, a trace of confusion and simmering anger in his eyes. "Rebecca, is this your new way of trying to get my attention? I've told you when we got married that my heart belongs to Mia. 

"You agreed to that, said you could accept it, and that's why you married me. So what's the point of saying all this nonsense now? Are you trying to compete with her? Does that make you feel better?"

Rebecca didn't respond. She simply lowered her head and gently swirled the wine in her glass. She was calm, as if his words no longer stirred any emotion in her.

She used to eat foods she disliked, even ones that triggered her allergies, just to spend more time with him. But now, she no longer wanted to compromise.

Chapter 3
Dinner ended in a whirlwind of frustration. 

As they drove home, Stanley focused intently on the road, his demeanor icy and detached. Meanwhile, Rebecca gazed out the window, a profound emptiness pooling in her chest.

Then came the sudden screech of brakes. They both looked up at the same time and saw a car speeding out of control into their lane.

Before Rebecca could react, there was a deafening crash. The car lurched violently, and everything in her surroundings began to whirl chaotically.

Her head slammed hard against the window, and everything went black. She was on the verge of losing consciousness.

She heard Stanley's ragged breathing beside her. Forcing her eyes open, she saw his arm stretched out in front of her, as if shielding her.

But in the very next second, her heart turned cold. 

Stanley wasn't protecting her. Instead, he was shielding the ruby pendant lying next to her, the one Mia had gifted him.

At that moment, the ruby pendant was stained with blood, but Stanley seemed oblivious to his own injuries. All he cared about was gently wiping the dirt from its surface.

A faint crack had appeared on the stone. A flicker of pain crossed his eyes. Without hesitation, he pulled out his phone and dialed a number.

"Get in touch with the best restoration expert right away. I need a ruby pendant repaired."

Rebecca looked at him, overwhelmed by sadness. She was bloodied and gravely injured, barely able to move as she sat in the passenger seat. Yet, he didn't cast a single glance her way.

He didn't care about her injuries. He hadn't even called for help. Instead, he had stumbled out of the car, clutching the ruby pendant. He was desperate to have it repaired.

Her consciousness faded, and the world around her dimmed. Just before she lost consciousness, she saw Stanley walking away.

In the operating room, harsh lights shone down on Rebecca's pale face. Her consciousness drifted in and out, fading between clarity and haze.

She could hear the anxious voices of the nurses. "We can't reach her husband. There's no one to sign the consent form for surgery!"

"She's this badly injured, and her husband's just… gone? He didn't even show up? What kind of man doesn't even stop by to sign the papers? What could possibly be more important than a life?"

A faint, bitter smile tugged at the corner of Rebecca's lips. In Stanley's eyes, his first love and the gift she left behind would always matter more than her life.

"I can… sign it myself…" she murmured weakly, her voice barely audible.

The nurse froze for a moment, clearly hesitant. But with no other option, she eventually agreed.

Rebecca lifted her bloodstained hand and, with trembling strokes, signed the surgical consent form. Every letter felt like it drained the last of her strength.

She didn't know how much time had passed. When she opened her eyes again, she was already lying in a ward.

For several days in a row, Stanley didn't come to see her. She knew he was busy with the ruby pendant. He was too occupied to spare a moment for her.

On the day she was discharged, her injuries still hadn't fully healed. Hence, she could only leave the hospital in a wheelchair.

It seemed Stanley had finally, belatedly, remembered that his wife had been seriously injured in that car accident too. He came to pick her up from the hospital, his expression indifferent, as if it were just another task on his to-do list.

The driver took a shortcut, and the car merged onto the bypass highway. The car was silent, save for the rhythmic tapping of Stanley's fingers on the keyboard.

Rebecca turned her head and saw his screen containing a chat with his secretary about the progress of restoring the ruby pendant. 

He treated the ruby pendant Mia casually gave him as a priceless treasure, while Rebecca, alive by his side, couldn't even catch his eye.

The car cruised steadily along the highway, the scenery outside flashing by in a blur. Neither of them spoke a word.

Suddenly, Stanley's typing came to an abrupt halt. His eyes locked onto something outside the window. 

His breathing quickened, and his fingers clenched the car door tightly, as if he'd just glimpsed something he couldn't tear his eyes away from.

Rebecca followed his gaze. In the crowd, a figure had just passed by. It was a woman in a white dress with softly curled hair. From behind, she looked strikingly like Mia.

"Stop the car!" Stanley's voice rose sharply, cutting through the silence.

The driver slammed the brakes, and the car screeched to a halt by the roadside. Stanley threw the door open the moment the car stopped, his eyes still fixed on that distant figure.

He glanced back at Rebecca, his tone icy and hurried. "Go home on your own. I have something to take care of."

Rebecca was stunned, her fingers gripping the armrests of the wheelchair so tightly that her knuckles turned white. She tried to speak, but before she could say anything, Stanley had pulled her and her wheelchair out of the car.

Then he barked an order at the driver to turn around. The car spun around and drove off in the direction of the disappearing figure, leaving her completely alone in her wheelchair on the side of the highway.

Chapter 4
Rain began to fall unexpectedly. 

Heavy droplets hit Rebecca, cold and biting. Her wounds were still unhealed, and the rain soaked through the bandages, sending waves of searing pain through her with every drop.

She struggled to move the wheelchair away from the roadside, but it was impossible to flag down a cab on the highway. Her fingers were numb from the cold rain, and the wheels slipped on the wet pavement, almost tipping over several times.

At last, as she reached a curve, the wheelchair lost its balance and crashed hard onto the ground.

Rebecca's knee slammed against the cold concrete, tearing open her wound. Blood trickled down her calf, mixing with the rain and staining the ground red.

She gritted her teeth, enduring the pain as she tried to stand, but her body was too weak. She struggled repeatedly, only to fall each time.

The rain poured down harder, blurring her vision until she could no longer tell whether it was rain or tears streaming down her face. Lying there on the cold, wet ground, an overwhelming sorrow welled up inside her.

All it took was a passing glimpse of someone who barely resembled Mia, and he had left her without hesitation. Back then, she was truly too foolish to believe that he would fall for her.

A bitter smile crept across Rebecca's face, and before she realized it, tears began to flow down her cheeks. She lost track of time as she struggled to pull herself up, gradually inching her way back into her wheelchair.

Her clothes were soaked through, and the rain had left her wounds discoloured and raw. The pain was so intense that it nearly numbed her. Yet, she clenched her jaw and slowly started to maneuver her way back home.

Five hours later, she finally made it home. The maids were shocked into silence by her battered and bruised appearance.

Rebecca ignored their reactions and calmly ordered, "Get me hot water and clean gauze."

At night, Stanley returned. His clothes were a bit wrinkled. He looked exhausted, and there was a hint of disappointment in his eyes.

Rebecca sat on the couch and looked up at him, her voice calm. "You didn't find her?"

"I did. She doesn't look like her."

He didn't even notice the wounds on Rebecca's body, nor did he ask how she'd made it back. His mind was entirely consumed by that silhouette that resembled Mia, as if Rebecca's presence were nothing more than air.

Over the next two days, Stanley left early and came back late, lost in thought while looking at photos of Mia. 

Rebecca observed from a distance. There was no turmoil left in her. Her body was healing, and her determination was growing stronger.

That day, she collected all her belongings—clothes, jewelry, and perfume bought to please Stanley—and stacked them in the courtyard. Then, she lit a brazier and began tossing the items in, one by one.

The flames devoured those remnants of the past, as if burning away the last of her lingering attachments.

Just as the fire was dying down, Stanley arrived home. His expression shifted the moment he saw the glow in the courtyard. He rushed over and kicked the brazier with full force.

Embers scattered in all directions. A few landed on Rebecca, searing her skin and drawing a sharp hiss of pain from her lips.

"Who allowed you to burn Mia's belongings?" Stanley roared, his eyes blazing with fury.

Rebecca looked up, wincing from the pain. "You've got it wrong. I wasn't burning Mia's things. They were mine."

Stanley froze for a moment, then stormed into the study. Only after confirming that Mia's belongings were untouched did he finally breathe a sigh of relief.

He came back and looked at Rebecca, his tone laced with confusion and a hint of suppressed anger. "Why the hell would you burn your own things for no reason?"

Rebecca lowered her head, eyes fixed on the still-glowing embers on the ground, and replied softly, "Because I'm leaving."

Chapter 5
Rebecca's voice was soft, yet it landed like a heavy blow straight to Stanley's chest. But within seconds, he regained his composure. "Leaving? Where are you going this time? Another trip?"

Rebecca was momentarily stunned, then let out a faint, self-mocking smile. 

She had been by his side for so many years, and yet it had probably never crossed his mind that she might truly leave him. So when she finally told the truth, his first instinct was to assume she was just going on vacation.

She was about to speak, but Stanley interrupted her. He was indifferent and clearly uninterested in what she had to say. 

"Don't go on any trips right now. It's the seventh anniversary of the day Mia and I met in a few days. I want to host a party. Help me plan it."

Rebecca said nothing more. She simply nodded. "Got it."

For the next several days, she was busy preparing for the party. The event turned out to be lavish and grand. 

Countless gardenias, Mia's favorite, adorned every corner of the venue. Under the dazzling lights, the entire scene felt almost dreamlike.

Amid the clinking of glasses and murmured toasts, the sound of whispered conversations began to reach her ears.

"Mr. Jarrow really is devoted. After all these years, he still can't forget Mia. Even after she's gone, he's throwing a party to mark the day they met. First love's power is truly not something just anyone can compete with."

"No kidding. And his actual wife? She's got some tolerance. I heard she planned this whole event herself. I can't believe she loves him that much. I know I never could."

Rebecca questioned if it was true love, recalling it might have been real once.

She was just about to reach for a pastry when she saw Stanley place an elegantly wrapped gift box in front of Mia's photo. Moments later, a few of his friends walked over.

"Stanley, you really went too far this time. We've all seen how much Rebecca has loved you over the years, but you still can't let go of Mia. Aren't you afraid she might leave you one day?"

Stanley let out a quiet laugh, his voice laced with scornful confidence. "Anyone else might leave me, but not her. She never will."

Rebecca's fingers trembled slightly, sending a ripple through the wine in her glass. She lowered her head, a bitter smile tugging at the corner of her lips. 

She thought, "Stanley, this time, you couldn't be more wrong."

After the party, the two saw flames roaring from the villa as soon as they reached the gate. The fire spread rapidly, sending thick smoke into the sky and illuminating the night.

Stanley's face went pale in an instant. He flung the car door open and bolted toward the burning house without a second thought.

Rebecca instinctively grabbed his arm. "Are you out of your mind? Wait for the firefighters!"

But Stanley shoved her away, madness flickering in his eyes. "If we wait, all of Mia's things will be gone!"

Rebecca stumbled backward from the force of his push, falling hard to the ground. Her knee struck the cold pavement, splitting open her old wound as fresh blood trickled down her calf.

She looked up and watched him rush into the flames. "They're just things. Are they really worth more than your life?"

Stanley paused briefly but didn't turn around. His voice was icy and determined. "Yes. She's gone. And what she left behind… is my life."

Rebecca watched Stanley vanish into the flames, then let out a low, bitter laugh. She didn't try to stop him anymore.

The flames grew fiercer, the thick smoke nearly suffocating. Stanley's figure flickered in the firelight as he desperately salvaged anything connected to Mia, as if those items were more important than his own life.

At last, he burst out of the inferno, cradling a bundle of items. His clothes were tattered from the flames, his body covered in burns and bruises, yet he held those items as if they were treasures.

In his eyes was a flicker of satisfaction, as though he had just fulfilled some sacred mission.


Chapter 6
By the time the ambulance arrived, Stanley had already fainted.

A nurse glanced at Rebecca and asked, "Miss, aren't you going with him?"

Rebecca shook her head and replied calmly, "That won't be necessary."

She didn't go to the hospital, nor did she ask about Stanley's condition. Instead, she quietly packed her luggage.

Then, she went to Mistlake Villa. Nadia opened the door to greet her. 

For a moment, Rebecca froze. Nadia wore a white dress, her long hair softly curled, and her eyes were gentle. She looked almost exactly like the Mia from Rebecca's memories.

"Rebecca, looks like I've gotten pretty good at it," Nadia said tenderly with a smile.

Rebecca nodded, a faint trace of approval in her tone. "You've done well. But there's just one thing left to work on—the way you look at people and how you speak. 

"Mia came from a wealthy family. Her gaze was never timid or overly cautious. You can be a bit more confident. And her soft voice… that was because she was frail and often sick..."

For three days straight, Rebecca stayed at Mistlake Villa, coaching Nadia in detail. She had Nadia recite Mia's every preference over and over again. She shared every detail and nuance without holding back.

"Nadia, you can ask Stanley for money or power, but don't ask for his heart. It belongs to Mia and only her. No matter how perfectly you imitate her, you're not her."

Nadia nodded obediently. "I understand, Rebecca. All I want is a stable life. I'm not looking for love."

Rebecca felt reassured, offering a comforting smile. "Once I'm gone, as long as you have that face, Stanley will treat you well. You'll never have to worry about being pushed around by your leech of a family again."

After expressing everything she wanted to, Rebecca was about to leave. Just then, Stanley called her, which was unusual.

His voice was aloof and distant. "I've bought a new villa. Move all of Mia's things there and set up the memorial altar. I want everything done by the time I'm out of the hospital."

Rebecca said nothing and quietly took care of everything once again.

When Stanley was discharged and saw the memorial altar neatly arranged, a rare look of satisfaction crossed his face. During dinner, he even served her the dishes, something he hadn't done in years.

But just then, a wave of nausea swept over Rebecca. She stood up abruptly and rushed to the bathroom, where she vomited violently.

Stanley's expression shifted slightly. He waited until she came out, then handed her a glass of milk. "You haven't been feeling well lately, have you? Drink this. Get some rest. You'll feel better after a nap."

Rebecca took the glass of milk, but her gaze lingered on the faint sediment gathered at the bottom. A quiet chill crept through her, sinking deep into her bones.

She suddenly recalled that whenever she had been pregnant before, he would unexpectedly bring her a glass of milk. So that was when he'd slipped her the abortion pills.

And now, he was offering her another glass. He must be thinking she was pregnant again.

She didn't want to drink it, but he forced it down her throat, then said coldly, "Get some rest."

That night, Rebecca was in unbearable pain, drifting in and out of consciousness as waves of agony tore through her.

However, Stanley stood by, watching with detached indifference, unmoved by her suffering. It wasn't until dawn broke that he finally rushed her to the hospital.

After examining her, the doctor frowned and said, "It's just a stomach issue. How could you give her abortion medication for that? She's in the worst of it now after the gastric lavage. Take good care of her."

Yet Stanley didn't stay to care for her. He turned and walked away without a word.

Chapter 7
Three days later, Rebecca left the hospital on her own. Coincidentally, the day of her discharge was also Mia's birthday, as well as her own.

After the birthday cake she ordered was delivered, she made herself a simple plate of pasta. Then, she lit the candles and sang a birthday song to herself before making a wish.

With her eyes closed, she silently wished, "May Stanley and I never meet again."

Just after she made her wish, Stanley came back, reeking of alcohol. When he saw the birthday cake and candles on the table, he was visibly upset.

He stormed over, grabbed the cake, and threw it on the floor. Then he swept the food off the table.

"Rebecca, didn't I tell you you're not allowed to celebrate your birthday on this day? Mia will never have another birthday again, and you still insist on celebrating to spite me!"

Rebecca looked at him calmly, her voice utterly steady. "So Mia's gone, and we happened to be born on the same day. Does that mean I've lost the right to celebrate my birthday for the rest of my life?"

Stanley paused for a second, then replied coldly, "Mia's not even in this world anymore. What difference does it make if you give up a little for her?"

Rebecca was stunned. Then, suddenly, she laughed.

When she looked up again, there were tears in her eyes. "I understand now, Stanley. From now on, I'll never celebrate my birthday in front of you again."

After that, Stanley remained angry and never came home again.

Every day, Rebecca would catch glimpses of Stanley's life through his secretary, Jarvis Miller's, social media. Stanley continued to obsessively search for a replacement for Mia, but he never found one.

She patiently waited until the mandatory divorce cooling-off period was over. At last, she was free to leave.

That day, Rebecca went to the courthouse alone and picked up the divorce certificate.

When she got home, she found Stanley passed out on the couch, drunk and mumbling Mia's name. "Mia… Mia…"

Rebecca glanced at him, then quietly placed his copy of the divorce certificate on the table. After that, she made a phone call and asked Nadia to come over.

Outside the door, Nadia looked uneasy, nervously gripping Rebecca's hand. "Rebecca, I'm worried I won't be able to pull it off."

Rebecca patted her hand. "Don't worry. Just walk in and tell him you're Mia. Tell him you've come back to life. He'll believe you. As long as you have that face, he'll treat you well for the rest of your life."

Her face was her ultimate advantage.

Nadia hesitated. "What if… what if he asks about you? What should I say? That you left, or…"

Rebecca was indifferent. "He won't ask about me. And if he does, just tell him I'm dead."

With that, she gave Nadia a hug and gently pushed her through the door. Then Rebecca picked up her luggage, closed the door behind her, and hailed a cab.

"Where to, miss?" 

She smiled, her voice lighter than it had been in a long time. "The airport."
