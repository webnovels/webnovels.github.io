Putting down my phone, I turned, flowers in hand, and headed straight for the airport, completely forgetting about Savannah’s instructions.

It wasn't until late that night, when Savannah hadn't received the cake I was supposed to make, ruining the elaborate birthday party she’d planned for Ryder, that she laid all the blame on me.

She stormed in, Ryder following behind her. She kicked the door open, screaming,

“Caleb, how many times is this?! What kind of stunt are you pulling now?! Where’s the cake I told you to make?!”

I glanced at the rattling door, answering blandly, “Forgot.”

Savannah immediately blew up. The thought of Ryder being openly ridiculed because I hadn’t shown up with the cake enraged her.

 She lunged forward, slapping me twice, and snarled,

“Do you have any idea that because of you, Ryder was utterly humiliated in front of everyone?! People were pointing and whispering about him! And he was even worried about you, telling me not to get mad at you!”

“Ryder is such a good person, why would you do this to him?!”

“I’m giving you half an hour! You have to make a cake to apologize within that time, or I’m not done with you!”

With that, she slammed the door and left.

 Watching her resolute back, I realized that she’d never been this invested, not even for my own birthdays. 

Not only did I never get the special treatment a birthday person deserved, but I had to make *her* a cake, and if it wasn’t to her liking, I’d have to stand all night as punishment. 

Thinking of this, I let out a bitter laugh.

As I stepped out of my room, I saw her sitting in the living room, carefully peeling an orange for Ryder, meticulously removing all the white pith before handing it to him. 

Ryder saw me but didn’t make a sound. Instead, he smugly took the orange from Savannah and ate it.

“Savannah, let’s set our wedding for three days from now, okay?” 

Ryder asked, his eyes gleaming triumphantly at me, though his voice was tender as he spoke to Savannah.

Savannah had her back to me, but her voice was doting. “Of course, darling. Whatever you say.”

Hearing that, he smiled even more triumphantly, then asked again:

“How about inviting Caleb to our wedding, too?”

This time, Savannah didn’t answer directly. Ryder saw the hesitation on her face and immediately acted hurt. 

“I just want his blessing. That way, our wedding will be even more perfect. Didn’t you always say you wanted to give me a perfect wedding?”

Savannah was silent after hearing this. Then, as if remembering something, she nodded in agreement. Ryder smirked, looking at me. 

“Caleb, did you hear that? Savannah and I are cordially inviting you to our wedding.”

Then Savannah turned back, her face cold. Seeing me, her eyes seemed to falter for a moment before she said with disdain, “Since you heard it, I won’t repeat myself. Be there on time, don’t make us a laughingstock again.”

My hand clenched. I met Savannah’s indifferent gaze. My eight years of devotion, and in the end, I didn’t even get a proper breakup. I scoffed at myself, then nodded in agreement.

On the wedding day, I showed up in full formal wear. The moment the couple emerged, they were the center of attention. 

Guests showered them with compliments, calling them a match made in heaven, not holding back on their praises. 

Savannah accepted it all with a beaming smile, but when her eyes landed on me, the smile instantly vanished.

Savannah’s face soured. She frowned and chastised me, “Caleb, are you trying to steal Ryder’s thunder dressed like that? Don’t forget, today is Ryder’s and my wedding. Ryder is the groom today!”

“If I’d known this, I never should have agreed to let you come! I thought you’d know your place, but I never imagined you’d stoop so low just to cause trouble!”

At her words, the surrounding guests began to whisper. Those who didn’t know me accused me of being shameless; those who did threatened to kick me out.

 Ryder, on the other hand, didn’t seem annoyed. He even spoke up for me, sounding understanding. 

“Savannah, if he wants to be my best man, then let’s humor him. It’s a way of thanking him for taking care of you all these years. And it wouldn’t be a waste of that outfit he’s wearing today.”

Ryder looked at me with a challenging glint in his eyes.

 Savannah frowned, about to retort, but then heard the continued whispers around them and relented. She checked the time, clearly reluctant. 

“Then hurry up and get ready. Is this where you’re supposed to be standing?!”

A staff member came over, ready to escort me away, but before I’d taken two steps, Ryder’s voice stopped them.

“Wait. His outfit is actually perfect. How about we have him bring us the wedding rings in a bit?”

My body stiffened at his words. Deliver the rings. That was the flower girl’s job.

 He wanted me to watch them exchange vows, to watch Savannah marry him, with my own eyes? I looked at Savannah. She didn’t speak, implying her silent consent.

The ceremony began quickly. Watching Savannah shed tears on stage, moved by Ryder’s words, I couldn’t help but sneer. The stage was set.

It was time for the real show to begin. Savannah, let’s see how long you can keep that smile.

The next second, the officiant excitedly announced, “Now, let’s give a round of applause for our special guest who will be presenting the rings to the happy couple…”

A thunderous applause erupted. The couple on stage smiled, waiting for me to bring them their rings. 

I hooked a smile on my face, took the ring box from the staff member, and slowly walked forward. 

Whispers filled my ears, but my feet moved step by step, *away* from the altar. A moment later, I turned and knelt on one knee in front of a slender, unfamiliar woman.

The entire hall erupted in gasps. Savannah’s face went deathly pale as she recognized me, then contorted in a furious scream. 

“Caleb, do you even know what you’re doing?!”


“Of course, I’m proposing. Are you blind? Can’t you tell?” I sneered, utterly dismissive.

Savannah’s face changed drastically. She grabbed her wedding dress with both hands and strode towards me, seething.
