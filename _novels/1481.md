My daughter was sick, so I went to her apartment to take care of her.

The moment I stepped inside, a putrid stench hit me. I offered to clean up her place.

Clara's roommates' faces immediately soured.

"What smell? There's nothing wrong with this apartment!"

"If you think this place is too rundown, then just tell Clara to move out."

Clara impatiently pushed me away too.

"Mom, you came to see me, fine. But don't be so dramatic and embarrass me, okay?"

Was my sense of smell faulty?

But when I went to bed that night, the odor was so strong I couldn't sleep.

Finally, I discovered the stench was coming from my daughter!

I quickly brought her to the shower, scrubbing her several times, but the smell remained incredibly pungent!

I had no choice. I decided to hire professional cleaners and have them disinfect the apartment from top to bottom.

But Clara's roommates felt offended and argued with me.

In the chaos, I was pushed. My temple struck the sharp edge of the coffee table, and I died instantly!

When I opened my eyes again, I was back at the moment I first entered the apartment, and the putrid stench assailed me once more...
