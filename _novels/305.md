"It was my wedding day, and my fiancée's high school sweetheart showed up to ""congratulate"" us. The two of them locked themselves in the bridal suite, claiming they needed to catch up.

I was worried about holding up the ceremony, so I begged Ashley to come out.

She didn't care, yelling through the door that I was a heartless jerk.

""If Ethan hadn't dumped me years ago, you never would have had a chance with me. You should be thanking Ethan for his 'generosity'.""

""Ethan and I share precious memories, and I need to relive them one last time before getting married.""

""We're about to get married anyway. Just think of this as my last bit of freedom before settling down!""

She stubbornly insisted on delaying the wedding by half an hour, making me the laughingstock of my family and friends.

When Ashley refused to open the door, I turned to her best friend, Brooke, who was also the maid of honor.

""Do you want to get married? If you say yes, I'll marry you right now!"""
