Chapter 1
Megan only learned the truth on the brink of death. She had two husbands. One was Caspian Stone, and the other was his twin brother, Cedric Stone.

Both men had been devoted to the fake heiress, Arianna Maxwell. But when the marriage had been pushed onto Megan, the real heiress, the twins had secretly agreed to alternate weeks with her so neither felt shortchanged.

Megan would have lived her entire life in the dark if she hadn't fallen down the stairs and lost the baby. While drifting in and out of consciousness at the hospital, she overheard the three of them talking.

"You two are way too good to me," Arianna said, sounding almost touched. "You planned that fall just because I asked. If she wakes up and realizes she lost her baby after finally getting pregnant, do you think she'll be mad?"

Caspian lounged lazily in his chair, his dark eyes full of mockery. "She never deserved to carry our child. We gave her contraceptives long ago. Who would have thought she'd get this lucky?"

Cedric's eyes flashed with cold indifference. "She kept trying to seduce us, and we only gave in once in a while. I already instructed the doctor to remove her uterus. She'll never have another chance to get pregnant."

Arianna sighed regretfully. "What a shame. I still don't know whether the baby was yours or Caspian's."

It was in that moment that Megan finally understood the horrifying truth. She had unknowingly been their shared wife for seven years.

There was nothing more disgusting or infuriating in the world. Rage tore through her, triggering massive hemorrhaging, and despite the doctors' efforts, she was pronounced dead.

…

When Megan opened her eyes again, she was back on the night of her wedding to Caspian.

He noticed her staring at him strangely and narrowed his eyes. "Why are you looking at me like that?"

Megan recalled what had happened five years ago. After the truth about her and Arianna's identities had come to light, the engagement between the White family and the Stone family had fallen on her shoulders instead.

Since she had been switched at birth, returning to the White family left her completely out of place, even in front of her biological parents. 

The Whites were an elite family, and she was a girl from an orphanage who knew nothing about upper-class etiquette.

She embarrassed herself constantly, and many people looked down on her.

Caspian had always stood by her. When others mocked her, he stepped in front of her protectively. When they sneered at her, he shot back without hesitation.

She was like a delicate bird, drawn to the warmth hidden beneath his icy exterior. So when her parents asked which twin she wanted to marry, she chose Caspian without hesitation.

She never imagined he had only agreed on the surface. In truth, he never wanted her, and over the seven years of their marriage, he took turns sharing her with Cedric.

Megan felt a sharp pain in her chest. She swallowed the bitterness and muttered, "It's nothing."

Caspian gently stroked the top of her head. "Get some rest. I'm going to see Cedric for a bit."

Her heart sank, and her eyes widened in disbelief.

She remembered this moment from her previous life. Did that mean the man who spent her wedding night with her hadn't even been Caspian?

As she watched Caspian walk away, Megan clutched her chest to hold back the pain and quietly followed. Through the crack in the door, she heard him talking to Cedric.

"Tonight's your wedding night, and you're still coming here to switch with me?" Cedric asked, frowning.

"So what? Ari is the only one I love. Besides, the week is up. It's my turn today."

Cedric's frown deepened. "What about your wedding night? Are you seriously expecting me to take your place and sleep with Megan?"

Caspian motioned for Cedric to hand over his clothes and casually said, "Does it matter? Her eyes are damaged. She had drops this morning, and she can't even tell you from me. What difference does it make who sleeps with her?"

"You really are ruthless," Cedric said, handing over his clothes. "First, you staged the car accident to damage Megan's eyes. Then you acted all caring, giving her those daily dilating drops so she couldn't see clearly. Our rotation wouldn't have gone so smoothly otherwise."

"Grandpa made us marry her, then he warned us to treat her well and forbid any divorce. That's the only reason things got this messy," Caspian replied, straightening his collar with annoyance.

Megan's mind spun. The shock was so overwhelming that her body began to tremble.

After getting engaged to Caspian, she had been in a serious car accident that had nearly blinded her. He had never left her side, spending a fortune to develop medicine to restore her sight and personally applying her eye drops every day.

She had been touched by his devotion and had fallen even harder for him, never imagining it was all part of a cruel scheme. Worse, the man she had spent their wedding night with in her previous life hadn't even been him.

How could Caspian do this to her?

She fled the villa and called her senior, Andrew Parker.

"Andrew, I've made up my mind. I want to join you in the war zone and serve as an MSF doctor with the Global Aid Alliance for the next ten years."

Andrew's usually easygoing voice grew serious. "But Meg, didn't you say that you wanted to spend your whole life with Caspian?"

Tears streamed down Megan's face. "I don't love him anymore. Not now. Not ever."

If he didn't love her, then she was done. She refused to play their twisted game any longer.

Andrew sensed something was wrong, but he didn't push. "Okay. I'll wait for you at Lordshire Airport in 15 days."
