Nine years. Nine years of stolen moments and whispered promises, nine years of being the secret behind the closed door.

On my twenty-eighth birthday, my boyfriend of nearly a decade walked into the courthouse and married his high school sweetheart.

I stood before him, the question burning silently in my eyes, but Rhys Caldwell’s expression was perfectly serene.

“Jocelyn’s heart is failing, Anya. The doctors say she has maybe three months, tops.” His voice was low, clinical, and utterly devoid of remorse. “This was her last wish. I couldn’t let her die with that kind of regret.”

Jocelyn Day, his so-called tragic love, leaned against his arm, a triumphant smile playing on her lips.

“I hate heavy moods,” she announced, her voice ringing across the lavish dining room. “Since we’re married, we should celebrate.”

Just like that, with one casual sentence from Jocelyn, the elegant dinner planned for my twenty-eighth birthday instantly became their impromptu wedding reception. My sister, Eliza, and our circle of friends moved through the room, offering rounds of toasts and congratulations.

When it was my turn, I didn't cry. I didn't falter. Meeting Rhys's gaze across the linen-covered table, I raised my glass, my face deliberately blank.

“Here’s to the happy couple,” I said, my voice cutting through the expectant silence. “May the bitch and the dog live happily ever after.”

1

The entire room went still. Every eye in the place drilled into me.

Rhys’s knuckles were white where he gripped his champagne flute. He patted the empty seat beside him, a gesture that was both dismissive and familiar.

“Don’t make a scene, Anya. Come and sit down.”

That seat, right next to him, had been my exclusive spot for nearly a decade. Now, he expected me to share it with Jocelyn.

I ignored him. I walked straight to the other side of the table and sat down next to Eliza.

The warmth drained from Rhys’s eyes, replaced by a sudden, dangerous chill.

Eliza laughed, trying to smooth over the tension. “Rhys, darling, we all know you treat Anya like your little sister, but you’re a married man now. Watch the boundaries. We wouldn’t want Jocelyn to get the wrong idea.”

Jocelyn tightened her grip on his arm, the picture of a devoted, fragile bride.

Rhys gave a low chuckle. “I’m just doing this to give Jocelyn peace of mind. This marriage will be dissolved in three months, naturally.” He looked pointedly at me. “Besides, if I had ever intended to marry Anya, why would I have waited until now?”

The friends at the table chimed in, eager to back him up.

“He was wrecked when Jocelyn went overseas for grad school. Wrecked for almost a year.”

“The most eligible bachelor in the city, and all he did was hang out with us. Never brought a date.”

“True. Last time Rhys got drunk, he admitted he was waiting for Jocelyn. We all heard it. Everyone here is a witness.”

The chatter swirled around me. I kept my head down, slowly sipping my wine, but my chest felt like it was being beaten with a blunt instrument—a heavy, suffocating ache.

I had been with Rhys since I was nineteen.

When I was twenty-three, I asked him to make us public. He said Eliza was his most important business partner, and an announcement could impact the company’s stock and external perception. He didn't think I could handle the pressure.

When I turned twenty-seven, he promised that if we were still together when I turned twenty-eight, we would finally announce our relationship.

Today was my twenty-eighth birthday.

And he was legally married to Jocelyn Day.

Jocelyn gave me a sickly sweet smile. “Anya, even though Rhys and I bicker, we are legally husband and wife now. I’m sure Rhys has given you plenty of gifts over the years for your birthdays. Shouldn’t you give us a gift in return? I’ve actually been admiring the ring on your finger. Could you give it to me?”

My fingers unconsciously clenched, and my breath hitched.

That ring was the token he had given me on my nineteenth birthday—the night he first told me he loved me. I hadn't taken it off in nine years.

Eliza, seeing my silence, tried to diffuse the situation. “Anya, you know Rhys has always held a torch for Jocelyn. They’ve missed so much time. Why don’t you be the bigger person?”

I looked at Rhys. He remained silent, saying nothing to defend me or the ring. Not until Jocelyn leaned against him, pressing her head into his chest, her voice a soft, manipulative purr.

“Rhys, I really love it. Could you just buy me an identical one? Then I won’t have any regrets.”

Rhys chuckled softly and pulled her tighter. “Don’t be silly. It’s just a piece of jewelry, not some rare artifact.” He looked at me, his gaze now cold. “Anya, since your sister-in-law likes it so much, just give it to her.”

I was numb.

Since I was nineteen, I had followed him without a title, a shadow lover. I spent nine years trying to fit his mold—I swapped my comfortable casual wear for the tight, sophisticated clothes he admired. I maintained the secret because he loved the novelty of a forbidden affair.

But in that moment, I understood. My nine years of devotion meant less than dust in his estimation.

Jocelyn basked in Rhys’s indulgence, and as the table roared with drunken cheers, she kissed him on the mouth.

I didn't yell. I didn't break down. I quietly slipped the ring off my finger and placed it on the edge of the table.

“Mr. Caldwell is right,” I said, meeting his eyes. “It’s not worth much. If the sister-in-law wants it, she can have it.”

Rhys stared at me, his eyes now blazing with controlled fury.

Jocelyn gasped, enjoying the attention. Rhys loosened his jaw, giving a cold smile. “Since Anya is being so generous, Jocelyn, you should take it.”

Jocelyn picked up the ring, examined it for a moment, and her lip curled in distaste. “The setting is only mediocre, not nearly as nice as the ones you bought me.”

With a shrug, she tossed the diamond to a passing waiter who was clearing the bone plates.

“Lucky you,” she drawled. “Should fetch a decent bit of cash.”

I watched the ring roll to a stop beside a smear of food. My blood instantly froze in my veins.

Rhys looked at my ashen face, his voice chilling. “Why are you still standing there? We are celebrating my marriage tonight. Everyone stays until the end and everyone is going to enjoy themselves. No one is leaving early.”

My face was transparent with shock and pain. “No need. You all have fun. I have other plans.”

As the words left my mouth, Rhys’s face darkened completely.

I ignored him, turned on my heel, and walked out of the banquet hall.

Back in my apartment building’s underground garage, the notification bar on my phone remained silent. Rhys didn’t send a single word of explanation.

But he had updated his social media.

I tapped the screen.

The video showed him and Jocelyn playing a blindfolded grape-feeding game, which quickly turned into a passionate, staged kiss amidst the cheers. As their lips intertwined, everyone in the video was lamenting the nine lost years Jocelyn and Rhys had missed.

No one spared a thought for Anya Wells, the woman hidden for nine years.

In the video, Jocelyn’s cheeks were flushed, and she delicately kissed his jawline. Rhys didn’t pull away. His eyes held that look—a familiar, nearly frantic devotion—the look he used to give me when he was overwhelmed by desire.

Now it belonged to Jocelyn.

Rhys, if this is your answer, then I release you.

I forced a humorless twist to my lips. Then, I tapped the 'like' button on his post.

After that, I began systematically clearing the apartment of every trace of my existence.

I had pleaded with Rhys to go public countless times. I’d charmed him, argued with him, and even blurredly questioned him in the throes of our most intimate moments: When can we finally be open?

He always had an excuse.

Until Jocelyn appeared. He introduced her to every friend, told everyone to call her his wife, and married her publicly.

In this moment, I was entirely lucid. He wasn't avoiding public commitment. He was avoiding public commitment to me.

After packing my last box, I drove back to my own home.

As soon as I stepped inside, my parents, who were traveling overseas, called me via video chat.

“Anya, do you remember Leo Harrington, the boy who used to always look out for you when you were little? He’s back in the States running the family business. You should find time to meet up.”

During my years with Rhys, my parents had tried to introduce me to numerous eligible young men. They only needed me to agree. Each time, I refused.

I was twenty-eight years old. It wasn't too late to start a new life.

Under their hopeful, cautious gaze, I didn’t refuse this time.

“Yes,” I said.

Shortly after, I submitted my resignation to the group’s Human Resources Department.

Because I had been so deeply in love with Rhys, I joined his corporation right after graduation, starting as an assistant. To help him through difficult periods, I’d pull all-nighters analyzing data, reviewing case studies, and revising proposals. I lost almost twenty pounds during one major push. Rhys had been full of sympathy, sending nutritional meals from his personal chef directly to my desk. Even though our relationship was a secret, his care for me had never been disguised.

That special attention would now belong entirely to Jocelyn.

Not long after the email was sent, Rhys called.

When I answered, there was a dead silence on the line. In the past, no matter who called whom, I was always the one to initiate the conversation. This time, I didn't have the strength to utter a single word.

Just as I thought he wouldn’t speak and I prepared to hang up, his voice—tight with irritation—came through.

“Anya Wells, what exactly do you think you’re doing? Liking a post, then submitting your resignation? You can’t wait three months?” His voice hardened. “Don’t you worry that I might actually leave you?”

I used to be terrified of that. Absolutely terrified. That’s why I was always compliant and agreeable in his presence.

I didn't want to pretend anymore.

“Rhys,” I said quietly. “Let’s just end it.”

The day after I suggested we break up, I received notification that my resignation had been approved. The HR tone was strictly business. I was required to complete my handover immediately and was not allowed to set foot in the group headquarters after today.

Clearly, Rhys was truly enraged this time.

As I walked through the departments, I heard the inevitable whispers.

“The only reason Mr. Caldwell paid attention to her was because of Eliza, the CEO. She really thought she was going to move up, but look at her now—running off with her tail between her legs.”

“So what if the CEO indulged her before? She embarrassed the actual Mrs. Caldwell yesterday. She deserves to be cleaned out.”

I ignored the ridicule, calmly processing the paperwork. Once the final stamp fell, I would be done with Rhys Caldwell.

“Wait a minute.”

Rhys’s cold voice came from behind me. Jocelyn was hanging on his arm, giving me a look of undisguised challenge.

“The core documents for this morning’s bid were leaked. I heard Ms. Wells here was responsible for those files,” Jocelyn said.

I turned to Rhys. “Are you accusing me?”

“We’ll know soon enough,” he said, his face impassive. “A quick check of your work terminal will clarify everything.”

Rhys gave a brief nod. Immediately, two people from the Group’s Tech Department swarmed my desk.

This was a public conviction without a trial.

I had spent several sleepless nights developing those bid documents. And now, Rhys was questioning my loyalty.

“Don’t touch my machine!”

They weren’t just checking the current files; they were attempting to recover deleted data. If they succeeded, all the intimate photos I had deleted, and the history of my relationship with Rhys, would be exposed.

Security guards held me back. I couldn't reach my desk.

“Rhys, tell them to stop. I had nothing to do with the leak.”

Rhys clamped his hand tightly around my wrist, his face a mask of iron. “Are you sure it wasn’t you?”

The murmurs grew louder around us.

“It has to be Anya Wells. Why else would she freak out?”

“Maybe she’s doing this out of spite. She couldn't have the CEO, so she leaked the documents to a rival. That's cold.”

Rhys cut them off with a chilling command. “Silence. Are the files recovered?”

“They are!”

I spun around. “Don’t open them, Rhys!”

Rhys’s grip tightened on my wrist. “Open them.”

The intimate photos—hundreds of them—flashed across the monitor screen, stripping away my last vestige of privacy. The overwhelming sense of humiliation threatened to break me entirely.

Rhys’s expression was unreadable for a long moment.

Then, he smiled. He began scrolling through the photos, one after the other.

“Anya Wells, do you have some kind of delusion?” he said, his voice laced with mocking disbelief. “Where did you find all these pictures? Did you Photoshop my face onto someone else’s body?”

At his words, a wave of sneering laughter erupted from the onlookers.

The humiliation was a physical force, drowning me.

He married Jocelyn in secret; I endured it. My birthday dinner became their reception; I accepted it. But I never imagined he would publicly trample my dignity like this.

Jocelyn gave a mocking, triumphant smile. “Anya, do you have a crush on Rhys? If you just admit it, I can lend him to you for a few days.”

Rhys frowned in annoyance. “Stop playing along with Anya’s drama, Jocelyn. Everyone knows I see Anya as a little sister. If you like those pictures so much, I can have the tech guys make you a few with my face and yours.”

He was punishing me for leaving by deliberately and publicly denying our entire history. Each word was a tiny, sharp needle pressing into my heart.

I squeezed my palms so hard the pain was blinding, determined not to let a single tear fall.

Jocelyn looked satisfied. “Rhys, you shouldn’t hurt a girl’s feelings like that. At least let her save face. What if she runs away, like I did years ago? You’ll have a hard time winning her back.”

Rhys scoffed, not believing I had the guts to leave permanently. “Where would she go? She’s either following Eliza or following me. She’s throwing a tantrum. In three days, she’ll be begging me to let her come back.”

In the past, our cold wars never lasted more than forty-eight hours. I always gave in first. I always came back to him.

But the Anya Wells standing here now no longer loved him. How long would it take him to realize that?

I was growing numb to the surrounding laughter. When the tech team withdrew, I looked directly at Rhys.

“Mr. Caldwell, since it’s proven the leak had nothing to do with me, shouldn’t you apologize?”

A chorus of condemnation immediately rose up.

“Is she crazy? Asking the CEO for an apology? Who does she think she is?”

“She should be grateful he’s letting her walk away. Just because they didn't find evidence doesn’t mean she wasn’t guilty.”

Rhys frowned, his impatience obvious. “I was following company protocol by checking your equipment before you resigned. You want an apology for that? Anya Wells, are you mad, or am I?”

My voice was terrifyingly calm. “There were hundreds of photos on that terminal. You know exactly where they came from. Nine years, Rhys. Is a simple apology for the public humiliation too much to ask?”

A flicker of something complicated—pain, perhaps—crossed Rhys’s eyes.

Jocelyn, ever the martyr, walked toward me, her smile gentle. “It was thoughtless of us, Anya. If you’re truly offended, I’ll apologize on Rhys’s behalf.”

Then, she suddenly began to gasp for air, clutching her chest.

Rhys’s expression tightened instantly. He rushed to support her, his voice a furious snarl. “Apologize for what? This has nothing to do with you. Where does it hurt?”

He glared at me, as if I were a terrible criminal. “Anya Wells, you can take your anger out on me, but she is a sick person. Why are you intentionally provoking her?”

Jocelyn shook her head weakly. “I’m fine. She’s young. I’ll just explain things to her clearly.”

She gently pulled away from Rhys and moved toward me. I instantly caught the flash of triumph in her eyes. Before I could even react, she dropped backward and sat heavily on the floor.

The room fell silent. Everyone saw that she had fallen on her own.

Everyone, except Rhys.

He rushed toward me like a maniac and shoved me hard. I stumbled, slamming my hip into the metal filing cabinet behind me. A sharp, twisting cramp erupted in my lower abdomen, and my face went instantly white.

But Rhys didn't even spare me a glance.

“Anya Wells,” he spat, already focused on Jocelyn. “You better pray Jocelyn is alright, or I swear I will make you wish you were dead.”

The man I had loved for nine years, threatening to make me wish I was dead for the sake of a liar. The last spark of light in my heart extinguished entirely.

Then, an astonished cry broke out in the crowd.

I reached down and found my hand covered in a warm, slick wetness. Blood was soaking through my clothes.

Before I lost consciousness, Eliza—my strong, beautiful sister—screamed, her arms shaking as she caught me.

“Don’t be afraid, Anya. I’m here.”

After rushing Jocelyn to the emergency room, Rhys received a phone call from my sister. Eliza’s voice, a scream of pure rage he’d never heard, echoed in the silent hall.

“Rhys Caldwell, are you a monster? I will deal with you later!”

“Right now, you get over here. Anya miscarried.”
