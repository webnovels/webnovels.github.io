The master bedroom had only one large bed.

The room's decor was minimalist, with a simple black, white, and gray color scheme.

Apart from that, the room was kept immaculately clean, with a faint scent of gardenia wafting through the air.

I remembered that this was a fragrance I liked.

I walked to the walk-in closet, hoping to find some of my pajamas, but all I saw was a sea of black clothing.

...

With no other option, I knocked on the study door.

"Honey, I'm sorry to bother you," I said, trying to sound as respectful as possible.

Aria, who was working at her computer, looked up at me.

"Do you know where my pajamas are? I looked in the master bedroom closet but couldn't find any."

Aria stared at me for a few seconds without saying anything.

Just as I thought she wasn't going to answer and was about to leave, she suddenly stood up from her chair and walked towards me.

Aria smirked, hands in her pockets.

"What, are you planning to keep up this amnesia act?"

I swallowed hard, not knowing what to say. The problem was, even if I told the truth, she wouldn't believe me.

Fortunately, she didn't press the issue this time and walked past me towards another room.

I stood there, unsure of what to do.

She glanced back at me. "Aren't you coming?"

I immediately followed her like an obedient puppy, making sure to keep a respectful distance.

"Thank you."

Two minutes later, when I happily opened the closet door to get my pajamas, I immediately slammed it shut.

My face turned bright red.

It was too embarrassing to look at!

"This is..."

I didn't finish my sentence, but I was sure Aria understood.

She was leaning against the doorframe with her arms crossed, silently watching me.

Her eyes seemed to say, "Go ahead and keep pretending. I'll just watch without saying a word."

...

I took a deep breath and slowly opened the closet door again. The clothing style inside was so revealing that I could hardly believe it.

The worst part was that Aria was still standing there, showing no intention of leaving.

I tried my best to ignore her gaze. With my back to her, I rummaged through the clothes from top to bottom, unable to find a single "normal" piece of clothing.

...

I sighed inwardly, turned around, and not knowing what came over me, I asked Aria,

"Honey, which one do you... prefer me to wear?"

Then, I clearly saw Aria's eyes darken.

She scoffed and walked out, slamming the door shut behind her so hard it made me jump.

Why did she get angry?

As I took my pajamas to the bathroom, a thought suddenly occurred to me. Could our impending divorce be due to problems in our intimate life?

After showering, I put on a robe and went to Coco's nursery.

The nursery was decorated warmly, showing that Aria cared a lot about the child.

I tiptoed in. Coco was already in a sweet dream, hugging a stuffed animal.

I gently tucked the kicked-off blanket back around her and carefully removed her thumb from her mouth, wiping it with a tissue.

It was at this moment that I truly felt like a father.

But I only knew her name was Coco; I didn't even know how old she was.

I looked at my marriage certificate with Aria. The date was four years ago.

So Coco must be around three years old.

I stroked her head and then left her room. As soon as I closed the door and turned around, I saw Aria standing in front of me.

My heart started racing so fast I thought it might jump out of my throat.

"Are you done?" she asked.

"Yes," I replied.

The atmosphere was awkward, and I didn't know what to say.

"So... are you going to bed?" I asked.

Aria didn't respond or make any move.

"I'll go to sleep then," I said, and quickly escaped to the master bedroom.

Without another word, I lifted the covers and lay down, keeping myself as still as possible.

Not long after, the bedroom door opened, and Aria walked in.

Seeing me lying in bed, she paused for a moment, her footsteps stopping as she just stood there looking at me.

Her gaze made my scalp tingle.

"Honey, which side do you usually sleep on?" I asked.

She didn't answer.

I was starting to feel that Aria's personality had become quite strange in the years I couldn't remember.

She always liked to stare at people coldly without saying a word. I forced a smile and got out of bed.

"You choose first," I said.

Petty Aria! I cursed her in my mind, knowing she couldn't hear my thoughts.

But this time, she moved.

She walked to the other side of the bed, lay down, and ignored me, turning off the bedside lamp with a sharp click.

I...

I fumbled in the dark, getting back under the covers. The person beside me was breathing evenly.

Everything around was quiet, but I couldn't sleep at all.

I couldn't even think straight; my mind was a jumbled mess.

But I could feel that she was very close to me, so close that our breaths seemed to mingle silently in the air between us.

"Honey, are you still awake?" I asked softly.

"What do you want?" she replied.

"What?"

"You were the one who wanted to get married, and you were the one who went to great lengths to get a divorce. Now you're lying here with me, trying to seduce me. Liam, I don't have time to play your games. If you want something, just say it."

"Seduce?" I stared at her with wide eyes, suddenly feeling a chill run through my chest.

I looked down and realized how revealing the outfit I was wearing actually was.

No wonder Aria thought my current behavior was an attempt to seduce her.

"I... I didn't mean it that way. I'm sorry," I stammered.

But Aria clearly didn't want to continue sharing a bed with me.

She got up and left the bedroom, leaving me with these parting words:

"Liam, I don't care what you're thinking right now. I have no feelings left for you. I hope you understand that. Whether you're pretending to have amnesia or trying to seduce me, it doesn't matter to me anymore."

"I'll sleep in the guest room tonight. Do whatever you want."

Aria left.

In the vast space of the bedroom, I was left alone with nothing but my sorrow.
