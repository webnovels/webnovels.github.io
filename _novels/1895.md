I am a Beta, but I have a childhood sweetheart who is a top-tier Omega.

He is a federal politician; I am a house husband.

Everyone says our marriage is a joke, but I never thought so.

Until the federal election. My husband's rival is a Federal General, a top-tier Alpha, young and highly decorated.

This Alpha somehow took an interest in me.

And my Omega husband, using our past as leverage, personally delivered me to that Alpha's bed.

Later, I signed the divorce papers and left with nothing.

The arrogant Omega then begged me like a madman to remarry him.

1
"Elian, just this once! Help me one last time."

The Omega hugged me tightly.

His beautiful face was written with pleading and pitifulness.

I didn't speak. The moment I heard Adrian's request, a massive roar echoed in my ears.

Minutes ago, Adrian came home, grabbed my hand, and begged me with red-rimmed eyes.

He begged me to sleep with his election rival, General Silas Vance.

"Sleeping" between adults never means just sleeping.

I found it absurd. I thought he was joking.

Until he stood on his tiptoes, wrapped his arms around my neck, and planted fragmented kisses on the corner of my mouth. I knew he wasn't joking.

He really wanted to send me to another man's bed.

And that man was an Alpha I had never met.

The Omega standing before me felt so strange.

"Impossible," I refused softly.

Adrian's face was covered in tears, still begging bitterly.

"Elian, you know my family has always objected to me marrying a Beta like you. If I win this election and become Mayor, there will be no more gossip."

"Elian, I promise this is the last time. Besides, Silas is a top Alpha, he might not even be interested in you... Please, Elian."

Those deliberately gentle tones were what I longed for in my dreams.

But now, they pierced into my body like fiberglass shards.

Invisible, but hurting everywhere.

I remained silent.

Adrian understood my attitude.

The gentleness in his eyes dissipated, restoring the high and mighty posture he usually held before me.

"Elian, the Lin family adopted you at sixteen. We funded your education and supported your grandmother who was in a vegetative state."

"At twenty, ignoring everyone's opposition, I insisted on marrying you, a Beta with nothing."

When saying these words, Adrian's face was frighteningly cold.

He slowly took off the diamond ring on his hand and tossed it onto the table.

The diamond clashed with the marble, making a crisp sound.

My heart was slowly squeezed by an invisible hand.

Adrian said, "Elian, what do you have to repay this debt?"

At this moment, I truly saw the man I had loved for five years.

I always knew my marriage with Adrian wasn't equal.

A top Omega of the Lin family and a penniless Beta.

No one favored this marriage.

But I refused to believe it. I persisted in pursuing love.

Even if Adrian was busy with affairs and didn't come home for a month, I didn't care.

Even if the assistant by his side was an Alpha with a 90% match, I didn't care.

No matter what others said, I didn't believe it.

Because Adrian initiated this marriage.

So I didn't believe he didn't love me.

But now I believe it.

And I am tired.

I looked at Adrian's familiar yet strange face and nodded: "I agree."

Adrian was stunned, a flash of confusion in his eyes, but it quickly turned into determination.

He always thought everything in the world should follow his will.

Naive and cruel.

I rubbed the ring on my finger and said, "There is one condition."

Adrian was in a good mood, lifting his chin to signal me to speak.

I said, "We divorce. I can't do these things while married."

2
Adrian agreed to the divorce swiftly.

On the scale of interests, I am always the losing end.

Adrian took out the documents prepared by his assistant for me to sign.

My mind was a mess. I signed without looking closely.

As the last stroke fell, my heart suddenly emptied.

Watching me finish signing, Adrian suddenly grabbed my hand, placed his face obediently in my palm, and whined coquettishly: "Elian, we'll remarry after the election."

"Didn't you always want a honeymoon to make up for the wedding? We'll go. I'll give you another baby, okay?"

I looked down at Adrian, who was planning on his own, my heart a barren wasteland.

Turns out everything I longed for before was so easily obtained.

I just needed to get into someone else's bed.

I pushed him away and stood up: "Signed. Let me know when the divorce certificate is ready."

This was the first time I rejected Adrian's coquetry.

He was uncomfortable, looking at me helplessly, murmuring: "Elian."

But this time I didn't soften. I turned and left.

Adrian is a supremacist of interest.

The divorce certificate arrived at noon. The hotel room number was sent to me in the evening.

"Elian, today is Silas's rut period. His hotel room is Penthouse 01."

"I'll give you the key card."

Just like that, he couldn't wait to send his lover to another's bed.

The phone screen was glaring.

I turned it off, collapsed on the sofa without any image, and lit a cigarette.

Adrian didn't like the smell of smoke, so I rarely smoked these years.

Adrian cared about face. As his partner, my every move was observed by the outside world.

So I restrained the weariness in my bones, disguising myself as gentle and humble.

This pretense lasted two years.

But now I don't need to pretend anymore.

The smoke rose, blurring my thoughts and the night.

A car honked. I saw Adrian sitting in the driver's seat.

Adrian wore a white suit tonight, looking very gentle, with no trace of the ruthlessness inside.

His eyes brightened as he called me, "Elian, get in."

I sat in the car with the smell of smoke, lazily propping my forehead.

The Omega smelled the smoke and complained coquettishly: "Why are you smoking again? It stinks... it's bad for your health."

I glanced at him faintly: "Drive."

Adrian was so angry his eyes turned red, but in the end, he said nothing.

In the past, he would have pointed at my nose and cursed.

Then turned to seek comfort from his Alpha assistant.

Tsk, I'm being pathetic again.

Head against the window, dense past events rushed at me like the fog of late night.

3
My parents were a Beta-Omega couple. Even though they weren't a match, they were still loving.

When I was five, my mom suffered from pheromone disorder.

The doctor said she needed Alpha pheromones to soothe her, or her body would age rapidly.

But my father was a Beta; he had no pheromones.

He could only buy them on the black market.

But the price was exorbitant.

One bottle cost my father's annual salary.

Expensive, but necessary.

But unexpectedly, that bottle of pheromones contained addictive ingredients.

Without pheromone soothing, my mother would lose her mind, living like a madwoman.

To stop my mother's suffering, my father helplessly went to sell blood and organs to raise money.

In the end, he died on the way home due to excessive blood loss.

And in his arms, he still tightly held a bottle of pheromones.

Initially, Grandma hid the truth from my mom, saying Dad went out to work.

But a neighbor accidentally let it slip.

I still remember that day was beautiful. Mom wore a white dress with a side braid, hugged me and kissed me hard, saying she was going out to buy me ice cream.

She told me to wait at home.

I sat obediently at the door, didn't wait for Mom, but waited for a tearful Grandma.

Grandma said Mom died.

Died in front of Dad's grave.

No one knew how Mom found the cemetery.

No one knew what Mom said to Dad before she died.

No one knew how much despair it took to cut an artery with a stone.

That year I was eight, lost my parents, and depended on Grandma.

At fifteen, Grandma was hit by a car while picking up trash and became a vegetable.

The perpetrator escaped and accidentally fell off a cliff.

Sky-high medical bills pressed on my shoulders like a mountain.

I thought life was dark until my teacher told me the Lin family was looking for a companion to study with young master Lin.

Not only could I study, but food and lodging were included.

I went.

Young master Lin's eyes lit up, he held my hand and said: "I want him."

Since then, my life has been marked with the name Adrian Lin.

Eighteen, to help the Lin family get mining rights, I was forced to drink by clients until my stomach bled.

Nineteen, to save the nearly bankrupt Lin family, I gave up my studies and went down into a collapsed mine to rescue trapped workers.

That time my leg broke, and I stayed in the hospital for three months.

Twenty, Adrian read my diary, learned of my secret crush, and insisted on marrying me.

I was messily happy. Even after being beaten with 120 strokes by Adrian's father, I only said "I listen to the young master."

Twenty-one, Adrian entered politics. He left early and returned late daily. To take care of him, I quit my job to be a house husband.

Now twenty-two, to become Mayor, Adrian chose to send me to an Alpha's bed, even threatening me with past kindness.

Obviously only a few years passed, why did hearts change so fast?

I can't figure it out.

But the only thing clear is that I haven't owed Adrian anything for a long time.

Recollection ended, arrived at the hotel.

I pushed the door open and got out. Adrian stopped me.

"Drink some water. Don't go in smelling like smoke."

I looked at Adrian's consistently drooping puppy eyes and took the bottle.

Drank it in one go, turned to leave.

Adrian called me again, voice careful: "Elian, have you thought about where we'll go for our honeymoon?"

The night wind hit my face.

It hurt.

But far less than one ten-thousandth of what Adrian brought me.

I turned back, looked at the person I loved for five years, voice hoarse: "Adrian, will you regret this?"

The atmosphere solidified.

The plaza clock struck nine times.

As the last sound fell, I heard Adrian say: "Elian, I won't regret it."

4
I curled my lips in self-mockery and turned away.

Adrian called urgently: "Elian, I'll take you up."

I waved my hand: "No need. Relax, I do what I say."

The elevator doors closed, blocking outside prying eyes.

Holding the key card Adrian gave me, I smoothly reached the top floor.

Standing in front of the door, I took a deep breath and pressed the card to the door.

Click, the door opened, heart in my throat.

I lowered my voice, said: "Mr. Vance, hello, Mr. Lin sent me..."

Before I finished, the door was yanked open.

Immediately my wrist tightened, a powerful force pulled me into the room.

The top Alpha's body pressed down like a scorching volcano.

"Mr. Vance!"

Silas Vance's arms imprisoned my waist like iron blocks.

I frowned, impatiently trying to push him away.

The Alpha didn't budge.

At this moment, the genetic advantage of differentiation was vividly displayed.

"Don't move."

The Alpha's hoarse, deep voice rang in my ear.

I clearly felt that the person hugging me tightly now was an Alpha.

A male Alpha capable of doing something to me.

The places touched filled with discomfort.

I frowned trying to dodge, but the Alpha's movements became more excessive.

Cool fingertips stroked my back.

Inch by inch, butterfly bones, spine, ribs, finally landing on the waist dimples.

The weird sensation made me unable to endure anymore, lifting my foot to kick him away.

Suddenly, a heat rush surged from my lower abdomen to my brain.

When I realized something was wrong, it was too late.

My body went limp, the flat nape of my neck began to heat up.

I entered a pseudo-estrus.

It was Adrian. That bottle of water had a problem.

Instantly, my heart fell into an ice cave, even breathing carried sharp pain.

Again. Adrian kicked me into the abyss again.

Hot liquid flowed from the corners of my eyes.

The Alpha paused, reached out and gently wiped it away: "Haven't even done it yet, why cry."

In the dark room, I saw a moment of clarity in the top Alpha's eyes.

I immediately reminded him: "I entered a pseudo-estrus."

Silas pressed his fingertips on the back of my neck. The originally flat nape was now slightly bulging.

I sensed the trembling of the Alpha's fingertips.

A meaningful whimper spilled from my throat.

Even my body trembled slightly along with it.

"Don't... don't touch."

I raised my hand to slap away the wandering hand, but had no strength at all.

The inner desire amplified continuously.

The desire to be filled grew stronger and stronger.

I bit my lower lip hard, making a futile struggle.

Useless.

I gave up.

Through the moonlight outside the window, I saw the Alpha's face clearly.

Thick brows, phoenix eyes, deep gaze, beautifully heart-moving.

My breath hitched.

No one told me this highly decorated young Alpha looked like this.

Silas noticed my gaze, the corners of his mouth curving slightly.

At this moment, only the sound of my heartbeat was in my ears.

Anyway, the situation has reached this point.

Instead of complaining and hating, might as well look on the bright side.

At least this Alpha is very handsome.

I comforted myself with full mockery.

Suppressing the urge to pin him down, I put my hand on Silas's shoulder.

Pressed his body down, planting a light kiss on the corner of his mouth.

After the kiss, I said hoarsely: "Silas Vance."

The Alpha responded: "I'm here."

I said: "Bite me gently."

This sentence was a hint, hot breath stirring the air.

The Alpha chuckled lightly, picked me up, and walked steadily towards the bed.

Simultaneously not forgetting to respond: "Okay."

A light kiss fell on the back of the neck, that piece of flesh was caught by Silas.

Sharp teeth eager for action, then pierced fiercely.

Pain caused mist to unconsciously float in my eyes.

Brain reminded me to run.

Before I could move, I heard the Alpha say softly in my ear like a sigh: "Already very gentle."

At the same time, the tiger's mouth gripped my ankle, easily pulling me back under him.

Pheromones entered my body, domineeringly marking everywhere.

I tried to resist, but faced a top Alpha.

And a top Alpha entering his rut.

I had no strength to fight back.

Pheromone injection ended.

Like a fish out of water, pupils dilated, body shaking, enduring the aftershocks brought by pheromones.

Silas hugged from behind, kisses landing on my shoulder blades.

I heard him say: "Elian, open your mouth to breathe."

I obediently opened my mouth, but didn't expect a trap.

...

A top Alpha's rut lasts seven days.

These seven days I was flipped over and over.

A Beta can't retain pheromones.

But couldn't withstand the marking from inside out.

When Silas's rut ended, I returned to the human world, sleeping exhaustedly for a day and a half.
