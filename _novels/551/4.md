The coffee smell in the break room was so strong it seemed about to overflow. I stirred it with a spoon, took a sip, and felt some acid reflux as I swallowed.

My colleague stared angrily, fuming with indignation.

"How is this fair? She just parachutes in and steals your position? Is this blatant nepotism?"

"Mia, aren't you angry?"

"This position was meant for you. You worked so hard, even almost ended up in the hospital from overworking last time."

Her gaze fell on the dark circles under my eyes: "Mia, I'm telling you, there's no need to work yourself to death like this. Cut back on the coffee."

The warmth of the coffee seeped through the ceramic mug into my hands as I thanked her softly: "Mr. Jiang must have his reasons."

The girl's eyes widened as she was about to complain in a low voice when a phone rang abruptly.

Jake's voice was crystal clear in the small break room, tinged with barely suppressed anger: "Mia, come to my office."

My hand shook, spilling a few drops of coffee on my white shirt. The heat seeped through the fabric, scalding my skin.

I responded quietly: "Okay."
