Jake was my brother.

He had always hated me.

Because I was the culprit who took away his mother.

Over twenty years ago, my mother died in childbirth. As I was born, she lost her life forever on the operating table.

It was a murder disguised as new life.

No one welcomed my arrival.

Because of me, Dad lost his beloved wife.

And Jake lost his mother.

This long-standing resentment began from the day I was born and has continued until now.

I didn't intentionally skip Dad's birthday.

It's just that day, the abdominal pain was so severe I nearly passed out. That's when I first realized something was wrong.

But actually, if I didn't go, he would probably be more at ease.
