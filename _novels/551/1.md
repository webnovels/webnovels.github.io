Jake's call came just as I arrived home.

The diagnosis report in my bag was already crumpled into a ball.

He never used to call me on his own initiative before.

"It was Dad's birthday two days ago," he said, his voice cold as ice.

As always.

"Why didn't you come back..."

"Because I didn't want to," I cut him off. "You went back, didn't you? That's enough."

"Tina came back from abroad at the beginning of the month."

Tina was my uncle's daughter who had lived with us since childhood.

"If she was there, that's fine. After all, you only treat her like a sister anyway."

The person on the other end seemed to suddenly flare up in anger, calling my name in a low voice: "Mia!"

I hung up.

The last bit of sunset glow fell into the room.

I sat at the desk, tearing the diagnosis report into tiny pieces.

As the shreds of paper fluttered down onto the table, my phone screen suddenly lit up.

Jake: Mom's death anniversary is coming up soon.
