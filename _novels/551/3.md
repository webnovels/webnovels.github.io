Jake didn't contact me again.

I was standing outside the company building when I took a deep breath.

After graduation, I had joined his company.

Working my way up from the bottom, but no one ever discovered our connection.

The number of times I met with him was even fewer than his meetings with ordinary employees.

Last week, a senior executive left, and this Monday they were to announce the successor.

Everyone said the position was mine for sure.

At least before I got the diagnosis report, I had thought so too.

In the hallway, I ran into a colleague who greeted me and then excitedly came closer:

"Mia, don't forget to treat us to a big dinner when you get promoted."

I smiled and looked down: "It's not certain yet."

"It's definitely going to be you," she linked arms with me, "You're the best out of everyone here."

When we entered the conference room, Jake was there. I happened to meet his gaze for a moment before we both looked away like strangers.

"Good morning, Mr. Jiang."

He didn't look at me, just nodded slightly.

As indifferent as if our argument that night had never happened.

People gradually filled up the conference room.

Jake cleared his throat, and my colleague immediately gave me a meaningful look.

I lowered my eyes to avoid her gaze.

The next second, I heard a familiar name.

"Tina Tang."

A familiar figure entered from outside. Slender and graceful, Tina smiled as warmly as ever.

Jake stood beside her, introducing her to everyone: "Miss Tang has just returned from abroad and will be taking over the deputy manager position."

Some people instinctively glanced at me. I avoided their eyes and looked at the beaming Tina on the stage. The atmosphere in the room seemed to stagnate for a moment.

Invisible undercurrents stirred.

I smiled and applauded.

Scattered applause broke the slightly awkward atmosphere in the conference room.

Tina met my eyes, her expression warm and friendly.
