The moment Jake's office door opened, I saw Tina sitting on the sofa, her head slightly bowed.

She was clutching a piece of paper in her hand.

And Jake, sitting there with a cold expression, suppressing his anger.

People used to say that even though Jake and I came from the same womb, only our eyes looked alike.

Upturned at the corners, when not smiling, they naturally carried a cold aura that kept people at a distance.

Unfortunately, neither of us liked to smile.

And Jake had never smiled at me.

"Although Tina is new, she has the qualifications for this position."

"Mia."

Jake frowned deeply as he called my name.

"If you have complaints, say them directly. Gossiping behind people's backs, ganging up with colleagues to isolate Tina - Mia, is your viciousness ingrained in your bones?"

In just half a day.

I glanced sideways at Tina. She happened to look up and meet my eyes.

Her face, in her early twenties, was full of collagen. Her eyes were slightly red, with tears reflecting tiny flecks of light.

Then she quickly lowered her head again.

All the actors in this farce were in place, just waiting for me to play my part. But I really had no interest in acting out their drama.

"What other people say with their own mouths has nothing to do with me."

"Besides-"

"Everyone's not stupid."

A sob and the sound of something falling to the ground rang out simultaneously. The expensive pen that had been on the desk was now shattered into pieces.

Black ink spread by my feet.

"Mia! You..."

A light piece of paper fell on his desk.

Jake's words were cut off. When he saw the text clearly, his anger immediately resurged: "Mia!"

"Are you still a child?"

"Are you throwing a tantrum?"

The crisp new resignation letter was crumpled into a ball and thrown back at my feet like trash.

It's not a tantrum at all.

I've known for a long time.

I don't have the right to throw tantrums.

Only children who are coddled have that privilege.

And I don't.

"I'll go to HR myself."

As I closed the door, his roar was shut out along with it.

But I hadn't walked far before Tina caught up with me.

"Mia." Her voice still had a nasal quality, and she carefully reached for my hand.

"Mia, don't be angry. I don't want this position. I'll go talk to Jake. Don't be upset."

"If I had known, I wouldn't have come back. Mia, don't let me ruin the relationship between you and your brother."

There was no one in the hallway.

I stopped and looked at her.

Tina's eyes naturally carried an air of innocence and pitifulness. Combined with her slightly reddened eyes and nose tip, she could easily win others' favor.

She looked just like she did over ten years ago, when she first came to our home.

"Tina."

I moved closer to her, gripping her chin, "This trick never fails-"

"Does it?"

Tina's face instantly turned pale.

The elevator arrival chime sounded.

I let go of her and walked towards the elevator. She seemed not to have recovered, standing rooted to the spot.

I smiled at her: "You know very well, there was never any sibling affection between him and me."

"Come to think of it, you're more like his sister."
