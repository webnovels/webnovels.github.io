Less than half an hour after hanging up, Olivia came back.

I thought she would continue her explanation from earlier, but she didn't.

Acting as if nothing had happened, she handed me a prepared gift: "Take a look, do you like it? I picked it out especially for you."

It was a Patek Philippe watch, quite expensive, I'd heard of it.

In the past, she would always bring me small gifts when she came back, but never anything this expensive. Maybe she also realized that this time was different from before.

In the past, a cake, a hug, or even a simple smile would have been enough to appease me.

But today, even with this million-dollar watch in front of me, my expression remained indifferent, without any emotion. I just said a bland "Thank you."

Disappointment flashed across Olivia's face. She could clearly sense that something was off with me.

But she didn't dare to bring up her public announcement with Marcus, because she felt guilty. She could only deliberately change the subject: "Aiden, I'm hungry. Can you make me some chicken soup noodles?"

The noodles were pre-packaged, but the chicken soup had to be freshly made.

Every time she said she wanted to eat something, I would rush to prepare the ingredients for her without complaint, no matter how troublesome it was. But today, I didn't want to do anything.

"There's bread in the fridge. If you're hungry, just eat some yourself."

"Aiden!"

Seeing that I still maintained an indifferent attitude, Olivia finally lost her temper: "Can you stop being moody? Do you know how many interviews I canceled to come back and comfort you! Can't you be more understanding of my work?"

"No!" I interrupted her.

Looking up, my eyes still like a midnight lake, without any ripples: "Olivia, let's break up."

Even after so many days of self-healing, when I saw the one I once loved deeply, my heart still uncontrollably ached, the pain blocking my chest, making it difficult to breathe.

But I still said those words stuck in my throat.

This ridiculous underground relationship had lasted for five years. My feelings for her had long since reached their end.

I no longer wanted to wait in an empty house for her return, no longer wanted to watch her various scandals, and no longer wanted to love her.

I was tired.

When she heard the words 'break up', Olivia's face turned pale, showing unprecedented panic and shock.

Before she could speak, I opened the door and left.
