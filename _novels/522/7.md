It turned out that half an hour ago, Olivia had posted a clarification on Twitter, publicly revealing our five-year underground relationship.

She also released candid photos of me cooking and several life photos. The nine-grid post was full of love, accompanied by a 500-word caption explaining that her previous admission of a relationship with Marcus Shaw was a joke because she lost a bet.

She said from beginning to end, she only had one boyfriend.

That was me.

My breath caught, my heart filled with mixed emotions.

Marcus also immediately replied to this tweet: "Sister Olivia's willingness to admit defeat in a bet is admirable. It was all a misunderstanding. Brother-in-law, please don't be angry."

The comment section exploded instantly, with a flood of criticism.

Many accused Olivia of taking the joke too far and treating her fans like fools. Some even continued to say that only Marcus was a good match for her.

Only a handful of people expressed their blessings.

I don't know how Olivia persuaded Marcus to act out this farce with her, but while everyone else was moved to tears, I remained exceptionally clear-headed.

I once eagerly looked forward to the day when we could make our relationship public, fantasizing about being able to walk hand in hand with her on the street openly, receiving everyone's blessings.

But at this moment, apart from a full sense of helplessness, there was only indifference after disappointment.

In just a few minutes, the video of the famous actress proposing to an ordinary man online instantly went viral across the country, squeezing to the top of the trending list and the headlines of major media outlets.

Many bloggers and reporters started live streaming, following Olivia as she ran towards my location holding a bouquet of flowers.

Everyone was driven crazy by her courage and sincerity. Many fans had already gathered at the entrance of my company to clear the way for her.

For a moment, this live broadcast in the name of a proposal was watched by hundreds of millions of viewers across the country.

While I was still in a daze, a cheer suddenly erupted outside the company.

Olivia had arrived.
