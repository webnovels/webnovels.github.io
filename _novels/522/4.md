From the moment I saw her falling into Marcus' arms, all the feelings I had built up over the years were shattered, leaving my heart as cold as ashes.

Olivia quickly chased after me.

"Aiden, don't be angry. Marcus and I really are just work partners..." Her voice was pleading in front of my friends.

I just calmly replied: "I'm not angry. It has nothing to do with me anymore."

"Stop denying it, Aiden. You're breaking up with me because you're jealous of Marcus."

"I've explained many times that those rumors are just part of my work. If you mind, I can clarify them right now. Please don't talk about breaking up anymore, okay?"

She was still rambling on, always using work as an excuse for her unavoidable actions.

She would never admit that she had ever divided her heart in our love.

I suddenly felt that her desperate clinging and lies were extremely ugly.

I shook off her hand and hailed a taxi, leaving without looking back.

Just as I got home, I suddenly received a dismissal notice from the HR department.

"Aiden, this is a decision from upper management. I couldn't do anything about it," the HR staff said apologetically. "I heard someone deliberately set you up. Did you offend anyone?"

I had always been kind to others and never offended anyone.

But since the company fired me for this reason, I didn't care. After all, I wasn't relying on that salary to make money anyway.

After hanging up, an unknown number called immediately.

When I answered, a man's voice came through: "How does it feel to be fired, Aiden?"

I immediately recognized the voice.

It was Marcus.

So the person behind this was him.

My fists clenched tightly, nails digging into my palms. The pain mixed with hatred swept through my entire body.

"You're just a useless piece of trash who can't even earn $5000 a month now. What right do you have to cling to Olivia? I advise you to get lost quickly."

"With me around, I'll make sure you can never find a job again, haha."

He laughed arrogantly, completely different from his gentle and elegant image on TV, like a devil devouring people from hell.

Just like how he was in middle school.

But no matter what he looked like, in my eyes, he was disgusting.

I sneered coldly, interrupting his ugly laughter: "Is that so? Then you're bound to lose."
