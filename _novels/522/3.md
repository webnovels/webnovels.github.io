Amidst everyone's shock, Olivia nodded slightly in greeting, then pulled out a chair and sat down quietly next to me.

Except for me, she always had an innate sense of aloofness towards everyone.

"What are you doing here?" My voice was polite but distant, instantly pulling our relationship far apart.

She frowned in dissatisfaction, but her tone was gentle: "I rarely have free time, so I wanted to spend more time with you."

I coldly replied: "You don't need to do this. We're breaking up anyway."

"I won't agree to break up." She took a deep breath, interrupting me, "You're just jealous and want to make our relationship public, right? Fine, I'll satisfy you."

After saying this, she reached for my glass and stood up, her tone returning to its usual haughtiness: "Hello everyone, I'm Aiden's girlfriend."

"Due to work reasons, I've been hiding my relationship with Aiden. Please don't mind."

As she finished speaking, she raised the glass amidst everyone's shocked gazes. Before it could touch her lips, I snatched the glass away.

"Enough, Olivia."

"We've already broken up."

The glass slammed heavily on the table, rolling twice before coming to a stop.

After saying this, I ignored her slightly reddened eyes and turned to leave directly.

I stumbled out drunkenly, the dark night road dim and bleak. The darkness mixed with the smell of alcohol, surrounding me tightly.

My thoughts were a bit chaotic, making me recall the scene of Olivia raising her glass. My chest suddenly felt tight and I couldn't breathe.

Olivia never drank alcohol, saying she hated the taste.

But I had once seen her drunk in a video leaked by paparazzi, half of her body leaning against Marcus' embrace, raising her glass to please the producers at the table: "I hope everyone can give Marcus a chance, he will definitely perform well."

For Marcus' sake, she who never touched alcohol downed three glasses of whiskey in one go, finally falling drunkenly into Marcus' arms.

And that day was my birthday. I sat in front of the cake waiting all night, but she never came back.

Later she called to explain: "There were many producers and directors at the wrap party for the new drama, I really couldn't get away. When I have time to come back, I'll definitely make it up to you with a proper birthday celebration."

But Olivia, I don't need it anymore.
