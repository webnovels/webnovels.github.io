After Olivia and I confirmed our relationship, she said we couldn't reveal our relationship in public to avoid suspicion.

For three whole years, Olivia and I never appeared together in anyone's sight.

My family and friends knew nothing of her existence. She never attended any of my friend gatherings either.

Even last year when my grandmother was critically ill and wanted to see my girlfriend before she passed away, I called Olivia in tears, hoping she could spare some time to see the old lady.

Even though she heard the choke in my voice, she only hesitated for a few seconds before firmly refusing.

"Aiden, you know my current status. It's not convenient for me..."

After that, I never again made requests to introduce her to my family and friends.

I just didn't expect that today, for the sake of my job, she would step in as my girlfriend for the first time.

But I no longer needed it.

Olivia's status was not something Marcus could match.

Hearing her make such a cooperation request, the director changed his ugly attitude from earlier and apologized to me with a smile: "Aiden, why didn't you say earlier that you had such a connection with Miss Sullivan?"

"I was wrong before, please don't mind. How about this, I'll make an exception and promote you to project manager, fully responsible for this cooperation. Your year-end bonus will be tripled."

But I just threw my work badge on the table expressionlessly and refused directly.

"Sorry, I quit."

After saying that, I turned around coolly. The surrounding colleagues were dumbfounded, all shocked by my actions once again.

The colleagues in the hall had already exploded into discussion. When they saw me come out, they swarmed around me.

"Wow Aiden, you've really been hiding your talents! We never imagined the famous actress Olivia Sullivan would be your girlfriend."

"Olivia Sullivan just updated her Twitter. Not only did she clarify the previous rumors with Marcus Shaw, but she also announced her relationship with you. She's already changed into a wedding dress and is preparing to come propose to you!"

Before I could react, a colleague shoved their phone into my hands and played a video.

In the video, Olivia was wearing a pure white wedding dress. Her exquisite makeup was cold yet noble. She stared at the camera, her deep gaze seeming to penetrate the screen and look into my eyes.

She said: "Aiden, are you ready to marry me?"
