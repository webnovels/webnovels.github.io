My own sister tricked me into choosing a fox as my Beast-kin mate. I tore off my arm for him, plucking rare herbs to help him grow his nine tails. Yet, at the most crucial moment, when I was about to claim victory in the trials, he betrayed me. He personally pushed me into a fiery abyss, all to help my sister seize the Clan Leader’s position.

But then, my eyes snapped open. I was back. Reborn to the very day I had to choose my Beast-kin.

Kaelen, the fox, looked at me with yearning, his eyes wide and hopeful.

Under his expectant gaze, I pointed to the small, unnoticed wolf standing quietly in the corner.

“I want him!”

Kaelen instantly crumbled, clinging desperately to my leg. “Please, take me with you!”

The little wolf, Ryker, kicked him away. “She’s mine! Don’t you dare try to snatch her!”
