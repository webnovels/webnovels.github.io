I was on the fast track to becoming the prime-time news anchor.

Then, the station airdropped a Stanford journalism grad—a beauty named Chloe Shi.

Management issued a challenge: whoever lands the exclusive interview with the elusive billionaire CEO of the Ji Group, Ethan Ji, gets the anchor chair.

I thought I had it in the bag. After all, Ethan is my secret husband.

But Ethan granted the interview to Chloe and rejected me.

When I found out Chloe was his first love, I knew we were done.

I voluntarily applied for a transfer to the Donbas region as a war correspondent.

In career and love, I had to grasp at least one, right?

Ethan, this time, I’m the one walking away.

Chapter 1

A gasp rippled through the office.

Everyone was gathered around Chloe.

The director looked at her with undisguised admiration.

"As expected of a high-achiever from Stanford. Congratulations, Chloe. The task was assigned yesterday, and today you've secured the exclusive with the CEO of Ji Group."

Ethan Ji never accepted interviews. Everyone in the industry knew this.

The Ji Group didn't need publicity through media interviews; Ethan Ji himself was the best billboard.

Chloe smiled, the corners of her mouth lifting. "It's just part of the job. It's what I should do."

Colleagues were surprised and delighted that Chloe secured the interview.

Since taking over the Ji Group, Ethan had never accepted an interview from any media outlet.

My smile was a bit forced.

I had been at the City TV station for five years.

I was one step away from being promoted to the prime-time news anchor.

But yesterday, I was suddenly notified of a new female host joining us.

Beautiful, professional, and strong.

A master's degree in journalism from abroad.

Her introduction was generous and confident.

"Hi everyone, I'm Chloe Shi."

"Although I graduated from Stanford Journalism, I've never worked in this industry and lack experience."

"I'll need everyone's guidance in the future."

She was polite and unpretentious, winning the favor of many colleagues.

But when her eyes met mine...

The corners of her mouth lifted slightly, carrying a hint of smugness.

The director called both of us into the office and assigned the task.

"Sarah," he said to me.

"We hope to get an exclusive interview with Ethan Ji of the Ji Group. So the station is giving you two a test."

"Whoever can secure the exclusive with Ethan Ji will become the prime-time news anchor."

I secretly rejoiced. This shouldn't be a problem.

Because Ethan Ji is my secret husband.

Walking out of the office, Chloe extended her hand.

"Hi, Sarah."

"You can call me Chloe."

I raised an eyebrow slightly. She actually knew my name.

Her arrival was too sudden, as if she came specifically for me.

I pressed my lips into a smile. "Hello, I'm Sarah Xu. Just Sarah is fine."

We exchanged contact info.

Walking out of the office building side by side, she suddenly spoke.

"Sarah."

"Let's compete fairly."

It was just a hosting slot, yet her eyes were full of ambition.

It felt like we were competing for more than just a position.

Chapter 2

Last night, Ethan came home from a business dinner.

He smelled faintly of alcohol, his face slightly flushed.

His tailored shirt outlined his perfect physique, his suit jacket draped over his arm.

The light hit his face, highlighting his smooth jawline and high nose bridge under thick brows.

He lifted his eyelids to look at me. "Something up?"

I blurted out directly, "Will you accept my interview?"

He paused slightly, brows furrowing a bit.

After a moment of contemplation, he said, "Sarah."

"I don't accept any interviews, and there are no exceptions."

When the leadership assigned the task, I thought it was a sure thing.

Because Ethan is my husband.

So when I was rejected by Ethan, I felt a bit embarrassed.

I gathered my courage and asked him, "Even if I am your wife, can't I have a special exception?"

Ethan nodded. "Yes. Even if you are my wife."

I said, "Okay, I understand."

Actually, I thought if I couldn't get it, then Chloe couldn't get it either.

The next day, when the director announced that Chloe had secured the interview with Ethan...

I was dazed for a long time, just zoning out.

I don't know how to describe my feelings at that moment.

It felt like I lost the whole world in an instant.

Until my partner, Mia, comforted me: "Sarah, don't be sad."

"Just one look and you can tell she has connections. She was airdropped in, it's not your fault."

My distress was obvious.

But I wasn't just sad because of the failed promotion, but because Ethan didn't favor me.

Knowing that Chloe was Ethan's first love, I understood.

What Chloe wanted to compete with me for wasn't just the anchor position.

It was also Ethan.

After she secured the exclusive, she remained modest.

After the director left, she suggested, "How about I treat everyone to coffee?"

Colleagues were excited.

Just securing the interview with Ethan meant the KPIs for various departments were met half a year ahead of schedule.

Barring accidents, the year-end bonus would double.

So even though I didn't get the interview, I would still enjoy this bonus.

Everyone looked at Chloe like she was a savior.

A colleague said, "Chloe, you are amazing."

"Even the Crown Prince of the business world succumbed to you."

Chloe smiled sweetly. "We know each other."

After saying that, she looked at me.

Chloe raised an eyebrow slightly, then withdrew her gaze.

A seemingly light sentence, but with many hidden implications behind it.

It caused a small sensation.

"Chloe, you're so beautiful."

"Could it be you're the Crown Prince's girlfriend?"

Someone interjected, "That's not right, I heard the Crown Prince is secretly married."

Chloe's almond eyes flickered. "Whoever watches the coffee well can have mine."

Chloe didn't put on airs and quickly integrated with the colleagues.

A colleague invited Chloe to dinner after work.

Chloe declined. "Thanks, but I have plans tonight."

"Just returned to the country, friends are throwing a welcome dinner for me."

The colleague sighed with regret, then looked surprised. "Alright then. It couldn't be with Mr. Ji, right?"

Chloe blinked and didn't speak.

At the same time, Ethan sent me a message: "Business dinner tonight, will be late."

Although Ethan and I were secretly married, he never had any scandals and respected me.

He would report his whereabouts and exchange gifts on anniversaries and birthdays.

I had a premonition that the person welcoming Chloe tonight was Ethan.

Chapter 3

It's hard not to be curious about your husband's first love.

Chloe was a classic beauty.

She looked unapproachable but was actually proactive and enthusiastic.

This contrast made people feel she was nice.

Her social media showed another side of her, contrary to her looks. She posted a lot.

Simple text complaints, selfies, travel photos.

Seeing Ethan's profile picture in the likes list made my heart tremble slightly.

A slight sourness overflowed.

No comments, just likes.

Besides Ethan, a few of his good friends occasionally liked and commented.

From the comments of his friends, I could tell they had a good relationship before.

After scrolling through the visible posts from the last six months, I prepared to exit.

Chloe updated again.

In the photo, there was no Ethan.

But the arm in the corner, the person wearing the Rolex Submariner watch... I recognized it instantly.

It was Ethan.

"Hehe, thanks to my friends for the welcome dinner!"

Soon a colleague commented: "Wow, feels like big shots."

Chloe jokingly replied: "Then you are a friend of big shots."

It was strange. In just three days...

Chloe's social circle overlapped halfway with mine.

Seeping into every corner of my life.

Usually, I would leave a light on when Ethan came home late.

Tonight, I stood under the light.

Hesitated for a while.

Turned the light off.

Just as I was falling asleep, I heard the sound of running water in the bathroom.

Opening my eyes, Ethan stood by the bed.

His voice was pleasant, cool: "Why didn't you leave a light tonight?"

I clicked the bedside lamp off. "Forgot."

He climbed into bed. The faint scent of body wash and hormones lingered around me after his shower.

The man's strong and powerful arms imprisoned me tightly from behind.

I froze for a moment, then peeled his fingers open one by one, pushing his hand away.

"Ethan, I'm sleepy."

His voice was slightly hoarse: "Okay. You sleep, I'll hold you."

Chapter 4

Chloe had already permeated my life pervasively.

Even if I wanted to avoid her, I couldn't.

Because she was a newcomer, the director asked me to help her.

Mia was indignant for me: "Why? Just to pave the way for her?"

"She's impressive, clinging to the Crown Prince."

"She should just go home and be a rich wife, why come out and snatch rice bowls from us common folk?"

"You've worked conscientiously for the station for so many years, brought in so many sponsorships, what does this count for?"

I sighed: "Just my bad luck."

It was indeed bad luck.

For the prime-time anchor position, I started from the most basic chores.

I suffered a lot.

Carrying equipment weighing twenty pounds in the heat, running around construction sites and rice fields.

To seek justice for the grassroots people, to demand unpaid wages.

I was hit by a brick by a coal boss.

My head bled, and I didn't dare let my family or Ethan know.

Denouncing developers in unfinished buildings for buyers, exposing black-hearted entrepreneurs, falling from unfinished buildings.

Lying in the ambulance, I cried and begged the doctor to save me.

Even delirious from anesthesia, I was still muttering about work.

In the end, there are more five years.

Seeing Mia filled with righteous indignation, angrier than me.

I comforted her instead: "Forget it, forget it. It means this position doesn't belong to me."

At least, I met a good friend who genuinely cared about me.
