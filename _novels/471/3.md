Watching Chloe act so cold and heartless, I suddenly felt like the woman I’d been married to for ten years was a complete stranger.

She used to be so different.

Back when I was broke, I’d hand over my entire paycheck to her, thinking I’d ask her for money every time we ate out. But she never took a single cent.

I’d just finished signing the papers when Frank grew impatient. “Why hasn’t the money arrived yet?!”

“Just give me a little more time. It’ll be in your account today.”

But Chloe pulled out a promissory note and made me sign it. As soon as I did, she kicked Liam towards me with a disgusted look.

I clutched my son, my heart aching, and immediately called for a doctor.

Chloe pulled Brenda’s arm. “Alright, alright, Mom. I’ll talk to him nicely.”

When the doctor came in, Brenda reined herself in a lot, but her face still looked menacing.

Chloe gently wrapped an arm around Liam, pressing a soft kiss to his cheek. But Liam recoiled, pulling away.

Seeing that, I let out a cold laugh. Even Dr. Evans added, “The patient’s condition is quite unstable right now. This condition is extremely rare, perhaps only one case in a million. Please try not to agitate him.”

After a quick treatment, Liam’s nosebleed finally slowed. He spontaneously threw himself into my arms, listening quietly.

Chloe’s forced smile faltered a bit. She gave a strained laugh. “Liam is my son too. Of course, I wouldn’t just stand by. If you need help, I’ll certainly come and look after him!”

“It’s just… I can’t accept the thought of my own son passing away before me. If you can’t accept such a reality, I can understand. I’ll try my best to leave you with all the best resources, so you don’t have to face such a heavy blow alone.”

Brenda chimed in, “See how considerate Chloe is of you? Why can’t you be the same? Are you even a man, being so petty?”

I persisted, “Why can’t we face it together?”

Chloe sighed dramatically. 

“Not everyone can afford to waste their life like that. Dr. Evans just said Liam’s condition is one in a million! What if our future children have the same condition? What if you have a child with someone else outside of our marriage?”

I challenged her, feeling utterly powerless. “You don’t trust me?”

I honestly couldn't believe my wife would suspect me to such an extent.

From the day we started dating to our ten years of marriage, I had never once given her cause for concern. I’d never been involved in anything even remotely ambiguous with another person.

Yet now, she was even imagining me having children with someone else…

It chilled me to the bone.

I was about to argue further when, at that moment, Dr. Evans rushed over, looking frantic. He said he needed to speak with me privately about Liam’s condition.

Seeing the doctor’s urgency, Chloe assumed our son was beyond saving. She quickly grabbed her parents and hurried out of the room.

I followed Dr. Evans into his office, my heart pounding with dread.

But the doctor immediately bowed deeply to me, apologizing.

“Mr. Miller, I am so terribly sorry! Your son’s diagnosis was a mistake, a grave oversight on our hospital’s part.”



Once I understood the situation, I returned to Liam’s room and let out a long, shaky breath, looking at my son on the bed.

Dr. Evans respectfully handed me a medical report.
