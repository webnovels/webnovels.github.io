My husband, Jaxson, had lost everything in a terrible investment. He’d racked up massive debts, and the creditors had kidnapped him, threatening to sell his organs if I didn't pay up.

Over the phone, his voice choked with tears. “Forget about me, Harper. Maybe we’ll find each other in the next life…”

To save him, I made the agonizing choice to abort my two-month-old baby. Then, I agreed to the creditors’ demands: I would become a surrogate.

Four months later, I stumbled upon Jaxson and his widowed sister-in-law, Sera, sharing a dark secret.

“Don’t worry, Sera,” Jaxson’s voice was smooth, reassuring. “The doctors say *our* triplets are perfectly healthy.”

Sera’s voice, sugary sweet, followed. “Besides the title of Mrs. Hayes, I can give you everything. The fortune, the children—they’re all yours!”

“Once Harper delivers, I’ll find an excuse. I’ll say she’s tainted, and I’ll never touch her again!” Jaxson promised.

“I belong only to you!”

I laughed. A hollow, bitter sound. My heart didn't just break; it shattered into a million irreparable pieces.

Fine. If that’s how it is, then the role of Mrs. Hayes? You two can have it.
