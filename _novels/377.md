I was Julian’s Nine-Tailed Kitsune slave, his kept woman – fragile, obedient, and compliant with his every demand.
Everyone thought I was madly in love with him.
Then came the day of his engagement party, when he planned to send me back to the Beastkin Containment Facility.
"My fiancée can't stand the sight of dirty things like you. Be a good girl, I'll visit you later."
I cried my eyes out in front of him, then turned around, shifted into my true form, and burrowed my large tail right into his best friend's arms.
Much later, Julian regretted it, thinking he could give me a chance to tempt him again.
But by then, I was already in Arthur's bed.
The man, usually so composed, had eyes blazing red with urgency. His pale fingers fumbled shyly with my white shirt.
"Just let me touch your tail, please. I'm begging you."
…

It was an ordinary evening when I found out Julian was getting engaged to Chloe, the heiress of the Sterling family.
He was lounging in his bathrobe, a cigarette between his fingers, his face still holding a hint of lingering satisfaction.
"You should pack your things these next couple of days. I'll have someone send you back to the Beastkin Containment Facility."
My heart sank. I clung to his arm, delicate and sweet, my voice laced with a tempting purr.
"Did I do something wrong?"
His gaze swept over my body, indifferent, as if stating the most mundane fact. "I'm getting engaged."
"Chloe is pure and innocent; she can't tolerate dirty things like you. Be a good girl, and I'll visit you later."
His words felt like a chokehold, suffocating me, tears threatening to spill. But meeting Julian's dismissive stare, I swallowed them back.
Julian hated weepy women. I had no right to cry in front of him, especially since I was just his kept Beastkin slave.
Still, I couldn't accept it. I’d gone through so much to escape that place and cling to him. For five years, I’d been utterly compliant, hoping for freedom one day.
I lifted my wet eyes. "But Willow can't leave Mr. Julian. You could keep Willow outside, or... release my indenture contract. I'll go far away, I promise not to bother Ms. Chloe."
He didn't respond, just blew out a smoke ring, his eyes distant. "Go wash up."
I rose, quiet and obedient, not daring to let the tears fall until I was safely in the bathroom.
I was Julian's indentured Beastkin, considered lower than a mistress in the eyes of the world.
In this world, Beastkin are born inferior. Some people with specific preferences keep a portion of Beastkin as slaves for the wealthy to choose from. The Beastkin Containment Facility is where these Beastkin are bred. Rules there are strict, and Beastkin are treated no differently than commodities.
I’d been with Julian for five years, assuming he’d release my bond when he married, granting me my freedom. I never imagined that the first thing he’d do after his engagement was send me back to that hell.
I hated that place, but unless a human was willing to buy me and set me free, I had no options.
Seeing my tear-reddened eyes, a flicker of secret triumph crossed Julian's gaze. He spoke, as if granting a reward.
"I have a reception tomorrow. You can come with me."
Our Nine-Tailed Kitsune tribe is naturally beautiful. Whenever I accompanied Julian, different men would always stare at me with awestruck eyes.
Before, I never cared, but today was different.
My eyes darted around, assessing the men in the room.
Married men were out. Men who wouldn't dare offend Julian were out. Unattractive men were out.
Finally, only two viable targets remained: one was Julian's best friend, Arthur. But he was known for his impeccable character, a paragon of virtue who maintained strict personal boundaries. He'd never be interested in someone like me, and might even tell Julian.
The other was Dorian, Julian's sworn enemy. Since they had a feud, seducing him would be twice as effective.
Even an idiot would know who to choose. I picked up a glass of red wine and, while Julian was chatting with someone else, discreetly made my way toward Dorian.
He was leaning against the railing, practically radiating "do not approach."
Men like that are the easiest to hook. I'd just get close, pretend to accidentally spill red wine all over myself.
I slowly approached him, mentally rehearsing the script a hundred times. But just then, I was bumped hard.
The wine glass flew from my hand, the red wine splashing entirely onto the white suit in front of me.
The room went silent for a moment.
Arthur looked down at his stained suit. His excellent upbringing kept him calm and gentle even now. "Ms. Willow, you've soiled my suit."
I hadn't expected this. I stepped back, testing the waters. "So, do you want Julian to pay for it?"
His eyes lowered slightly, a gentle smile curving his rosy lips. "That won't be necessary. Your dress is stained too. Let's go upstairs and change."
Only then did I notice the red wine on my own dress. I had no choice but to follow him upstairs.
I deliberately lingered in the room for a long time, assuming he would have left. When I finally opened the door, I found myself face to face with him.
"What a coincidence."
He had changed into a gray suit. Under the bright lights, the clean lines highlighted his lean, strong waist.
I didn't want to talk to him. I mumbled a few perfunctory words and descended the stairs, one step behind him. As soon as I reached the bottom, I headed straight for Dorian.
I was confident that with my looks and Dorian's terrible relationship with Julian, I could make something happen with just one move.
I composed myself, putting on an innocent, harmless facade, and walked toward where Dorian had been standing, only to find the railing deserted.
Arthur came up from behind me, swirling his wine glass, his expression mild. A fleeting smile seemed to flash in his dark eyes. "Are you looking for Dorian?"
"He had an emergency and just left."
My hopes completely deflated.
I hung my head dejectedly. I really didn't want to go back to that place.
My gaze shifted, landing on Arthur beside me.
