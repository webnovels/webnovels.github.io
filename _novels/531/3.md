An hour later, that wolf was brought before me.

His wounds had been bandaged, his body cleaned, and that bloody smell had dissipated.

Looking at that cold, aggressive face, a desire to conquer rose in my heart.

"What's your name?"

"Lucas."

His voice was low and powerful. Even wrapped in bandages, it couldn't hide the intimidating aura around him.

I looked him over carelessly, only now noticing his pale complexion and deliberately straightened back, though without much strength.

"How did you get these injuries?"

Lucas pressed his lips tightly together, his voice cold: "In the fighting arena, I was clawed by a tiger a few times."

Dissatisfaction flashed in my eyes. I had been distracted when choosing him, but thought a wolf couldn't be too bad. I didn't expect him to be a weak wolf.

Suddenly, I had the idea of sending him back to the fighting arena.

I sneered, "So weak? How will you protect me in the future?"

Lucas's expression froze, disgust flashing briefly in his eyes.

Very good, he really was an ungrateful wolf.

I smirked and laughed coldly, my eyes instantly turning cold.

"Hmm? Answer me, if you're so weak, how will you protect me in the future?"

Lucas's gaze was deep, his voice louder.

"I fought for five days straight. On the last day, I encountered a tiger at full strength, which is why I was unfortunately injured. But even so, I still won. I don't think I'm weak, and I'm capable of protecting you well, Second Miss."

He practically spat out the last sentence through gritted teeth.

This was still an untamed wolf.

Cold sweat broke out on Lucas's forehead, his lips much paler than before.

Clearly, this wolf had his own ideas. He wanted to go to my sister's side, and he didn't submit to me.

Since that was the case, I'd let my sister be the first to tame him.
