After we chose our beast-men, the rest would be sent to the fighting arena.

That little fox wasn't chosen by my sister.

He crawled forward desperately, disregarding everything else.

"Miss, please, take me with you too, I'm begging you."

Chloe's eyes flashed with disgust. She covered her nose, frowning as she waved her hand.

"Take him away, take him away."

Chloe loved beautiful and cute things, and naturally her beast-men were no exception.

The little fox Noah was filthy all over, with wounds on his face.

In my previous life, I was soft-hearted and liked foxes, so I took him away.

My sister was different - except for those she cared about, she was equally cruel to everyone.

Seeing Chloe had no interest in him, Noah turned his gaze to me.

"Second Miss, don't you want me anymore? I'm Noah, I'm your little fox, Second Miss."

Noah's captivating eyes were pitiful. So he was reborn too. Perfect, I was curious to see what kind of life he'd have without my protection.

I turned my head away, stroking the new beast-man at my side.

"My beast-man is clearly a wolf, when did he become a fox? A beast-man without self-awareness deserves to be taught a lesson."

As I finished speaking, Noah was roughly dragged out of the room.

Only when the door closed did it finally cut off his wailing.

Chloe beckoned, and her little rabbit immediately came forward. Just as the rabbit was about to touch her, there was a loud crack as a whip fell on the rabbit's body.

"You filthy thing, how dare you touch me? Who gave you the courage?"

The little rabbit immediately shrank back pitifully. Seeing this, the disgust in Chloe's eyes gradually dissipated.

She stood up, tossing the whip to an attendant, then said goodbye to me before striding away.

Behind her, that little rabbit followed closely, step by step.
