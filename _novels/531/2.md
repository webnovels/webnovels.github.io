I snorted with laughter, then looked back and realized my beast-man's gaze had been fixed on a certain spot the whole time.

I followed his line of sight and sneered. So, I'd chosen an ungrateful wolf. Did he want to be chosen by my sister that badly?

I stood up, looking down at him coldly. My voice was icy.

"If you don't want to follow me, you can say so. I'll have someone send you back. But if you follow me with ulterior motives, I'll make you suffer."

The beast-man looked up, his gaze piercing as he looked at me. "I'm willing to follow you, with no ulterior motives."

His words were firm, but I didn't know how much I could trust them.

I nodded slightly and said flatly, "Then follow me."

Leaving the main villa, I made my way back to my own territory.

As we entered, I handed the beast-man over to the butler.

"Teach him the rules, and get him cleaned up."

The butler bowed in acknowledgment.

This beast-man was really too dirty, with wounds all over his body and a strong smell of blood.

I left the beast-man behind and went upstairs alone.

After the lesson from my previous life, I had developed a deep aversion to beast-men from the bottom of my heart.

They were disloyal and ruthless, but our clan had rules that every woman must choose a beast-man as a guardian when she came of age.

If we didn't choose, the clan leader would forcibly pair us up.

In my previous life, I was probably too indulgent with Noah, which led to him daring to overstep his bounds.

This time, I was determined to tame this ungrateful wolf into an obedient cat.
