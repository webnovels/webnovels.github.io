On our fifth wedding anniversary, Emily went hiking and didn't return all night. It was pouring rain, and I was frantic with worry. After alerting the police, I organized a search party. We discovered her sharing a sleeping bag with her childhood friend, Alex, both enveloped in a close embrace and a kiss. When she saw me, she had an explanation ready.
"He has a congenital heart condition, and I was afraid he'd get hypothermia, so I stayed with him!"
Alex clutched his chest, feigning distress.
"Don't be angry with her; she was just concerned for me..."
I noticed her clothes, including intimate wear, scattered beside the sleeping bag. With a sardonic smile, I taunted them.
"You two have been friends since childhood, so is sharing a sleeping bag a big deal? Mind if I join?"
1.
When I said this, my friends who had come to search with me couldn't help but snicker. Despite being soaked by the rain and anxious over Fiona's disappearance, witnessing their kiss left me feeling hollow. Fiona glared at me, her face flushed with anger, a silver thread at the corner of her mouth from their hasty separation.
"Jude, what do you mean by that? Are you doubting me?"
I applauded her performance with a cold smile.
"How could I doubt you? Why not consider my suggestion?"
Beyond witnessing their kiss, I saw Fiona's underwear among the clothes. Before Fiona could respond, someone came to her defense.
"Jude, you can't talk like that. Fiona is a doctor. She must be worried about Gideon."
It was Fiona's best friend, speaking as if I were the one being unreasonable. I glanced at her, then stepped forward to pick up Fiona's bra from the pile, waving it around. Her expression froze, wanting to speak but remaining silent.
"I never knew that not wearing clothes is the best way to stay warm."
"Having just me isn't enough for a woman like you, apparently."
I said coldly, mocking her. Fiona was furious and shouted back.
"Shut up! I'm your wife; how dare you speak to me like that?!"
She trembled, trying to snatch the underwear from me but failing. Fiona looked at me in disbelief, as if seeing me for the first time. I used to be completely under her control, doing everything she asked because I loved her. But this incident shattered everything, leaving nothing to ignore.
"Fiona, don't be mad." At this point, Gideon coughed a few times, holding his chest. He emerged from the sleeping bag in his underwear, handing her a jacket. Fiona was all about Gideon, heartbroken by his cough.
"Gideon, I'm fine. It's your health we should be worried about..."
Then she rebuked me, "See, I was really worried about Gideon's health, and you still doubt me!"
I felt exhausted, not even wanting to argue anymore. Gideon coughed, and she was heartbroken, but I searched for her for hours in soaked clothes, ignored by her. I used to overlook this double standard, but now I'm curious how I endured it.
"Never mind. After we divorce, you'll have all the time to care for Gideon. How you care for him then is none of my business."
The word "divorce" made Fiona pause and frown at me.
"It's just a small thing; why talk about divorce?"
I chuckled, mocking her.
"Of course, to make it easier for you to care for Gideon. If he's a doctor's family member, it’s more convenient, right?"
"By the way, after that kiss, check for STDs."
"Don’t involve me in that mess."
Gideon turned pale and fainted at my words. Fiona ignored everything else, got up, and grabbed the clothes from me to put on. She glared at me, full of hatred, and slapped me.
"Jude, if something happens to Gideon, I won't let you off!"
"You'll be a murderer!"
Fiona called 911 and took Gideon to the hospital. I stood there, the sting from her slap making me painfully aware. I laughed bitterly. When we first got together, I had checked on Gideon. He doesn’t have a heart condition; it was all an act. Yet even an act could fool Fiona completely.
When I returned home, dawn was breaking. The rain left me dizzy, so I took medicine and slept. Half-asleep, I heard the door open.
2.
Fiona approached the bed, reeking of alcohol. The smell made me wrinkle my nose. Didn't she take Gideon to the hospital? Why is she back drunk? Before I could figure it out, she pulled me up forcefully.
"Jude, what's gotten into you today? Why did you say those things in front of everyone?"
"Why argue with a patient? Don't you have any empathy?"
Fiona's face was flushed, acting all wronged. She questioned me as if she hadn’t been in a sleeping bag with Gideon. Being yanked from sleep, I naturally wasn’t in the mood for pleasantries. Besides, I was done with her, not planning to have any more ties.
She was always so proud, thinking I was her loyal dog, no matter how she hurt me, I’d stick around. But seeing her kiss Gideon, my blood froze. I dared not imagine what I’d see if I had come later.
Seeing my silence, she angrily pointed at me and shouted.
"You almost gave Gideon a heart attack, and you're playing silent?!"
I looked at Fiona and coldly replied.
"Aren’t I just helping you two out? You even went hiking and slept together."
"Didn't you say if he hadn’t left, you would’ve married him? We divorce, I give him the spot, isn't that good?"
Fiona hesitated, not expecting me to bring up the past.
"What nonsense! Gideon and I grew up together, there’s nothing like that!"
"We slept together as kids, why can't you let it go!"
She angrily threw a gift box at my face.
"Even bought you a gift to make up!"
The box hit my nose, blood dripping, staining the tie that fell out. I looked at the tie and sighed. I’ve received seven or eight identical ties.
Seeing my nosebleed, Fiona panicked, trying to wipe it but I stopped her. Seeing me hurt, she softened her tone.
"Jude, I don’t want to fight. Let’s each take a step back and move on."
"I promise, once Gideon is well, I’ll leave him alone."
This was the first time she lowered herself, at the cost of my injury. Hearing her say she’d leave Gideon, I chuckled.
"Stop giving him those prescription drugs, and he’ll be fine."
Fiona, as a doctor, secretly gave Gideon illegal prescription drugs with strong side effects and addiction. She knew, but she’d do anything for her childhood friend.
I felt utterly drained, unwilling to talk more, packed and headed to work. Before leaving, Fiona quietly pleaded for me to stay. Seeing my resolve, she glared at me.
"Jude, you’re so ungrateful! Don’t come back if you leave!"
I turned away without regret. She still thought showing weakness would mean I’d forgive her endlessly. But that was based on love. Now there’s none, it’s all empty.
3.
"Mr. Jude, your wife is here." My assistant rushed into my office. I’ve been staying at the office, but I’d told my assistant not to let Fiona in. I was exhausted, having focused solely on her, I’d neglected work. Taking the reins now, I felt overwhelmed.
Before I could respond, Fiona barged in with a cake. Her eyes lit up seeing me, putting the cake down and crossing her arms.
"Jude, I missed our anniversary, and you missed my birthday."
"We're even."
She didn’t wait for my reply, saying it all herself. I was speechless. I’d been so busy I forgot Fiona’s birthday. Since being with her, her birthday was my top priority. I’d always prepare in advance to surprise her.
When she saw me, her eyes brightened as she placed the cake on my desk and crossed her arms, looking at me with a sense of superiority.
"Jude, I missed our anniversary, and you missed my birthday. So, we're even now."
She didn't wait for my response and continued talking on her own. I was left speechless. I've been so caught up with work that Fiona's birthday slipped my mind. Ever since we started dating, her birthday was a day I never failed to plan for, always trying to surprise her. Yet, no matter what I did, she never seemed to care. Meanwhile, Gideon could do the smallest thing, and she'd be touched for days.
Last year, I went all out, taking her to her favorite place, buying expensive front-row concert tickets for her favorite singer, and even spending half a month at a temple praying for a peace charm. But none of this made her as happy as the roadside flower Gideon gave her, which is ironic since she's allergic to pollen.
Forgetting her birthday this time felt like a weight off my shoulders, a sign that I was finally moving on. I looked at Fiona's haughty demeanor, my expression icy.
"Do you really think we're even?"
"Maybe I should spend a night with my ex, then."
Predictably, Fiona was furious. She lashed out at me.
"Jude, how did you become like this?"
"You're my husband, and you forgot my birthday. Only Gideon remembered!"
Her accusation was laughable because she forgot that I had never missed her birthday before.
"Fiona, I think I've made myself clear. There's nothing between us anymore."
"We're getting a divorce, and I'll make room for Gideon. It's that simple."
Gideon always enjoyed Fiona's favoritism, while I naively believed that time would eventually win her over. I was so wrong.
Fiona's expression wavered, as if she couldn't believe I was serious. She lit the candles on the cake and said,
"Didn't you promise to grant my birthday wish every year?"
I frowned, sensing something.
"This year, my wish is for you to forgive me."
"Okay?"
Unexpectedly, I saw a hint of vulnerability on her face, but I quickly realized it was just a façade. I shook my head and said bluntly,
"If you really wanted to be with me, you wouldn't keep falling for Gideon's lies."
I looked at her, and all the past emotions were gone.
"You're a doctor and his childhood friend. Don't you know if he has a congenital heart condition?"
That statement ignited the awkward tension between us. Fiona threw the cake at me, nearly hitting my eye with the candle.
"You're still slandering Gideon!"
Her chest heaved with anger, her eyes filled with hatred.
"I misjudged you. You're a company owner, so why do you have to be against Gideon?"
"How could I not know if he has a heart condition? You're just ignorant of his suffering to say such disgusting things!"
With that, she turned and left, leaving only her determined back.
I signaled to my stunned assistant.
"Draft a divorce agreement for me."
I thought everything was settled, just waiting for the papers to be signed. But that night, Fiona called, her voice tearful.
"Jude, come quickly. Daphne is in trouble!"
Daphne is our daughter, spending her summer vacation with my mother. Hearing something happened to her, I rushed home.
The only thing holding me back from divorcing Fiona was Daphne. I didn't want her to grow up in a broken family.
