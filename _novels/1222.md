My parents always said that kids were nature’s punchlines—born specifically to be the subject of their entertainment.

That was why, every year on my birthday, they played a prank on me.

My first birthday, a jack-in-the-box that screamed instead of singing.

My second, they locked me in the laundry room with the non-venomous but terrifying pet boa constrictor.

My third, they took me to the amusement park and forced me to wander through the most intense haunted house by myself.

I grew to dread my birthday.

But on my sixth birthday, nothing happened.

My mom and dad even had my favorite cousin, Ruby, come over to play.

It wasn't until after we finished the cake that things went wrong.

My parents exchanged a look, and then, in unison, they tipped back the glasses of sparkling cider we’d been drinking and drained them.

They collapsed. When they woke up, they were hugging Ruby and calling her their sweet daughter.

I was terrified. I grabbed at my mom’s silk dress, sobbing until I couldn’t breathe, asking them what in God’s name was happening.

They held Ruby tight, their eyes flat and cold when they looked at me.

“We drank the Forget-Me-Juice,” my mom, Seraphina, said. “It makes you forget your own child.”

My parents looked down their noses at me, their faces stern, and ruthlessly pulled away.

“Who are you?” my dad, Elias, demanded. “Why are you in our house?”

I was so little.

I couldn’t hear the forced laughter they were stifling.

All I could do was cling to the hem of my mom’s expensive cashmere sweater, choking on my own tears.

“Mom, I’m Daisy. I’m your daughter.”

“It’s my sixth birthday today.”

But she pushed me away and pulled a confused Ruby further into her arms.

“I don’t know you. Ruby is my daughter.”

“You strange child, you need to leave our house immediately!”

My tears streamed down my face.

“No, you drank the Forget-Me-Juice! You forgot me!”

My mom frowned, acting as if she had no memory of the phrase she and my dad had just coined.

“Forget-Me-Juice? Don’t be ridiculous. There’s no such thing in the world!”

“You need to stop lying and stop trying to trick us!”

My dad grabbed me by the collar of my shirt and easily lifted me outside.

“Whose kid are you? Go on, beat it!”

I screamed and struggled, the cold air hitting my face.

But what strength does a six-year-old have against an adult man?

No matter how I cried, they were determined to drive me out.

I cried out to my cousin, Ruby. “Ruby… Ruby, tell Mom and Dad that I’m their daughter!”

Ruby started to open her mouth, but my mom pointed toward the playroom door.

“Ruby, you can only have whatever toy you want if you’re our daughter, you know.”

Ruby blinked once, then took my mother’s hand.

“Hurry up and make that strange girl leave!”

My dad heard her, and with a decisive thud, he shut the heavy front door.

It was snowing outside, and I was only wearing a thin, long-sleeve tee.

The wind cut through me like a blade.

The tears on my face froze dry, stinging my skin.

But no matter how hard I banged on the door, my parents had no intention of opening it.

I stumbled over to the floor-to-ceiling window, trembling.

I saw my mom open the playroom door, retrieve the stuffed animal I slept with every single night, and hand it to Ruby.

My clothes, my piggy bank—everything was being given to my cousin.

Ruby’s family wasn't wealthy. My Aunt Caroline and Uncle Owen couldn't afford a lot of toys or new clothes for her.

Now, my parents were giving Ruby all of my things.

I scratched at the cold glass, the tears never stopping.

Inside, my parents were still cooing to Ruby.

“Why is Ruby so sweet? Will you be our daughter forever and ever?”

Ruby nodded excitedly. “Yes! But what about Daisy?”

“Did you really drink the Forget-Me-Juice and forget her?”

My parents looked at each other and burst into loud laughter.

“How could we?!”

“We’re just messing with her, that’s all.”

“We’ll let her come back home in a few days once we’ve had our fun.”

The voices from inside were muffled and fractured.

But I heard enough.

I didn’t understand much about the world yet.

But I understood that.

There was no Forget-Me-Juice.

This was just another one of their pranks, and I was their toy.

2.

The snow got heavier and was now up to my shins.

I stumbled blindly away from the house, my feet slipping.

The security camera mounted over the front door shifted, centering on me.

But the people inside made no move to come out and open the door.

I didn't know the streets, or where to go.

My whole body ached with cold; my exposed fingers were turning a sickly purplish-red.

It was too cold.

I really couldn’t hold on any longer.

Up ahead, I saw a convenience store with a warm yellow light spilling out. I gritted my teeth and pushed the door open.

“Ma’am, can I just warm up here for a minute?”

“I promise I won’t get in the way of any customers.”

The woman behind the counter, a plump, kindly-looking woman named Linda, looked down, and her eyes widened instantly.

She quickly took off her own thick, puffy coat and wrapped it around me.

A wave of warmth washed over me, and the tears in my eyes were uncontrollable again.

“Oh, darling, you came out with so little on?”

“Where are your mother and father?”

I clutched the coat tightly, my voice a whisper: “They don’t want me anymore.”

“They are somebody else’s mom and dad now.”

Linda didn’t understand what I was saying.

She turned and poured a cup of warm water, pressing it into my hands, and then pulled a steaming hot dog from the warming roller behind the counter.

I sipped the water, and my body slowly began to thaw.

Linda said she needed to call the police to find my parents.

I huddled in the corner and shook my head. “I remember their phone numbers.”

Linda dialed my mother, Seraphina.

She answered quickly.

But when Linda mentioned me, Seraphina flatly denied it. “I don’t know this child you’re talking about.”

“My daughter is right here playing with her new doll!”

In the background, I could hear Ruby and my dad discussing how to build a LEGO set.

I lowered my head, and my tears fell silently onto the borrowed jacket, soaking in and disappearing.

Linda quickly reassured me. “Maybe you wrote down the wrong number for your mom. How about your dad?”

I said nothing, just listened as she dialed my dad, Elias.

He answered.

But his voice was full of irritation.

“Didn’t my wife just talk to you? We haven’t lost a child!”

“That kid, just figure it out. Don’t call this number again!”

Linda stared at the phone, which he had hung up, and laughed out of sheer disbelief.

“Sweetheart, are you sure these are your mom and dad?”

As she asked the question, she already knew the answer.

No child could accidentally get the phone number of two random people who happened to be a couple.

I shook my head, my voice shaky. “Ma’am, they are Ruby’s mom and dad now.”

Linda took me home with her.

She lived in a small, two-bedroom apartment.

That tiny spare room became my temporary bedroom.

Linda bought me thick new clothes, cooked me a bowl of steaming hot noodles, and even added two eggs.

I stared at the noodles.

My mom used to tell me that you always ate longevity noodles on your birthday.

But I’d never had them.

Did my mom… not want me to live long?

I gripped the chopsticks, desperately holding back tears.

Suddenly, a warm hand rested on the top of my head.

“Don’t cry.”

“Happy birthday.”

I looked up in surprise.

Linda sighed and held her phone out to me.

I couldn’t read all the words, but I recognized the number that had sent the text message: it was my dad’s.

Linda read the words out loud, her voice flat:

“Dear Madam, today is Daisy’s birthday. We claimed to have drunk Forget-Me-Juice and kicked her out of the house.”

“On the surface, it’s a prank, but in reality, it is to train her ability to live independently. We ask that you not interfere.”
