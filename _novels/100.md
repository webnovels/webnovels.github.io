I married the young, handsome billionaire, but on our wedding night, he didn't touch me.

He said, "I want to save our precious first time for the most beautiful day."

But even after more than ten years of marriage, my husband still hadn't touched me once.

I initially thought he had some embarrassing medical issue and spent years helping him seek treatment, but to no avail.

It wasn't until I saw Derek Starr in Hawaii, arm-in-arm with my sister, surrounded by a pair of twins who were the spitting image of him and called him "Daddy," that I finally woke up from my delusion.

He didn't have any problems at all. He just wasn't interested in me.

When I opened my eyes again, I had returned to the day I was about to join the wealthy Starr family.

I saw the pink roses that Derek had planted for Sophia, filling the entire living room and our marital bedroom.

But he didn't know that this time, I was going to marry his uncle instead.

The moment the text message was delivered, the phone rang.

The voice on the other end was filled with barely contained magnetic joy: "Good, uncle wants to marry you too."
