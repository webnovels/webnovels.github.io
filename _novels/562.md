When I woke up in the hospital, I suddenly realized I could see a number floating above everyone's head.

The number above my best friend Tiffany's head was 206.

My boyfriend Jason's number was 34.

After a passionate night with Jason when I returned home from the hospital, his number changed to 33.

I realized the numbers represented how many times a person had had sex.

Just as I was thinking this superpower wasn't very useful, I attended Jason's grandfather's birthday party. Jason took my drunk friend Tiffany upstairs to rest. When they came back down, their numbers had changed to 205 and 32.

I turned my head and saw Jason's uncle Ethan coming down the stairs.

The number above his head was... 1683.
