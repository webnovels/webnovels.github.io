After crossing into another world, I stayed by Zane Blackwood's side for ten years.

But in ten attempts to bear his child, each time the baby died because he was protecting his true love.

The first time, just as the egg was born, he heard his beloved Ruby was under attack. Without a word, he transformed and ran off wildly.

Leaving me alone to watch over the lifeless embryo.

The second time, Ruby complained of feeling cold, so he gave away the heated stone bed meant for incubating our egg.

Later, he became the most revered Serpent King of the tribe and promised I would be his most honored queen.

He swore he would give me a child.

But this tenth time, even though the egg had already cracked open, Zane held Ruby in his arms. She was under the influence of an aphrodisiac, and he solemnly vowed:

"Aria, wait for me for three days. Once the poison is cured, I'll return to continue incubating our egg."

I had already waited ten years. But these three days, I was no longer willing to wait.

Later I heard that the Serpent King went mad searching every corner of the beast tribe lands. His scales fell off, his eyes turned blood-red, striking terror into all creatures.

But he could not find me anywhere.
