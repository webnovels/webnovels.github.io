The wedding countdown stood at twenty-two days when I walked in on Liam Hayes and his secretary, Chloe, tangled together, stark naked, in my own bed.

My fury erupted, and I demanded to break up right there, cancelling our long-planned wedding.

Liam fell to his knees, begging me, claiming it was just one drunken mistake with Chloe. He swore I was the only one he ever loved, that I shouldn't negate our ten years together over a single error. My heart softened at his desperate pleas and tear-soaked face, and I decided to give him one more chance.

But three weeks later, he came to me, hand-in-hand with Chloe, clutching a positive pregnancy test.

"Chloe is pregnant, and it's mine. This pregnancy is incredibly difficult for her. If she were to terminate it, she might never be able to conceive again."

"She's still so young, I can't let her carry the stigma of being a home-wrecker. For the wedding, she should be the bride first, just until the baby is born and officially part of the family. Then, we can have an even grander wedding for us."

What he didn't know was that since the night he cheated, Julian Hayes, the scion of a powerful family, had already approached me. He told me he wanted to marry me.

But I, swayed by Liam's sweet talk and manipulative pleas, had rejected Julian.

Julian had proposed a bet to me: whether Liam would actually marry me. If I lost the bet, the price was marrying him instead.
