"For seven years, I lived a life of disguise, elevating my girlfriend to the pinnacle of the design world.

On the night of the prestigious design awards, I planned to reveal my true identity and propose.

Instead, I witnessed her walking onto the stage, hand-in-hand with her business partner.

“Scarlett Johansson's success today is all thanks to me,” Liam Walker declared with an arrogant smile.

She simply nodded, her face lit up, “I wouldn’t be where I am today without him.”

The audience erupted in applause, the flashes of cameras blinding.

I stood hidden in a dark corner, my heart sinking to an all-time low.

Leaving the venue, I made a call. “Cut off all resources supporting Scarlett.”

“And that patent infringement issue? Don’t help her get out of it. Let her face the legal consequences.”"
