Because of his religious devotion, my husband Charles could only break his vows with me once a month.

After each time, he would shake his head in regret, saying he had let down God.

I always thought he didn't enjoy that kind of thing, until he brought home a black exchange student.

At first, he said: "Lena is a follower I met while doing charity work in Africa. Don't overthink it."

Later, he said: "Lena has been poisoned by a tribal love potion. If I don't save her, she'll die."

Finally, he said: "Lena is carrying my child. I plan to transfer our marital home to her. You don't mind, do you?"

I calmly replied: "Of course not. Add another house too, in case it's twins."
