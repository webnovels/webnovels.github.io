It's been ten years since my death, and Rachel, the fiancée I abandoned, has returned to the country as a scam kingpin to expand her operations. Her first target is my family.

After swindling my family out of their property, cutting off their limbs to pay debts, and handing my sister over to a sadist, she's disappointed that I still haven't come to arrest her. Furious, she thinks I must be hiding somewhere again.

Just as she's considering whether to leak photos of my family online to force me out, one of her subordinates informs her, "Boss, he died ten years ago."

"He was caught for dereliction of duty and killed in prison by criminals he'd previously arrested."

"His body is still there. Do you want us to dig it up and desecrate it?"
