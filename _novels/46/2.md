Lucas led me to sit in the center, not even glancing at the woman.

He handed me a glass of juice and gestured for Adam to introduce the woman.

"Luke, Iv- I mean, Ivy, this is my cousin Wendy. She just got back from abroad a couple days ago. She doesn't have many friends here, so I brought her along."

Maybe out of guilt, Adam's voice got quieter as he spoke.

Lucas's face betrayed nothing. He nodded briefly at his blind date before looking away.

"Hi there, may I sit here?" A few minutes later, Wendy sat down next to me, holding a Yorkshire terrier.

Because I had been focused on Lucas, I clearly saw him frown slightly when Wendy sat down.

I'm a bit slow to warm up to people.

Not knowing how to handle the current situation, I just smiled awkwardly.

"I heard your family has a history of royal physicians? Momo's appetite isn't good, could you take a look?"

Healing and saving lives is my family's ancestral teaching.

Ignoring the strange feeling in my heart, I replied seriously:

"Besides poor appetite, does the patient have any other symptoms?"

Wendy laughed and held up the little dog in front of me:

"Here, there's no human patient, just an unwell little dog. It's a life too, Ivy. You wouldn't refuse to help, would you?"

Our family has always been small.

When my grandfather was young, he almost lost his life due to certain circumstances.

After the founding of New China, he lived in hiding for a few years.

But eventually he was called out of retirement to save lives.

In my memory, those who knew my grandfather's background were always very respectful to our family.

Even though I was a girl, once people knew I was the only heir to the Sang family in this generation, they rarely spoke to me like this.

"Wendy! Where are your manners?! Do you know who you're talking to?!" Adam angrily rebuked her, then turned to apologize to me:

"Ivy, I'm so sorry. This girl's been spoiled by the family. Please don't take it to heart."

After I got together with Lucas, his friends basically all asked me to check their parents' pulses.

I once detected a problem with Adam's mother's body when she showed no obvious symptoms.

Although Lucas had already recovered by then, they thought it was all thanks to my grandfather's skills and were half-skeptical of me.

But Adam still took his mother to the hospital for a checkup, out of respect for Lucas.

As a result, they were able to intervene before the lesion became cancerous.

This is why, among Lucas's friends, Adam is so warm towards me.

"Miss Summers doesn't understand medicine, does she? Examining humans and pets are completely different things." I hadn't spoken yet, but Lucas chimed in first.

However, he didn't seem to be taking my side at all, and continued calmly:

"Ivy isn't petty. Miss Summers meant no offense, she won't take it personally."

There had been similar situations before.

When someone badmouthed me behind my back and Lucas overheard, he immediately got physical.

But now? Just because she's his socially-compatible blind date, he can be infinitely tolerant?

"I'm so sorry, Ivy. I was too impulsive. You don't mind, right?" As she spoke, Wendy placed her cool hand on my arm.

A strong feeling of discomfort welled up from the bottom of my heart.

Afraid I might show an odd expression in front of everyone, I quickly stood up:

"I don't mind, but I need to use the restroom. Excuse me."

After adjusting my breathing in the bathroom for a while, I decided to clear things up with Lucas as soon as possible and returned to the private room.

Maybe because I had left in such a hurry earlier, the door wasn't fully closed, and I could hear the voices from inside.

"Luke, even though Wendy's my cousin, I have to be fair. If you want to get back together with her, you should be honest with Ivy. You've been together for so many years, and she even saved your life. If you have any conscience, don't play her for a fool!"
