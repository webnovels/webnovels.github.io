But no one could hear my silent plea. All that answered me was Genevieve’s cold voice.

“Marcus, you’re still too soft-hearted. We’ve planned for so long, all for this very day. We can’t fall short now.”

“Have you forgotten how Adrian snatched everything from you? If it weren’t for his mother, your illegitimate status wouldn’t have been exposed, your mother wouldn’t have died, you would have married the woman you loved, and you wouldn’t have been cast out of the Sterling family!”

“Don’t worry. Once this is all over, I’ll compensate Adrian properly.”

I trembled violently, my limbs numb and convulsing, as if a thousand needles were piercing my body.

The metallic taste of blood filled my mouth, and I swallowed a mouthful of bitter, sweet liquid.

Genevieve, I don’t want your compensation!

Just let me out, and I’ll willingly give up my position as heir. I’ll go far away, never to disturb you again!

Marcus seemed to be crying, his voice choked.

“Genevieve, you’re so good to me. Every time I’m sad or upset, you deliberately provoke Veronica, making her abuse Adrian, and even having her send me photos and videos.”

“Watching Adrian beaten and bruised, begging on his knees, or seeing him locked in that closet for three days and three nights, dehydrated from hunger… it always makes me feel so much better.”

Genevieve pulled Marcus into a tight embrace, sighing.

“As long as you’re happy, hurting Adrian a thousand, ten thousand times is worth it. He owes you this.”

Inside the coffin, my tears streamed down, soaking the wood.

My heart felt as if it had been struck by a heavy hammer, collapsing inward.

Genevieve, is this how you’ve always seen me?

How could anyone be so monstrously cruel?

Every instance of abuse, it turned out, had been orchestrated by you.

You were so gentle with me, yet behind my back, you used videos and photos of my torment to please another man.

I laughed silently, tears tracing paths down my face, dripping onto the coffin lid, instantly absorbed.

Perhaps it was the sheer agony, but a surge of unprecedented strength coursed through my body.

My fingers could move!

No matter how much I hated these two vile people, all I wanted right now was to live!

My fingernails scraped against the coffin lid beneath me, emitting a faint scratching sound.

I desperately hoped they would hear the commotion from inside.

The next second, my hope was shattered.

The sound of passionate kissing erupted outside.

I could feel a man being pressed against the coffin, his back pressed tightly against the wood.

I hammered my fingers against the wood, desperately.

But the two outside, lost in their passion, heard nothing.

Their mingled gasps and moans, their bodies slamming against the coffin, made it creak incessantly.

My desperate pleas for help were easily drowned out.

The woman moved rhythmically, whispering her adoration.

“Marcus, do you know how long I’ve waited for this day? To finally have you give up Veronica and agree to marry me.”

“For you, I forced myself to stomach the disgust of seducing Adrian. That night with him, all I could think about was your face.”

I closed my eyes, gritting my teeth, forcing myself not to listen to those nauseating sounds outside.

I thought my will to survive outweighed my hatred for them.

I was wrong. I hated them. So much.

As much as I had loved Genevieve, I hated her now.

And I hated myself even more, for falling in love with two women who both hurt me so wantonly.

I don’t know how much time passed, but finally, it grew quiet outside.

Just as I was despairing, waiting to die, the coffin suddenly opened a crack.
