Darkness suffocated me, and my heart clenched in agonizing spasms.

So, it was Genevieve who made Veronica abuse me. Then she came to pursue me, making me believe that if I wanted to be with her, I had to fake my death and give up everything.

This woman, who promised to marry me, was going to bury me alive and then marry Marcus.

But I woke up early, and there was absolutely nothing in that coffin! No water, no food!

The cramped, suffocating space stole my breath.

Genevieve’s voice sounded muffled through the wooden planks, yet it pierced me like a sharp blade, pinning me irrevocably to the coffin floor.

“Five years ago, when Marcus’s illegitimate status was exposed, his engagement to Veronica was broken off and passed to his brother, Adrian. Marcus lost his love, so I promised him I’d help him gain power and status. I vowed to be his unwavering support.”

“As for Adrian, these past few years, to punish him, I had Veronica torment him physically. Now, letting him leave is a form of release. He loves me so much; he’ll be forever lost in the sweet delusion I’d spun for him.”

The person beside her hesitated, a hint of pity in their voice.

“But Adrian didn’t know he’d actually be buried alive. Burying someone alive for seven full days… it’s too risky. And Mr. Sterling is so afraid of the dark, he has claustrophobia. What if something goes wrong in the coffin…?”

“Nothing will!”

Genevieve’s words allowed no room for doubt.

“The Sterlings are thorough; we have to make this charade absolutely convincing. It’s only seven days. In reality, he’ll only be conscious for two. What could go wrong? Besides, Veronica promised me she’d lock him in the closet every time she finished beating him. He should be used to it by now.”

“Marcus waited five years for this opportunity. We must ensure everything is foolproof. Once the dust settles and Marcus and I are married, we’ll get a fake marriage certificate abroad to deceive Adrian. We’ll keep him well-fed and comfortable, making sure he can never return.”

The footsteps faded. I tried with all my might but couldn't make a sound.

The faux-death drug kept my mind clear, but my body was unresponsive, unable to speak.

My claustrophobia flared, a cold sweat drenching my back. I bit my tongue, forcing myself to calm down.

The absolute pitch black reminded me of the five years I’d been married to Veronica.

Every time she abused me, she’d lock me in a closet.

The painful memories flooded me, a tide of torment, and my stomach churned.

Two years ago, I was locked in that closet again. It was Genevieve who saved me.

The moment she opened that closet door, she seemed like an angel, capable of dispelling all the darkness in my life.

From then on, Genevieve relentlessly pursued me.

She cared for my bruised body, comforted my broken heart, and urged me to bravely resist Veronica’s abuse.

How foolish I was to believe I’d found my salvation.

Little did I know that all the torment I endured was instigated by Genevieve herself!

She orchestrated Veronica to hurt me, while she played the role of a good Samaritan, healing me.

And all of it was for my brother, Marcus.

I bit down hard on my lip, trying desperately to make my body move.

Suddenly, I heard a door open outside.

Marcus’s voice, accompanied by the sound of men’s dress shoes, drifted closer.

“Genevieve, burying Adrian underground for seven days… will he truly be alright? The burial is today. He is my brother, after all. I still feel it’s too cruel.”

I felt like I’d grasped a lifeline, screaming helplessly in my mind:

*Save me!*

*Please, just open the coffin and take a look. One glance is all it would take to see I’m awake.*

*I don’t want to be buried alive, don’t want to experience the agony of suffocating in the dark!*
