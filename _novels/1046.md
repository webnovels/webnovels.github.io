During my daughter, Nadia Payne's, birthday party, she leaned toward the candles and made a wish in Jirnum. "I hope Ms. Carton can be my mom this year."

My husband, Zachary Payne, smiled and ruffled her hair. "Your wish will come true very soon."

I froze. The cake slipped right out of my hands and fell to the floor.

Zachary looked at me, concerned. "What's wrong?"

I shook my head quickly and smiled. "I lost my grip, that's all."

The truth was, I understood the Jirnum language. Panic hit me so hard I couldn't even hold onto the cake.

It seemed Zachary had forgotten I grew up in Jirnumia and only returned for university. Back then, he even learned Jirnum just to get closer to me after finding out I spoke it. I was also the one who taught my daughter Jirnum.

Now, Zachary wiped the floor clean with a towel before cutting another slice of cake and holding it out to feed me. "It's fine. I'll feed you if you can't hold it."

This time, I didn't take it. Instead, I took a step back. "I don't feel like eating."

Nadia stuffed a huge bite into her mouth and puffed her cheeks. "I'm still right here, you know. Can you two stop being lovey-dovey for one second?"

She was five and still had her baby fat. Her facial features were almost identical to Zachary's—delicate and striking.

Zachary pulled me into his embrace right in front of our daughter, raising a brow. "Loving my wife is what I do every day. You'll have to get used to it, sweetheart."

Nadia set down her cake on the table and jogged straight into my arms. "No way. It's my birthday today. Mommy belongs to me today."

She hugged me tightly, but I didn't smile and ruffle her hair like I always do. 

Nadia noticed instantly. She tilted her head up, her expression helpless as she asked, "Mommy, why aren't you hugging me? Are you teaming up with Daddy to pick on me?"

Zachary burst into laughter, but I looked at her and said calmly, "I was just wondering if my daughter and husband, who seem to love me so much, might actually love someone else more."

For a beat, Nadia froze in place. "Mommy, what are you talking about?"

Zachary's smile disappeared. When he lifted his gaze, he looked soft but weary. He took my hand and rubbed it gently. "Yeah. The person both Nadia and I love most is you. Why would you think otherwise?"

I slid my hand out of his grasp. Even now, they still insisted on lying. They had forgotten that I hated deception.

When Zachary and I got married, I told him that if he ever lied to me, even a little, I would leave him for good. He made a vow in front of everyone, saying he would remain loyal to me for life. After all, I would return to Jirnumia and never see him again.

However, now I didn't even know how long he had been cheating. Even the daughter I treasured most had already taken another woman's side. Five years of nurturing and sacrifice were gone in an instant.

I thought I would break down, scream, and fight. To my own surprise, I was calm. Calm enough to think clearly about what I should do next.

I forcefully pulled my daughter away from me. "I'm tired. You two can enjoy the rest of the party."
