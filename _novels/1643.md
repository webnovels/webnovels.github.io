The city's golden boy, the heir to the Lindenlaub empire, announced he was joining a monastery, leaving me standing alone at the altar.
The socialites all placed their bets: I’d be kicked to the curb before the season was over.
But to everyone's shock, my new husband, Jake Lindenlaub, shed his celibate persona and spent our nights tangled in passionate embraces.
Just as the world decided I was the siren who had lured the saint from his pedestal, I overheard a conversation between him and his friends.
"Your wife is adorable, completely clueless," one of them drawled. "Three years, seven different guys, and she hasn't suspected a thing. She actually thinks you're just a master of variety in the bedroom."
Another laughed. "You're never home during the day, and she still makes you dinner. Doesn't question a thing."
Jake Lindenlaub chuckled, tapping the ash from his cigarette. "She's a small-town girl. Sheltered. She has no idea how we play in the city. Easily impressed."
The man who had been with me just last night corrected him. "Don't talk about her like that. She's just... innocent."
My lover from the month before that chimed in. "Yeah, she's sweet. I had a headache once and she gave me a massage."
Jake's face darkened.
"You guys can stop coming over," he said, his voice flat. "My mother wants a grandchild."
I glanced down at the flimsy lingerie I was wearing.
And sighed.
Jake Lindenlaub has seven brothers. I still had one to go.

City boys play rough.
On our wedding night, the prince of Manhattan's elite not only insisted the lights be off, but he also blindfolded me with a silk tie.
He had dismissed all the servants from the villa. My wedding dress, tiara, and shoes were scattered in a trail from the grand staircase to the master bedroom. Two antique vases were casualties of our chaotic journey.
In the pitch-black, I couldn't see a thing, but my hands found his abs. They were spectacular.
"Jake, be gentle..."
This one was built like a god. He wrapped an arm around me from behind, covering my mouth with one hand while his own mouth was busy leaving a trail of love bites along my shoulder.
The next morning, I single-handedly debunked the rumors of Jake Lindenlaub's asceticism.
I limped so badly I had to skip the formal post-wedding brunch with his mother.
In an instant, the news that Jake Lindenlaub had fallen from grace spread like wildfire. I became the talk of the town.
My sister called me in a panic from across the ocean. "So? How was it?"
I was busy applying concealer to a particularly vicious mark on my shoulder. "Seven rounds. Nothing special."
The truth was, I knew it wasn't Jake on our wedding night.
While he thought I was asleep, he'd taken a call by the bed, his fingers toying with a lock of my hair. "Can't leave now, she just cried herself to sleep."
"What are you worried about? It's not like your parents are going to come inspect the sheets."
"She's a simple one. Didn't suspect a thing."
After he hung up, I waited a few calculated seconds before "sleepwalking" my way into his arms, my hands exploring freely. I knew this man couldn't resist a bit of teasing. And since he wasn't my man, every touch was a bonus.
My motto: a good deal is a terrible thing to waste.
After six months, I was getting bored.
While this brother was away on a business trip, I decided to harass the real Jake with a video call.
He picked up on the tenth try.
"What is it?"
That was the real Jake Lindenlaub. Cold, distant, and perpetually annoyed by my very existence. He had never once set foot in our marital home.
I feigned ignorance, my voice a playful purr. "Last night, you said you were going to absolutely wreck me. Why aren't you home yet?"
I was sprawled on the pillows, my eyes red-rimmed. "I feel so... needy. And this floor-to-ceiling window has a perfect view of the city lights. Do you think anyone's ever watched us?"
"I want to play piano on your back again. You're so good at it."
Jake wasn't looking at the screen, but I could see the color drain from his face. "Shut up. Don't talk about that during the day."
See? It was his own kinky idea, but even he felt the phantom weight of cuckold horns when it was said out loud.
I wasn't done. "You promised. If you don't come back, I'll just come to your office. I don't mind an audience. You have thirty minutes."
I had been dying to meet the rest of his brothers.
To get rid of me, Jake promised he would be home that night. Of course, he wouldn't be coming.
So, half an hour later, the lights in the villa went out once again.
And in walked a sunny, athletic type.
For three years, the lingerie in my closet was in a constant cycle of being bought, worn, and torn.

Jake was right. I was just a poor girl from a small town.
The only reason I married him was a stroke of dumb luck. His mother adored me, his grandparents loved me, and they all said I had a "lucky aura." They promised me a stake in the family company if I married him.
Of course, being ridiculously charming is a skill in itself. I admit it, I'm a professional.
At first, I didn't want to marry him. I just figured a man that wealthy couldn't possibly be clean. As for all that talk about being a celibate monk? I didn't buy it for a second.
A man's virginity is the greatest dowry.
My sister nearly slapped me. "Are you a virgin?"
I shook my head. I’d had four or five boyfriends.
"Then what's with the double standard?! You're going to sleep with someone eventually, why not sleep with Jake Lindenlaub? He's rich, he's gorgeous, his family loves you. Try it out for a few years. If it doesn't work, you can always get a divorce!"
"And if he actually becomes a monk? Even better! Your in-laws love you, your wallet is full, and your husband isn't even home to annoy you. Only an idiot would turn this down!"
"A trust fund is a hell of a lot sexier than a 401(k), isn't it?"
And just like that, a small-town girl hit the jackpot.
I endured the judgmental stares of high society, ate six-figure meals that left me hungry, and wore shoes that couldn't get wet. I watched as seven-figure sums were deposited into my bank account every day.
My life, a bleak, desolate wasteland. Oh, the tragedy.
I was suffering so much. Was it really too much to ask for him to send a few of his brothers to comfort me?
I considered it fair compensation.
Jake had seven close friends—a band of brothers. In three years, I had slept with six of them. I was an equal-opportunity lover, giving each man a solid six-month run.
Just as I was getting tired of the current one and plotting how to switch to the next, it was my mother-in-law's birthday. I was summoned back to the family estate.
She eyed my flat stomach with a sigh. "Three years and still no news. That boy Jake is really useless."
"He's just very diligent with protection," I offered.
"You're still using it?"
I nodded solemnly. The city boys might play rough, but they weren't stupid enough to play with fire.
Jake and I were rarely seen together in public. In fact, we had barely ever met.
The main hall was crowded, so I took a tray of drinks upstairs, hoping to hide out in Jake's study. But as I approached the door, I heard a cynical laugh from inside.
"That small-town girl is so naive. Three years, and she still hasn't caught on? Jake, your family picked a real winner for you. So pure."
I knew that voice. It belonged to one of Jake's brothers. I used to love hearing it whisper in my ear.
"The old folks really know what they're doing. A girl like that... almost makes me want to get one of my own."
There were nine men in the study, lounging in various states of casual arrogance—leaning against walls, sprawled on sofas, perched on desks. It was a sea of long legs and devastatingly handsome faces.
"So, who do you guys think is her favorite?"
I held my breath, my grip tightening on the tray.
Damn, I was good.
I assumed they were deciding who was next on the roster. My money was on the youngest of the group, a kid named Noah. He was still in college, all innocent charm and blushing cheeks. He called me "ma'am" and would turn bright red if I so much as smiled at him. I could make him cry in three minutes flat.
But then Jake, who had been silent until now, sat up. He tapped the ash from his cigarette, his expression unreadable. "No need. My mother is pushing for a grandchild."
His brother was stunned. "So you're giving in? I thought you swore off women forever."
"My mother was just diagnosed with a heart condition. She doesn't have much time left. She wants to see her grandchild."
Damn. What a buzzkill.

So, no Noah, and my celibate husband was coming home. A double whammy of disappointment.
I stood outside the bedroom, looking pathetic, and checked my phone. A seven-figure deposit notification popped up. A smile instantly bloomed on my face as I walked in.
"Darling, I've missed you so much!"
Jake was impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, his cufflinks sparkling. A pair of gold-rimmed glasses rested on his aristocratic nose, and a string of prayer beads was wrapped around his wrist. He really did look like a saint.
He was sitting on the sofa, reading a book. His eyes flicked up, scanning me from head to toe.
"Go take a shower."
If I wasn't mistaken, the book in his hand was mine. The last brother had used it as a coaster.
I cursed silently under my breath, grabbed a silk nightgown, and headed for the bathroom.
The real Jake was no slouch. He was just as handsome and well-built as the others. This was the first time I'd seen him up close. As he leaned over me, his features were sharp and defined, his lips thin and sensual, his lashes long and dark. The man radiated pure, unadulterated sex appeal.
If it weren't for the fact that, as he pressed down on me, his hands were suddenly snapped into a pair of handcuffs attached to the headboard, I probably wouldn't have burst out laughing.
Now, Jake was half-curled on the bed, his face a thundercloud.
"You play these games often?"
He clearly had no idea what his brothers had been up to in his villa. As he struggled, the chains on the cuffs tightened.
I poked my finger into his cheek, feigning surprise. "Don't you remember? You bought these for me."
"You don't need me to unlock them, do you?"
I adjusted my robe, batting my eyelashes innocently. "You said you had a surprise for me the other day. I can't believe it was this. You're making me blush."
Jake's face grew even darker.
His best friend...
...in his marital home...
...gave his wife...
...a very special gift.
A gift that he had now received, and couldn't get off.
"I guess you're not in the mood to play tonight."
I fought back a wave of hysterical laughter, wiped away a non-existent tear, and climbed over him. "I'll just sleep in the guest room then. Don't worry about me. I'm not afraid of sleeping alone. Really."
"Wait!" Jake gritted out. "Do me a favor."
Of course, I didn't unlock him.
I just tossed him his phone.
I'd considered keeping it, but if he died and it was blamed on me, my bank account might suffer. All that money, left to the whims of strangers? Unacceptable.
Jake called for help. Half an hour later, a luxury car pulled up to the villa.
I opened the door. The night wind felt cool against my neck.
Leo, the sixth brother, took a deep breath. Last night, in the dark, he had promised to make me cry. Tonight, he was here to unlock his best friend. The phone call between them must have been excruciating.
As I was heading up the stairs, I stumbled. Leo's hand shot out, steadying me by the waist.
"Careful, baby."
I regained my balance and shot him a look. "What did you just call me?"
He quickly retracted his hand, clearing his throat. "Ma'am."
The man who had spent nights whispering "baby" in my ear now couldn't even spare me a second glance. The injustice of it all.
I didn't call him out. "Are you a locksmith or something?"
"What?"
I pushed open the bedroom door. Jake was still trapped on the bed, his face like stone, the chains rattling as he clenched his fists.
I pointed at the cold metal on his wrists. "For that."

In the dead silence between the two brothers, my feigned ignorance was a work of art. A poor, sheltered girl from a small town. What would I know?
Leo followed the instructions and finally freed Jake.
The two best friends stood in stony silence.
My phone rang, shattering the tension.
I hung up. "I have a client for a manicure. I have to go."
When you have too much money, you start wanting to "experience life." In other words, you invent hardships for yourself. I had opened a nail salon. Business was slow, but I had a few loyal customers.
Jake clearly had things to discuss with Leo. He tossed me his car keys and told me to take his car.
As I headed to the garage, I could hear the sounds of a fight breaking out upstairs.
"You went too fucking far!"
"You're the one who wanted to be a monk! You're blaming me?!"
Who won, who lost? I couldn't care less.
The sea breeze was refreshing. I sat in my private cabana by the beach, my toolkit open, a rainbow of polish bottles laid out.
I held a man's hand in mine, his fingers long and elegant. I carefully applied a coat of shimmering polish. Seeing a speck of dust, I gently blew it away.
The man's body tensed. "You're a hard woman to book an appointment with."
I worked on each nail meticulously. "I'm the owner. You're lucky to get me once a month."
I placed a tiny pink heart sticker on his middle finger. "Like it?"
I looked up and met his intense gaze. He was watching me.
Suddenly, he covered my eyes with his hand. His lips, warm and soft, pressed against mine. "Sera, I'm a man. I don't care about the manicure."
This was Ethan, the first brother. The muscular one, lean and powerful but not intimidating.
After three minutes, I pushed him away and slapped him.
Ouch. My hand stung.
"My name is Seraphina."
"I know!"
Ethan stared at me for a moment, then took my reddened hand and gently blew on it. "That must have hurt. I remember you don't like pain."
Dude, it's a little late for that now.
I'm not one to go back for seconds.
I made an excuse and left.
Ethan followed me. "Jake has always hated women. He swore he was going to be a monk. As his wife, you must have suffered a lot. But I'm different. You were happy with me, weren't you?"
I stopped. Against the light, he looked even more handsome. I could never bring myself to be mean to a handsome man.
I took a few more steps and stopped again. From this angle, he wasn't nearly as attractive.
I slapped him again, decisively.
"I don't know what you're talking about! You're just a client. I'm a married woman. Please have some respect and stay away from me!"
What a joke. I was the victim here. Did he really think I was going to have an honest conversation with him? Not a chance.
Ethan tried to soothe my hand again. I snatched it away, turned on my thousand-dollar heels, clutched my forty-thousand-dollar Chanel bag, and stormed off to my million-dollar Ferrari.
And came face-to-face with a stone-cold Jake.
His fingers were tapping on the steering wheel, a tell-tale sign of his displeasure. "Have you been in contact with him this whole time?"
He had just been in a fight with Leo. A fresh bruise on his cheek made his already severe face look even more menacing.
