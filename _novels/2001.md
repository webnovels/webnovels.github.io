The week before New Year's Eve, I realized my boyfriend had become a different person. It wasn't just his habits that had changed; he seemed more mature, more grounded.
Even his hobbies were different. He was suddenly into artisanal teas and wellness, no longer obsessed with extreme sports.
In bed, he was… reserved. Almost disciplined. Never greedy.
I thought he'd finally grown up, that he was ready to settle down with me and build a future, done with the usual parade of party girls.
But then I came home early to surprise him for his birthday and overheard him on the phone.
"Bro, just keep Aria steady for a little while longer. I'll be back in a bit. Thanks for covering for me."
My boyfriend's voice replied, "It's fine. By the way, what brand of condoms do you usually use? I think Aria is allergic to everything I've tried."
Hearing that, my breath hitched. So, the changes weren't my imagination. Without me knowing, my boyfriend’s twin brother had quietly clocked in for his shift.

1.
The voice on the other end—Declan's voice—stuttered. "Bro, why are you asking that? We don't usually use them. She's on the pill."
"Just curious," Rhys, the man in my apartment, replied.
"Is she giving you a hard time? Women are like that, always needy. Just ignore her. Give her the cold shoulder for a few days, and she'll fall in line." Even though Declan was confident his brother wouldn't be interested in me, a hint of unease crept into his voice. "Bro, maybe you should move out. The less you see her, the better. We can just coordinate online. Sloane insisted I take this trip with her, and we’re still on the road."
Rhys’s voice was low. "I know."
I stood in the shadows, holding my breath. So, Declan was on a trip with Sloane.
It was almost funny. They swore there was nothing between them, that they were just "best friends." Yet he would rather have his twin brother live alone with his girlfriend than miss a secret vacation with Sloane.
The truth of it left my mind a blank slate. My first instinct was to flee, but in my haste, I bumped into the robotic vacuum cleaner on the floor.
The living room light flicked on.
Rhys’s eyes found me instantly.
My heart leaped into my throat. I forced myself to look at him, to really observe him. He was different from Declan. Rhys’s gaze was deep, unreadable. Declan’s eyes always had a mischievous glint, constantly calculating his next lie.
Just as I thought he was about to blow his cover, he simply said, "Is that cake for me?"
I lifted the box. Declan's name was written on it in frosted icing.
Before I could speak, he took it from my hands. "Thank you. I love it. I almost forgot it was my birthday."
Of course. They were twins. It was his birthday, too.
"Happy birthday," I heard myself say.
Rhys closed the distance between us and wrapped his arms around my rigid body, his lips gently brushing against mine.
I took a sharp breath. I didn't know when they'd switched, but in the time since, he and I had done… everything.
My heart hammered against my ribs. I fumbled in my pocket and pulled out his gift.
"For you."
It was a tie, a ridiculously expensive one. The color was bright, flashy—a color Declan loved, but one I doubted Rhys would ever choose for himself.
Yet he opened it without a change in expression, took my hand, and guided me to tie it around his neck. His large hand rested on the small of my back, his touch sending shivers through me as his eyes darkened with a familiar hunger.
"…"
Wait, wasn't this the guy who was into "wellness" and self-restraint?
The next thing I knew, he was carrying me into the bedroom, his kisses peppering my skin. He used the new tie to gently bind my wrists above my head. I started to struggle, but his next words stopped me cold.
"I took one of your birth control pills. So this time, you won't have a reaction."

2.
The first time I suspected something was wrong with "Declan" was when he suddenly started using condoms. That was completely out of character.
It started as a nagging suspicion, but then things got worse. Sex, which had always been great, suddenly became painful.
I picked a huge fight with him over it. The next morning, I woke up covered in a painful, swollen rash. I was convinced he’d done something weird and stormed into his office to confront him.
It was only later that I found out I was allergic to the latex.
After that, "Declan" didn't touch me for a week. He was incredibly attentive, personally applying cream to the rash. This pampered rich boy, who had never set foot in a kitchen, actually started cooking for me. The day I saw him making me soup, I was genuinely terrified. In all my years with the real Declan, he’d never so much as boiled water.
At the time, I thought it was a sign he was finally changing, the playboy settling down. I never imagined the man himself wasn't the original model.
Once the rash cleared up, Rhys tried a different type of condom.
I had another allergic reaction, though milder this time. The look on his face when he saw the rash was thunderous. I braced myself for an outburst, but instead, he just said, "I'm sorry. I'll be more careful."
I was speechless. In all my time being mistreated by the arrogant real Declan, I had never once heard him apologize.
"It's… it's okay…"
Rhys pulled me into a tender embrace, his lips finding mine. I melted into the kiss, my head spinning. At the same time, a thought drifted through my mind: When did Declan get so good at kissing?
It wasn't that he was better, just… gentler. The real Declan used to bite. Especially my collarbone. It hurt like hell.
Day by day, Rhys's every action drew me in more. On weekends, he no longer disappeared to clubs with his "girlfriends." Instead, he’d hold me in his lap and teach me calligraphy, his warm breath tickling my ear as he guided my hand. His voice was a low murmur that made my heart pound.
No! If this continues, I'm going to actually fall for him.
Loving the real Declan was a losing game. It was all about his money and his face, nothing more.
But this man seemed determined to make me fall. When I was working, he’d massage my shoulders. When I was relaxing, he’d hold me close. Even in bed, he was never forceful. Afterwards, no matter how late it was, he would gently clean me up.
I was so overwhelmed by the change that I had to debrief with my friends. Their verdict was unanimous.
"He's in love with you! He wants to marry you!"
Hearing that, I'll admit, I was thrilled. But was it really possible? Could a serial cheater, a man who flirted with anything that moved, truly change his ways?
Now I knew the answer. No. Not only would he not change, he'd literally sell his own girlfriend out.
The man who had been so good to me was Rhys.
Declan's twin brother.
A bitter taste filled my mouth. But hey, if this was his choice, who was I to complain?

The next morning, I woke up in Rhys’s arms, our naked skin pressed together. His perfectly sculpted chest was right under my palm. I swallowed hard.
Rhys, his eyes still closed, nuzzled my cheek. "You're awake," he murmured, his voice husky with sleep. "Hungry?"
As if on cue, my stomach growled.
A smile touched Rhys's lips. He sat up, wrapped me in the duvet, and scooped me into his arms. I looped my arms around his neck. "Baby, will you love me forever?" I cooed, playing the part.
He was a natural liar, not even blinking. "Of course I will."
He carried me to the bathroom, brushed my teeth for me, and dressed me. Breakfast, a lavish spread he'd had delivered, was already waiting.
I sat at the table, watching him. "Declan, you know, you've changed a lot lately."
His fingers froze for a split second. "Oh? How so? Changed in a way you like better?" he asked, mimicking Declan's playful tone, his eyes dancing.
It was the same face, but the feeling was completely different.
"You were never this gentle before."
His long eyelashes fluttered. He brought my hand to his lips and kissed my wrist. "Baby, I just want to make things better for you."
You can't provoke a man, especially by comparing him to another. The moment I put my fork down, he swept me up and carried me back to the bedroom. If it weren't for the fact that his hand was already sliding under my shirt, his serious expression might have convinced me he had business to attend to.
"Is this better, or was it better before?" he asked, his voice strained.
I closed my eyes, feigning concentration. "Now is better, definitely better."
His hand tightened on my waist, a drop of sweat falling from his forehead onto my cheek.
When it was over, I lay in bed, scrolling on my phone. Rhys went to take a shower.
His phone, left on the nightstand, buzzed. A message from Declan popped up on the screen.
[Bro, how are things with Aria? Has she suspected anything?]
[Bro, I'll try to be back soon. I got you a gift.]
Below it was a picture. Two hands, Declan's and Sloane's, pressed together, holding a pink crystal rose.
[Bro, isn't this crystal gorgeous? If you like it, I'll bring one back for you.]
Declan's hands were identical to Rhys's, right down to the lines on his palm.
A wicked smile spread across my face. I tapped out a reply.
[Who's this? My boyfriend's in the shower.]
There was a long pause from the other end.
A second later, the bathroom door flew open. Rhys emerged, a towel wrapped around his waist. He saw me with his phone and rushed over.
"Someone keeps calling you 'bro'," I said innocently. "Who is he?"
Rhys masked the complex emotions in his eyes. "He's the neighbor's kid."
I suppressed a laugh. I wondered how Declan would feel knowing his own brother had demoted him to the kid next door.
"He said he's bringing you a gift. That crystal is really pretty."
Rhys pulled me into a hug, kissing my cheek. "I'll buy you one, honey."
And as he held me, I slipped the tiny listening device I'd bought to catch Declan cheating into his pocket. The deal had been fifty grand for every time I caught him.
The phone in Rhys's hand started buzzing incessantly.
I guessed Declan was starting to panic. A few seconds later, it rang. A call.
Rhys pulled away. "I've got to take this. You get some rest."
I watched him go, the smile slowly fading from my eyes.

"Bro, what are you and Aria doing? Why did she just message me from your phone?"
Out in the hallway, Rhys listened to Declan’s suspicious tone, his own voice perfectly calm. "My clothes were dirty, so I was taking a shower."
Declan audibly relaxed. "Oh, is that it? Good. I was thinking of cutting the trip short anyway. I'll be back tomorrow."
Rhys didn't say anything.
Declan suddenly sounded anxious. "Bro, I think I'm done playing around. Being out here made me realize how good Aria is. You'd be okay with me marrying her, right?" The question was laced with a desperate, thinly veiled attempt to gauge Rhys's feelings.
"Of course. If that's what you both want."
Declan let out a huge sigh of relief. What was he thinking? Rhys had seen all kinds of women; why would he ever be interested in a woman his own brother had slept with? He felt foolish for even suspecting him. After a few more pleasantries, Declan made an excuse and hung up.
When Rhys came back, I found an opportunity to retrieve the bug.
"Declan, what happened?" I asked, my face a mask of innocence. "You look so preoccupied."
Rhys cupped my face, his voice low. "Aria, will you stay with me forever?"
"Of course I will."
"And do you like me now, or the way I was before?" he pressed, even though he'd asked the same question just three hours ago.
My lips curved into a small smile. "I like them both."
I wasn't about to give him a straight answer. If Rhys decided this game was over, I could still go back to Declan. But if he wanted to keep playing, the pressure was all on him.
Just as I predicted, my answer left him looking lost. He pulled me into a tight hug, as if clutching something he was about to lose. The moment was charged with a desperate longing, and soon we were kissing again, a tangle of limbs and soft murmurs. He unzipped my dress, his body pressing me down onto the bed.
But the next second, the doorbell rang.
The carefully constructed atmosphere shattered.
This apartment was a gift from Declan. No one else would just show up unannounced. There was only one possibility.
Declan was back. Ahead of schedule.
And the room, littered with the evidence of our afternoon, was not fit for company.
I looked up at Rhys. He swallowed hard. "I'll get it."
Sooner or later, this had to happen.
He opened the door. Declan stood there, still in his hiking gear. The smile on his face vanished the moment he saw the rose petals scattered across the floor.
I looked straight at him. "Oh, you must be Declan's brother," I said sweetly. "Can I help you?"
I knew Declan had a twin.
A pained, forced smile stretched across Declan's face, but his eyes burned with rage. Aria hadn't even recognized him. Did he mean anything to her at all?
"I'm here to see him," Declan ground out, his gaze fixed on Rhys. "We need to talk. Outside." His fists were clenched at his sides.
I smiled, adding more fuel to the fire. I wrapped my arms around Rhys's arm and kissed his cheek. "Honey, come back soon. I'll be waiting for you."
In less than a second, Rhys shoved me away.
Declan's fist connected with his face.
I let out a theatrical shriek. "What are you doing? Don't hit my boyfriend!"
