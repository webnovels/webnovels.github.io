Chapter 1
Summer of 1983, Princeton University, Teacher's Office.

"Mr. Derek, I've made up my mind. I plan to study, but I’m giving up my spot at Princeton University for the decryption program at MIT."

The autumn wind carried a chill as Cyril, with his slender frame, stood tall, his eyes unusually resolute.

Derek paused for a moment, then exclaimed in overwhelming joy,
"Cyril, you’ve finally come to your senses! I thought you were giving up your Princeton spot to your cousin just so you could marry Natalie. But the decryption program at MIT is very special—it requires you to conceal your identity and live under an alias. Have you discussed this with your family?"

"No need to discuss. I can make this decision myself."

Cyril's eyes flickered with pain when he heard the word "family," but it quickly passed. Perhaps, once he was completely out of their world, he would no longer have anything to lose.

It was all because his uncle had drowned in the river while saving him. His parents took in his cousin, claiming that Cyril owed him his life and should learn to be humble.

To make up for their guilt, his parents gave all their good things to his cousin, even falling in love with his fiancée.

Both family and love had been taken away from him.

Now, in order to take his college spot, his parents forced him to agree, and Natalie even suggested exchanging it for a marriage certificate.

Cyril had spent the whole night thinking on his small balcony bed, and finally realized the truth.

This time, he wouldn’t yield. Instead, he chose to sever ties with them, no longer wanting any part in their lives.

The red maples blazed like fire, and as Cyril walked down the cold street, his back seemed lonely. The workers, dressed in blue, were heading home, riding their bicycles with happy smiles on their faces.

The bustling world felt completely out of place for him.

A jeep pulled up beside him, blocking his path.

"Get in!"

The window rolled down, revealing a cold, pretty face. Natalie looked impatient.
"Did you explain everything to the school?"

Cyril remained silent.

He had explained everything, but not in the way Natalie had wanted. Instead of giving up his Princeton spot, he was going somewhere she would never find.

Before Cyril could respond, Antonin leaned his head out from the back seat, waving a large bundle of items in his hand.

"Cyril, look! Natalie bought me so many things—clothes, shoes, and even a radio! She said if I go to Princeton, I can’t let anyone look down on me."

Cyril's gaze locked onto the necklace around Antonin's neck, and his expression changed drastically. It felt like his heart had been pierced, with blood rushing to his head.

It was the heirloom his grandmother had left for him, and it was also the token of love meant for Natalie. To his shock, Natalie had given it to Antonin.

Natalie noticed Cyril's gaze and a flash of embarrassment crossed her face, but it quickly returned to calm.
"Antonin likes it. Anyway, it’s not that valuable. After we get the marriage certificate, I’ll buy you something better."

Cyril felt a bitter pang in his heart. The necklace wasn't worth much, but it represented love. Unfortunately, in Natalie's eyes, it had become insignificant.

And that made sense.

Natalie didn’t love him, so she wouldn’t treasure it.

Antonin, hearing the mention of the marriage certificate, showed an exaggerated expression of jealousy, feigning grievance as he cried out,
"Natalie, I think Cyril is upset. Is it because I took his spot at Princeton? I'm sorry, it’s my fault. I shouldn’t have taken his things. I deserve to be unwanted."

Natalie couldn’t stand Antonin being upset. Her face darkened, and she glared fiercely at Cyril.
"Antonin’s life has been tough enough. You have everything—why do you have to compete with him?"

She quickly patted Antonin's head, soothing him.
"Don’t worry. The Princeton spot is yours, no one can take it from you."

"Go home and reflect on yourself. When you’ve figured things out, apologize to Antonin. Otherwise, I won’t forgive you!"

With that, she slammed the gas pedal, leaving a cloud of dust behind.

Antonin on the backseat shot Cyril a smug, taunting look, his face filled with malicious glee.

Cyril coughed violently from the dust, tears streaming down his face.

Look at that.

He said nothing, did nothing, but everything he did was wrong.

Cyril stood motionless for a long time, until a maple leaf fell onto his shoulder. The cold wind bit through his thin clothes. Once, when he had nowhere to go because of his parents' favoritism, it was Natalie who had said, "With me around, the world will never be lacking in love."

But even that woman, who had promised to protect him for a lifetime, had changed her heart.

The sky was overcast, and Cyril wiped the tears from his eyes. He took a big candy out of his pocket and gave a bitter smile.

The candy had been kept for many years—it was a gift from Natalie. She had said that whenever he felt sad, he should eat the candy, and life would feel a little sweeter.

Cyril had always been reluctant to eat it, saving it for the present.

Now, the candy had gone bad, just like Natalie’s love. It had turned into garbage.

Cyril threw the candy into the drain, along with his biased parents and his fickle fiancée. He no longer needed any of them.
