I had dedicated years to figure skating, and to repay the immense sponsorship from the Harrington family, I married Julian Harrington.

In our seven years of marriage, he'd taken on dozens of women, even setting them up in the same exclusive community. His twisted excuse? It made it easier for me, his legitimate wife, to 'manage' them.

I became adept at handling the women he grew tired of, all while maintaining my grueling training schedule.

Just as I was on the brink of winning the Grand Slam, a teammate accidentally grazed my neck with her skate blade during a competition.

Streams of blood dripped onto the ice, freezing into crimson streaks.

Julian merely glanced at me.

“If you’re not dead, then get back on the ice and win!”

Only later did I discover she was Julian’s new favorite. This was her twisted display of power, his warning.

When I regained consciousness, I stared at the familiar room, yet couldn’t recall where I was.

All I knew was that my debt was paid. I could finally leave…
