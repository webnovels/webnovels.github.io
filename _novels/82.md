My best friend and I planned a trip together.

During the journey, I successfully snagged a handsome boyfriend, which drove her insane with jealousy.

She angrily demanded to know: "Didn't we agree to stay single together? Why did you betray me?!"

As soon as we got home, she started spreading vicious rumors about me, saying I was a "budget traveler" who sold myself to fund the trip.

She even photoshopped my pictures and posted secretly taken intimate photos of me all over the internet, eventually driving me to depression and death.

When I woke up again, I had been reborn.
