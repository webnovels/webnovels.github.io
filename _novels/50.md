I woke up after being in a coma for three years.

Upon awakening, I discovered that my boyfriend had a new fiancée, and my parents had a new daughter.

"Aria, let's not bring up our past relationship anymore. It's embarrassing. We were young and foolish back then," Jake said dismissively.

"Sweetie, during these years when you were gone, Chloe has been the one supporting us through everything," my parents cooed.

Seeing the smug smile on Chloe's face, I inwardly sneered.

In my previous life, after learning everything, I couldn't accept it and went mad. I crashed Chloe and Jake's engagement party and was thrown out.

As soon as I left the ceremony venue, I was hit by a car and died.

After my death, my parents and Jake only briefly mourned for me before focusing all their attention on Chloe.

This time, looking at Jake, who seemed a bit at a loss by my hospital bed, I nodded.

"We can break up, but I want compensation!"
