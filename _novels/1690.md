Before signing, the client asked for coconut pastries. I sent my boyfriend Todd to get them.
Unexpectedly, the client bit into one and collapsed from an allergic reaction. Upon waking, he canceled our contract and awarded the million-dollar deal to Anna—the intern who rushed him to the hospital.
Seeing months of hard work handed to someone else was devastating. Todd comforted me, saying it was just bad luck.
Later, though, I overheard him bragging: "The client’s allergic to peaches. Good thing I added peach juice. Now Anna gets the job, a bonus, and her condo down payment."
His friend hesitated. "But Sarah visited 28 cities in 30 days for that project, even with a fever, to pay for her dad’s surgery…"
Todd frowned impatiently. "She has my love. Isn’t that enough? Besides, she owed Anna."
My fists clenched.
So, it wasn’t bad luck—it was his trap. He thought his fake love could mend my broken life and ease his guilt.
Sorry, Todd. This ungrateful snake is no longer wanted.
…
I refreshed my social media feed, and a new post popped up.
“La la la! My very first home, and it’s all mine!”
The picture was of Anna, a smug grin on her face, holding up the signed deed to her new property.
The comments were a flood of congratulations, but Todd’s was the most prominent.
“Congrats, Machine!”
A bitter smile twisted my lips. That was the nickname my colleagues had given me.
In five years, I hadn’t taken a single day off. I was working on my laptop right up until the moment I was wheeled into surgery once. At my most exhausted, I had to take a video conference while hooked up to an oxygen tank.
They all saw the woman who worked herself to the bone.
They didn’t see the girl holding a family together on her own.
After my father got sick, the responsibility of raising my younger siblings fell squarely on my shoulders. The six-figure medical bills were a weight that threatened to crush me.
To raise the money, I worked day and night, blurring into one long, exhausting shift. I’d drunk so much with clients I’d thrown up blood, and I’d collapsed from exhaustion more times than I could count.
Todd saw it all.
When I couldn’t get a cab, he would be there in minutes to pick me up. When I came home late from a networking dinner, he’d have a bowl of soothing soup waiting for me. When a client gave me a hard time, he would find a way to step in and smooth things over.
But it was this same man who stabbed me in the back when it mattered most.
He knew how terrified I was of losing my father, yet he handed the fruits of my labor to Anna without a second thought.
In his mind, Anna had nothing, and this condo was everything to her.
But did he ever stop to think that not only did I not have a home, but I was about to lose the only father I had?
Tears streamed down my face, hot and unstoppable.
A moment later, my phone rang. It was my father’s doctor.
“Your father just passed away.” His voice was heavy with regret. “I’m so sorry. If we had been able to operate sooner, there was still a chance he could have been cured.”
I don’t know how I got through the funeral arrangements.
Todd called several times during those days. I would just stare at his name on the screen, my heart numb, and let it ring.
It was the first time I’d ever heard real panic in his voice. He cornered me the moment I stepped into the office.
“Where have you been?” he demanded. “You never take time off.”
He didn’t sound concerned. He sounded angry. Afraid, even. As if I’d slipped from his control.
I opened my mouth, but no words came out. The old me would have poured my heart out to him.
Not anymore.
As I tried to walk past him, he grabbed my arm, his hot breath on my neck. “What’s wrong with you? It’s only been a few days, but you’re like a different person!”
Before I could answer, Anna appeared, sidling up to him with a practiced pout.
“Todd, sweetie, could you do me a huge favor?”
His attention shifted to her instantly. “What is it? Take your time.”
Anna bit her lip, her voice a mix of guilt and distress. “You know I just made the down payment on my new place last week? I thought I had enough for renovations, but I went way over budget. Now the contractor is demanding payment before they’ll start, and I don’t have a cent to my name.”
She looked up at him, her eyes wide and pleading. “I’ve asked everyone I know, but nobody can help me. I had no one else to turn to. Could you possibly…”
“Yes.”
He cut her off, his answer firm and immediate. He pulled out his phone and dialed, his voice unwavering.
“I need you to list the house in Southwood. Right now. I don’t care about the price; I need it sold today.” He paused, listening. “That’s right. I don’t care how much of a loss we take. I need the cash. The faster, the better.”
Anna dabbed at her eyes with a theatrical flair, her voice choked with emotion. “Oh, Todd, you can’t! That house is in a great neighborhood, its value is only going to go up. It’s a terrible time to sell.”
She shot a timid glance in my direction. “Besides, that’s the house you bought to get married in! Sarah would never agree to this.”
Todd stepped in front of Anna, shielding her as if I were a threat. His dark eyes bore into me.
“What does it matter if she agrees? It’s not her house.”
He looked at me, his expression hard. “Sarah, be reasonable. Anna’s all alone in this city, trying to make it on her own. We should be supporting her.”
He let out an exasperated sigh. “Besides, it’s not like we can’t get married if we’re renting. I’m still willing to marry you. What more could you possibly want?”
I stood frozen, the blood turning to ice in my veins.
In his eyes, I was the one desperate to marry him. His willingness to go through with it was a gift he was bestowing upon me.
He seemed to have forgotten that he was the one who had begged me to be his girlfriend in the first place.
And now, he was selling the house he’d bought for us, for Anna. The irony was almost too much to bear.
I remembered my father lying in the ICU. The doctor had handed me a form, telling me to sign, that they’d have to stop treatment if I couldn’t pay. I had sobbed, begging Todd to lend me the money, offering to sign an IOU, to work for him for the rest of my life.
And what had he said then?
“The market is still rising, it would be a huge loss to sell now. And it’s our future home. It’s bad luck to sell it before we’re even married.”
But now, for Anna’s renovation costs, he was selling it without a second thought, casually saying he didn’t care about the loss.
Apparently, my father’s life was worth less than the cost of new cabinets for Anna’s condo.
I stared straight ahead, my face a blank mask.
“Sell it if you want. I don’t have an opinion.”
A flicker of panic crossed Todd’s face. He started to say something, then stopped.
I turned and walked away. I’d only taken a few steps when a warm hand closed around my wrist.
Todd’s Adam’s apple bobbed. “I’ll… I’ll clear my schedule this week,” he said, his voice strained. “I’ll make time to go see your dad. His biggest wish was to see us get married. We can talk about the wedding details then.”
I looked at his earnest face and thought about how, in all the time my father was in the hospital, he had never once visited.
Even when my dad had a moment of lucidity and asked to see him, Todd was always busy. Busy helping Anna move. Busy taking Anna’s dog to the vet.
My father died without ever seeing him again.
And now he was offering a visit like it was some grand gesture. The words felt like swallowing broken glass.
“Don’t bother.”
My voice was flat.
“There’s no need.”
I pulled my wrist free and walked away without looking back.
Back in my empty apartment, my aunt called. A company down south was interested in me. They were offering triple my current salary. She wanted to know if I was interested.
I accepted without a moment’s hesitation.
There was nothing left for me in this city.
The next day, I went to the office to hand in my resignation.
As it happened, the boss was treating everyone to a farewell dinner for me. During the meal, someone suggested a game of “Truth or Dare.”
Anna got dared to kiss someone in the room.
Her eyes flickered toward me before she raised a finger and pointed it directly at Todd.
“I choose Todd! It’s just a game, Sarah, hope you don’t mind!”
The room went silent.
Once, another girl had confessed her feelings to Todd right in front of me. Unwilling to be rude, he had awkwardly accepted the flowers she offered. The next second, I had snatched them from his hands and thrown them in the trash.
Anyone who knew me knew I had zero tolerance for that kind of thing. I didn’t share.
Now, all eyes were on me, waiting for the explosion.
But I just lifted my water glass, drained it in one gulp, and started clapping enthusiastically.
“Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!” I chanted with a wide smile. “It’s just a game, don’t be a buzzkill!”
My colleagues stared at me, dumbfounded, as if they were seeing me for the first time.
Todd’s expression shifted from guarded curiosity to outright disbelief. He opened his mouth to speak, but my applause drowned him out.
Anna, clearly not expecting this reaction, had a flicker of confusion cross her face before her coy smile returned.
She stood on her toes and pressed a long, deep kiss to Todd’s lips.
He froze, his eyes locked on me, a war of hesitation and guilt playing out on his face.
Then, after a few seconds, he wrapped his arm around Anna’s waist and deepened the kiss.
The two of them became more and more lost in the moment, their movements growing more passionate. Cheers erupted around them.
But all I could hear was a dull ringing in my ears.
I remembered a long time ago, a girl had snuck a kiss on Todd’s cheek when he was drunk. When I found out, I cried all night, my eyes swollen shut.
Todd had held me and comforted me for an entire day. He bought me my favorite strawberry cheesecake, knelt in front of me, and swore, “Baby, I know how much trust means to you. I promise, I will never so much as touch another woman’s finger.”
His eyes had been so sincere then, his voice so firm. He had made me feel so safe.
But now, he was kissing another woman in front of me, all his promises forgotten.
Even though I had already decided to let him go, the pain was still sharp enough to take my breath away.
After three minutes, they pulled apart, their faces flushed.
Anna wiped her lips. “Sorry about that, Sarah. Just a game, you know!” she said, her tone humble but her eyes glinting with triumph.
Todd’s knuckles were white as he clutched the fabric of his shirt, bracing himself for the fight he was sure was coming.
I calmly put down my chopsticks, picked up a napkin, and dabbed my lips. My voice was perfectly steady. “No problem at all. It’s just a game. The important thing is that everyone has fun.”
I offered a gentle smile.
The light in Todd’s eyes died. The tension drained from his body, replaced by an unmistakable wave of disappointment.
He looked at me like I was a stranger.
After my resignation was finalized, I packed my bags for the move south.
I remembered there was one thing left behind: a wooden rocking chair, still at Todd’s house.
It was the wedding gift my father had spent three months building for me.
Now, it was the only thing I had left of him.
I had to get it back.
I went to the house and entered my birthday, our usual passcode.
Error.
I tried again, thinking I’d made a mistake. Still error.
I didn’t try a third time. I switched to the fingerprint scanner.
My print had been deleted.
I was about to call Todd when I remembered Anna’s date of birth from her resume.
On a whim, I punched it in.
The door clicked open.
I stepped into the living room and froze. Todd and Anna were both there.
A romantic candlelit dinner for two. Champagne, cake, steak, and a trail of rose petals leading to the bedroom.
They stared at me, stunned.
Then, a slow, triumphant smirk spread across Anna’s face. She looked at me with such open provocation that for a second, I felt like I was the one who had been caught doing something wrong.
Todd composed himself, but he couldn’t hide the panic in his eyes.
“How… how did you get in?”
The question was laughable. Deleting my fingerprint, changing the code—wasn’t it all to prevent this exact scenario?
He didn’t need to go to such trouble. All he had to do was say the word “breakup.” It’s not like I would have clung to him.
“I typed in a certain someone’s birthday, and the door just opened.” I let my gaze drift pointedly to Anna.
She immediately shifted in her seat, forcing a smile. “Oh, that! I was just messing around with the code for fun, Sarah. Don’t mind me.” She glanced nervously at Todd.
I ignored her.
“And I suppose you deleted my fingerprint for fun, too?”
“Sarah!” Todd’s roar was like a clap of thunder. I couldn’t tell if he was defending his new love or just lashing out in shame. “Is that enough? Do you always have to be so aggressive?”
I looked at his face, twisted with a rage I had never seen before, and suddenly felt very, very tired.
I turned to Anna. “Get up.”
She looked at me, confused.
I repeated myself.
