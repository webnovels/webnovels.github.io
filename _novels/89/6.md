Ever since I met Jack,

I suspected that he might be the one sent by Zack to protect me.

After all, even their names were so similar.

I loved making pork rib soup for him.

Especially on early summer evenings when the sunset dyed everything red, I would serve him a bowl of rib soup and listen to him say over and over:

"Alice, I love you so much.

"I will love you forever."

Then I would walk over, completely satisfied, hug him, and kiss his eyes, jaw, and the corners of his mouth.

I almost believed that he wasn't sent by Zack.

He might actually be Zack.

Later, we had a child.

I cherished him immensely.

I believed this child

Would be my only hope for the rest of my life.
