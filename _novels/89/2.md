Seeing that I had no intention of speaking,

His colleagues turned to Jack for help:

"Boss! You can't cover for her this time! You have to take a drink as punishment for your wife!"

I glanced at Jack.

His usually calm eyes involuntarily drifted towards the corner where the little crybaby sat with rabbit-like eyes.

When he looked back at me, his expression returned to its usual rational and indifferent state:

"Tarot cards are just a Western method of predicting weather using astrology. It's not as accurate as our Chinese zodiac predictions. Besides, talking about fate like this breaks the spell and makes it invalid.

"Although Alice is my wife, I've always been objective and fair. In this case, Alice was indeed wrong, so I'll take a drink as punishment for her."

Jack, who had gastritis, had been abstaining from alcohol for half a year at my request.

But seeing Fiona with her red eyes, he gripped the glass tightly and downed it without hesitation.

As he drank, the chill in my heart grew deeper.

There was clearly no point in continuing this meal.

But Fiona's tears kept flowing:

"I have no right to blame you, sis. I heard you used to be a tarot streamer, so you must be accurate."

She sobbed.

Raising her wet eyes to look at Jack,

She seemed to make a painful decision:

"I'll definitely listen to you, sis. I'll cut ties with this man completely."
