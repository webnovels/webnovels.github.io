After the gathering,

The table of leftovers looked just like the anniversary that someone had forgotten today.

Jack, who usually helped clean up the table, suddenly changed his habit.

He walked over to me.

Still with an overly rational tone:

"I know today is our anniversary.

"If you're just upset because I broke our promise and decided to pick on the softest target among my colleagues, then any guilt or regret I had is now completely gone."

After saying this,

He lit a cigarette and went to the balcony, smoking one after another.

Through the glass door,

I saw the chat message he sent: "She's not accurate, you don't need to listen to her."

I watched him for a long time, until I lost myself in thought.

That face of his.

I had originally planned to love it for a lifetime.
