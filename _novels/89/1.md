The once pleasant weekend gathering suddenly became tense.

The men tried to use me as a fire extinguisher, desperate for me to say something comforting:

"What's all this talk about terrible situations? How could you scare our team's lucky charm like that!"

"Sis, you're in the wrong here! Tarot cards aren't supposed to predict life and death! Quick, say something nice!"

I ignored them.

Today was my third wedding anniversary with Jack.

I had been preparing this meal, including these ribs, since 1 PM. I even started the soup three hours in advance.

He brought his noisy project team members home with him.

Our promised anniversary celebration turned into his team's success party.
