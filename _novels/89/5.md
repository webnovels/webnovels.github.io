I frantically searched for him for two years.

The tarot cards told me he was gone, and I even found out the location of his grave.

But I didn't believe he was dead.

I kept looking for him while living a free and easy life in Dali, until one day, while setting up a tarot stall on the old street, I saw a man whose features were 99% similar to Zack's.

My heart was instantly gripped.

I stared at him intently, as if traveling through time and space, seeing Zack.

"Hello, are you a tarot reader? Can you do a reading for me?"

He crouched down, his eyes sincere, as if it was the past me asking Zack: "Hey tarot reader, can you do a reading for me?"

Time seemed to intersect at that moment.

I couldn't tell for a moment if the man in front of me was Zack I had imagined, or if my memory was playing tricks on me.

How could there be two people in this world who looked exactly the same?

I chatted with him for a bit, and he said his name was Jack and wanted me to predict when his lucky person would appear.

So I let him draw a few tarot cards.

He drew several cards in succession: The Magician, Six of Cups, The Sun, and The Tower.

Looking at the cards, I immediately understood.

I said honestly:

"You will have a female benefactor who will help you. As long as you're with her, your career and relationships will be full of opportunities.

"But with The Tower present, it means you won't have any ability to protect yourself in front of her."

I always have an instant feeling about tarot cards.

I even had a rough impression of this female benefactor: "This woman is very mysterious, her work is related to Western mysticism, but I can't see what her feelings for you are, the tarot cards didn't say anything about that."

Jack crouched in front of my stall, a flash of shock crossing his eyes:

"The only girl I know who's into Western mysticism is you, isn't it?"
