I was injured in an explosion while on a mission abroad, protecting my younger brother. The blast left me in a coma.

My brother, grateful for my life-saving act, returned home and married my wife.

When I finally regained consciousness and hurried back home, I witnessed a heartbreaking scene.

My son was on his knees, sobbing, his college acceptance letter torn to shreds.

My nephew was viciously beating my son's back with a metal pipe, shouting, "Your mom's gonna lick my boots. Who do you think you are to go to college?"

Meanwhile, my wife stood by, applauding and occasionally wiping the sweat from my nephew's brow.

"You're just like your dead father, only fit to be my stepping stone!"

My eyes blazed with fury as I clenched my fists. Anyone who dared harm my son would face hell!
