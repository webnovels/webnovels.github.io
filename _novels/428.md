Two months after a car accident left my face disfigured, my husband Jack and his sophisticated sister Olivia got together.

When my parents found out, not only did they not blame Jack, they actually urged me to step aside.

Even my own daughter looked at me with disgust.

"I don't want this ugly freak as my mom. I want Aunt Olivia to be my mom," she said.

I calmly agreed and chose to leave the Jiang family, cutting ties with them completely.

After years of hard work and struggle, I finally achieved financial freedom.

Later, I adopted two children from an orphanage.

Under my careful nurturing, they became a rising tech star and a business tycoon worth billions.

Watching them succeed, I decided to indulge myself for once and go on an aimless backpacking trip.

Halfway through my journey, Jack showed up with our daughter.

Seeing my disheveled appearance from roughing it, their faces were full of mockery.

"Looks like we were right. After leaving the Jiang family, you're just barely scraping by like a beggar."

"My parents want to see you now. We'll give you one more chance to come back with us."

"It'll also let you experience the wealthy lifestyle we Jiangs enjoy now, you beggar."
