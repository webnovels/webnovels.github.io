I deliberately smashed the glass doors of a shopping mall and turned myself in to the police.

My wife, furious, stormed in after me, yelling, “Why would you turn yourself in? This is something we could’ve fixed with money!”

I shrugged, raising my hands as the officers cuffed me and led me into custody.

Why? Because in my last life, her so-called soulmate—her childhood friend—came crawling back to her after his business failed.

He staged a car accident, killed someone, and pinned the blame on me. All for the sake of stealing my multi-million-dollar fortune.

What followed was a nightmare. The victim's family and the media hounded me relentlessly, convinced I was the one behind the crime.

Every piece of evidence—every surveillance video—showed my face.

Even my wife insisted I’d done it, claiming I acted out of revenge and an unhinged desire to lash out at the world.

In the end, I was stabbed to death by the victim’s family in front of a crowd.

And then, I woke up.

I was back on the day her soulmate staged the accident.
