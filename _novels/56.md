I was a rehabilitation therapist hired by a wealthy family, but I ended up posing as the groom to marry into the Mason Family.

The CEO's wife despised me for wrecking the grand wedding she had meticulously planned for her childhood friend. Disregarding the heavy snowfall outside, she dumped cold water over me and punished me by making me kneel outside the front gate for three days and nights.

While I was freezing and bruised, she spent her days drinking and partying with her male companion inside. To entertain him, she even ordered the removal of my sister's oxygen tube, resulting in her suffocation and death.

Afterward, she casually tossed me a check:

"Didn't you claim to love your sister the most? Now that she's gone, I don't see you shedding a single tear."

"Fill in the amount yourself, and don't go around saying the Mason Family is stingy with their sister-in-law."

I turned away, tore up the check, and began arranging my sister's funeral.

What she didn’t know was that before the wedding, her childhood friend had taken the money and fled the country. I was merely a tool her family used to save her reputation.

Now, my sister is gone, and the debt to the Mason Family is repaid. It's time for me to leave.
