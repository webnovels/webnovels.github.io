Emily never imagined that she would overhear certain sounds coming from her mother-in-law's room. She initially thought her father-in-law had returned home.

To her shock, it turned out her mother-in-law was having an affair!

Margaret seemed confident that Emily wouldn't dare reveal this secret and continued to act shamelessly towards her!

However, a few days later, Margaret was suddenly diagnosed with HIV!

And Margaret's affair partner had also died...
