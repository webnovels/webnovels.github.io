At the gathering, I unexpectedly encountered Rowan, the boyfriend who had disappeared eight years ago. He seized my chin:

"Ms. Sage, weren't you the one who despised young love the most? Have you now realized that your daughter has fallen into disrepute?"

I tilted my head and replied, "You're right. I should go back and placate my benefactor to earn my mom's medical expenses."

He smirked:

"When you forced Iris to jump off a building, did you and your mother ever imagine ending up like this?"

"Sage, why aren't you dead yet?"

His question brought back memories of my past suicide attempts. But for the sake of my daughter, I chose to embrace life.

To cover the medical expenses, I asked my benefactor for money, but he wanted me to appease Rowan instead. I faced his mockery and cruelty once more.

In my despair, I declared:

"Even if I'm at the mercy of countless others, I will never let you touch me!"

Eventually, when he learned the whole truth, he broke down.

"Sage, give me another chance. I'll take care of you and your mother."
