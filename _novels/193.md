At the dining table, I dropped my chopsticks. When I bent down to pick them up, I saw my sister's foot stretched between my boyfriend's legs.

She remarked, "Your current boyfriend is quite impressive. I'm satisfied."

Later, she got involved with my boyfriend and said to me, "What can I do, Celeste Parker? It seems no man around you can resist me."

I laughed and turned to embrace the man she had loved for five years.
