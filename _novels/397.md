I was the perfect corporate wife in our elite circles.
When Blake Sterling got a model pregnant, I stepped in to make it all disappear.
When Blake was caught sneaking into hotels with an A-list actress, I greased palms and made scandalous photos and videos vanish.
Everyone in our elite circles said Blake Sterling had the perfect wife.
Their knowing smiles were laced with ridicule, but I didn't give a damn.
After cleaning up his final mess, I simply vanished.
Since then, Blake Sterling has been trying to find me, even across the ocean.
