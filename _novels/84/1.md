After my collision with my boss, Liam Beckett, landed me in the hospital, something felt very wrong.

Wait, are these my veiny hands?

And this perfectly tailored suit and tie?

And, oh, this... noticeable bulge?

I think I've somehow ended up in the body of a CEO.

Not completely sure, better check.

Seeing no one around, I discreetly reached for my waistband to confirm my suspicions—only to be interrupted by a shout.

"Ava Adeline, stop right there!"

I turned to see the person in the next bed pulling back the curtain, glaring at me, and flicking my forehead.

That was my body!

Oh no, I've really switched bodies with the CEO!

My name is Ava Adeline, but now I'm in the body of my boss, Liam Beckett.

And the person in front of me is Liam Beckett, now in the body of Ava Adeline.

The situation is awkward, with my hand hovering in that questionable area of the CEO's body.

Liam, trying to keep me in check, placed his hand on his chest.

"Go ahead, feel it, there's nothing much there," I said, breaking the tension.

Liam lowered his hand, "Looks like you're quite self-aware."

"Thank you, Mr. Beckett," I replied with a smile, "Although I'm curious if Mr. Beckett has anything noteworthy."

"Ava Adeline!"

Liam glared at me.

Honestly, seeing my face from this angle, I never realized how attractive I look!

"Glaring won't help, Mr. Beckett," I chuckled, "We should focus on how to switch back."

Liam sat on the bed's edge, "We swapped because we bumped our heads and passed out, right?"

"Yeah, that's right."

"Then theoretically, if we bump our heads again, we should switch back."

Liam leaned forward, tapping his head, "Go on, bump it."

I was incredulous, "You want me to hit myself?!"

Liam was puzzled, "What else? You want me to hit myself?"

"I'm a girl, what if I damage my face?"

At that moment, I used Liam's commanding voice to express the most delicate thoughts.

Liam glared, covering my mouth, "Don't say things like that using my face! We swapped bodies, and your forehead's fine, which means you're tough enough, go ahead and bump it!"

"You're the tough one!"

"What's wrong with being tough?"

Our argument was endless, so I rubbed my forehead, "Mr. Beckett, how about this, let's meet halfway, we'll bump our heads together on the count of three."

"Alright."

Liam slightly bowed his head, and I leaned in, our foreheads touching in what seemed like an intimate gesture, but we were both filled with animosity.

"Three, two, one..."

Suddenly, there was a commotion outside the hospital room, and the door swung open.

"Mr. Beckett, we're here to see you..."

Company colleagues barged in, and we couldn't stop the momentum we'd built up.

Our foreheads collided sharply, and stars danced before my eyes from the pain.

I clutched my forehead and fell back, "That hurt!"

The stunned colleagues quickly gathered around my bed.

"Mr. Beckett, are you alright?"

"Mr. Beckett!"

"Mr. Beckett!"

...

Honestly, I lost myself in the chorus of "Mr. Beckett."

Suddenly, it didn't seem so bad.

So, I looked with interest at the real "Mr. Beckett," who was pushed aside.

He looked aggrieved, receiving a heartfelt lecture from the Sales Director.

"Ava, I know you often complain about Mr. Beckett, but he's already in the hospital bed, and you're still tormenting him, that's not fair."

"Liam" frowned, "Ava... I complain a lot?"

The Director lowered his voice, "Yes, you complain about Mr. Beckett every day in the office, did you bump your head silly?"

Why does this Director talk so much!

I cleared my throat and assumed Mr. Beckett's demeanor, "Thank you, everyone."

"No need to thank us, Mr. Beckett!"

I deliberately looked in Liam's direction, trying to stay calm, "Ava, I know I've been a bit hard on you, like only wanting five ice cubes in my iced Americano, using single-sided print paper, entering with the right foot in the morning..."

Liam raised an eyebrow.

"Here, I promise, and ask everyone to witness, I won't treat Ava like that anymore!"

"Great! Mr. Beckett is so considerate!"

"Mr. Beckett is awesome!"

Company colleagues applauded, while "Liam" glared at me with a dark expression.

"Ava, keep up the good work!" I said cheerfully, going in for a high-five with "Liam."

Liam was furious but couldn't say anything at that moment, so he forced a smile and high-fived me.

It was less a high-five and more like a slap on my hand.

I gritted my teeth against the pain and cheerfully dismissed the colleagues.

As they left, they murmured that Mr. Beckett seemed more approachable.

Once it was just Liam and me in the hospital room, Liam finally exploded, "Ava Adeline! Are you tired of living?!"

Looking at my face saying such words, I suddenly felt a sense of nostalgia, "Mr. Beckett, honestly, every day working under you, I felt like I didn't want to live."

Liam paused.

"But now that I'm Mr. Beckett, suddenly life seems a bit interesting."

Liam was at a loss for words.

"Mr. Beckett, as a temporary measure, let's keep it this way, is that alright?"

Using Liam's voice and body, I said the most ordinary, humble words of Ava Adeline.

Liam suddenly fell silent.

After a while, he spoke, "I guess bumping our heads isn't a solution right now, so let's stay this way for a while."

Still the ever-proud Liam finding an escape route for himself.

"Okay, Mr. Beckett."

"When we leave the hospital, you'll move to my place, it'll be more convenient, and we won't get caught."

"Alright, Mr. Beckett."

"I have no interest in you," Liam added.

"I know that, of course."

"Since you know, then handle the discharge."

Always so proud, always that high-and-mighty attitude.

I silently complained, just about to get up when I suddenly felt the urge to go, "Mr. Beckett, I think I need to use the restroom."

Liam's face turned red with embarrassment, "Go!"

Just around the corner from the hospital room was the men's restroom, I hesitantly went in and came out with confidence.

Back in the room, I threw a suggestive look at Liam.

Liam's twisted expression seemed to tell me to shut up.

But I wouldn't.

"Mr. Beckett, quite impressive," I gave a thumbs up.

"Get out!"
