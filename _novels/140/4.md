After that day, Nora didn't come to see me again, claiming she felt guilty.

The next time I saw them was at my engagement party.

The three men looked exhausted, as if they had been dragged there against their will.

Nora couldn't hide the envy and hatred in her eyes when she looked at me.

Confused, I asked Uncle. I had told him that after the arranged marriage with Wesley, there was no need to invite them to the engagement party.

Uncle shook his head, not knowing why they came.

I steadied myself and pretended not to see them.

But the way the three appeared at the party made it impossible to ignore them.

Because they looked as if they were about to become the leaders of the Quinn Family at any moment.

Guests warmly greeted the three:

"Mr. Cheng, after today, your position in the Quinn Family will be extraordinary."

"Yes, I heard that Miss Quinn's favorite is still you!"

"Mr. Cheng, Mr. Pei, Mr. Lu, you're all so handsome. Miss Quinn will be very lucky indeed."

I laughed coldly inside. The truth was just the opposite; they all despised me.

I tapped the microphone to draw everyone's attention to me.

"Everyone, today I'm announcing who I'm marrying. Thank you for coming to my engagement party."

Suddenly, a figure stepped onto the stage, crying. It was none other than Nora, looking to cause trouble:

She hesitated, biting her lip:

"Sister, I've already bought an identical vase for you. Don't let my mom go."

Before I could push her away, Asher and the others were in front of me.

"Miss Quinn, didn't I say I would marry you, as long as you don't make things hard for Nora?"

Nora kneeled, grabbing my dress:

"Sister Quinn, my father relies on medicine to survive, and without this job, my family can't live."

For a moment, we stood in the middle of the stage.

Before I could respond, Asher slapped me in anger.

"Apologize to Nora!"

Beckett helped Nora up from the ground: "Nora, there's no need to kneel to this vile woman!"

Caspian protectively stood in front of Nora:

"We've come as you wished for you to pick from us. What more do you want?"

With those words, everyone noticed the redness at the corners of my eyes.

I stepped forward amidst them.

They instinctively shielded Nora, and the audience fell silent.

No one stood up for me against their actions. The guests knew that one of the three would eventually control the Quinn Family, so no one dared to speak up for me.

I stubbornly raised my head, wiping away the tears at the corner of my eyes, revealing my reddened cheek.

"Wronged?"

At that moment, I looked deeply at them.

"No, I have nothing to be wronged about, and nothing to apologize for."

Coldly, I ordered my people: "Throw them out!"

Instantly, chaos broke out below the stage, and the three stared at me in disbelief.

Asher's eyes darkened: "Throw us out? Quinn, without us, who will you marry? Don't forget, this is our engagement party!"

Not just Asher, even the usually gentle Beckett threatened me: "Miss Quinn, I advise you to kneel and apologize to Nora, or without us, you can't take over the Quinn Family."

Caspian echoed: "Yes! Even if you apologize now, after marriage, you must promise not to bully Nora!"

Asher looked at the pitiful Nora in his arms, reminding me:

"Quinn, if you want to tear this apart, after marriage, you'll just be a decoration in the Quinn Family."

"Yeah, if you're sensible now, maybe Asher will treat you and Mr. Quinn better after marriage."

The audience urged me too.

"Yes, Miss Quinn, endure a little grievance."

"Otherwise, your life after marriage won't be good. Apologize quickly."

I calmly watched everything unfold and had the unveiling board for the engagement party brought up behind me.

I glanced coldly at the three of them: "I'm not marrying any of you."

The sneer on my lips piqued the curiosity of the audience:

"Miss Quinn, don't joke. If you don't marry any of them, who will you marry?"

The three waited confidently for me to bow my head and admit my mistake.

At this moment, I felt unprecedented calmness, raising my glass with a smile:

"Thank you all for your kindness, but I, Quinn, am the rightful and only heir to the Quinn Family."

"My husband will only be someone who matches the Quinn Family!"

The next second, a red curtain dropped, and on the screen appeared a strikingly handsome face.

The audience gasped collectively.

"Wesley?!"

"Isn't that Wesley, the eldest son of the prestigious Wesley Family in North City?!"

Suddenly, the three fiancés looked up at the screen...

Their eyes filled with shock and awe.
