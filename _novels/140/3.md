The carved vase was worth billions, a token of love from my father to my mother when I was born. My mother cherished it until she passed.

I later studied ceramics and fixed its flaws. I kept it in my collection room, the key only Asher had.

Now, because of a careless act, my mother's last memory for me was gone.

Asher avoided my gaze, turning awkwardly: "Nora never experienced a rich life, so I let her see it."

"You have so many collectibles, you wouldn't be so petty about this, would you?"

I continued to look at him coldly.

He coughed, continuing: "Don't act like we wronged you. I'll announce our marriage at the retirement ceremony. Will that satisfy you?"

Seeing Asher hesitate before deciding, I almost felt like unwanted trash.

But I'm the Quinn's treasured daughter, yet they pitied Asher for marrying me: "Brother Asher, don't force yourself. Quinn is hard to deal with. Marrying her is worse than dying."

Caspian seemed ready to tear me apart: "Satisfied now? Your wishful thinking finally paid off!"

Nora hugged Asher, upset: "Brother Asher, don't do this. I'm not worth it. I'll pay for the vase even if it takes a lifetime."

An unprecedented exhaustion washed over me. I forced a smile: "Asher, I won't marry you."

Asher was stunned, frowning, sensing something amiss. Beckett and Caspian were also taken aback, stepping back. Maybe it was my imagination, but there seemed to be hope in their eyes.

But then Beckett harshly slapped reality: "Don't come after us then."

Nora felt deeply wronged and clung to Asher:

"Asher, please don't do this for my sake. It's not worth it. I'll handle the cost myself, even if it takes me my entire life to repay Miss Quinn."

I felt an overwhelming wave of exhaustion and managed a faint smile:

"Asher, I'm not going to marry you."

Asher froze, surprise creasing his brow as if sensing something was off.

Beckett and Caspian also seemed taken aback, stepping back in shock. I might have imagined it, but there seemed to be a flicker of hope in their eyes.

However, the next moment, Beckett slapped me hard:

"Then keep your eyes off the two of us."

Seeing Beckett clinging to Caspian for comfort, I clenched my fists. It hurt to be rejected by friends I'd grown up with. I held back my tears.

I turned to close the door.

Nora suddenly dropped to her knees, pleading with me, putting on a pitiful act:

"Please, Miss Quinn, if you need to blame someone, blame me. They were forced to be your fiancés. I've seen how hard it has been for the three brothers living with the Quinn Family all these years."

"As long as you leave them alone, I'm willing to serve you for the rest of my life."

As she spoke, her knees hit the marble floor heavily, instantly turning red.

Asher quickly helped Nora up, glaring at me:

"Quinn! What game are you playing now? Are you trying to play hard to get?"

"Let me tell you, are you just trying to use this as an excuse to drive Nora away?"

"If you have the guts, don't marry me!"

I chuckled and replied calmly, "Of course, I won't marry you."

The three exchanged glances, but instead of feeling relieved, Asher grabbed me:

"Ha, who else can you marry besides us?"

"If you don't marry me, are you planning to ruin Beckett and Caspian too? Haven't they suffered enough with the Quinn Family? Isn't that enough for you?"

Asher took a deep breath in anger: "If you stop bullying Nora in the Quinn Family, I can sacrifice myself to marry you. You don't have to create drama by backing down!"

I met his eyes, filled with silent despair, as if he was being forced and protesting without words.

I spoke each word to Asher with deep conviction:

"I'm serious. In the end, you won't have to worry about anything."

Asher, you don't need to worry about me bullying Nora, nor do you need to feel humiliated by marrying me.

As long as I marry Wesley, everything will go as you wish.
