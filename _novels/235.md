"We crashed on the way home for Christmas, me and my husband, Fred.
I woke up, and bam, we were back before we even started dating.
Last time around, we were married for seven years, all polite smiles, but he wouldn't even think about having kids with me.
Turns out, Fred was still hung up on his high school sweetheart.
So, this time, I decided to let him go.
We ghosted each other on social media, kept our distance, and went our separate ways.
Fast forward seven years, and he's this hotshot stock trader, partying at our high school reunion with his darling, Ashley.
Seeing me still single, he just had to get in a dig.
""You know, Sarah, I get it. I'm like, the best guy you ever had, twice over. But you don't have to mope around forever!""
I just ignored him and took my son's hand.
Fred's face went white. His eyes were bloodshot as he demanded, ""Didn't you say you'd love me forever? That you only wanted to have my babies?"""
