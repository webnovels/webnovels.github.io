I sat in the car, raindrops blurring the windows.

Ethan's figure grew smaller in the rain, eventually disappearing from view.

The driver glanced at me cautiously in the rearview mirror. "Where to now, Ms. Carter?"

"The office," I said, scrolling through the files my assistant had sent. A cold smile played on my lips.

"And set up a meeting with Sophia for me."

At 2 AM, the lights in my office were still on.

On the computer screen:

Sophia's bank statements for the past three months, photos of her secret meetings, even email exchanges with Greene Corp's competitors - everything was laid out clearly before me.

This woman who had caused my miserable death in my past life was now walking step by step into the trap I had set.

"Ms. Carter, Miss Evans has arrived," my assistant knocked and announced.

I closed my laptop and looked up towards the door.

Sophia wore a white sundress, her makeup impeccable, her eyes carrying that same air of innocence and vulnerability as always.

She bit her lower lip, timidly speaking up: "Olivia, you wanted to see me?"

In my past life, it was this exact damsel-in-distress act that had Ethan wrapped around her finger.

I smiled faintly, gesturing for her to sit. "I hear you and Ethan have been getting quite close lately?"

A flash of pride crossed her eyes before she quickly concealed it. "Ethan just... looks out for me, that's all."

"Is that so?" I slid a folder across the desk to her. "Then do you know he's been investigating your transfer of company funds?"

The color drained from Sophia's face in an instant.

She abruptly stood up, her chair scraping harshly against the floor. "What are you talking about?!"

I calmly flipped open the folder, my finger tapping on the numbers:

"Thirty million, transferred to offshore accounts. What do you think Ethan's reaction would be if he found out?"

Her fingers clutched her skirt tightly, knuckles turning white. "What... what do you want?"

I stood up, looking down at her:

"It's simple," I said softly. "I want you to continue."

Three days later, Greene Enterprises' stock price plummeted.

Following my plan, Sophia frantically cashed out Greene Corp assets, even going so far as to forge Ethan's signature.

Meanwhile, Ethan, the man who had been so cold and heartless in my past life, was now frantically searching for me like a madman.

My phone was flooded with his calls, his car perpetually parked outside my office building.

He even started sending flowers to my office every day, with cards that simply read "I'm sorry."

Too little, too late.

"Ms. Carter, Greene Corp has applied for emergency loans from the banks," my assistant reported. "But regarding Sophia..."

"Keep going," I said, not looking up as I signed documents. "Have her transfer that final sum as well."

My assistant hesitated for a moment:

"But... if Greene Corp really goes bankrupt, the shares you still hold..."

I chuckled softly: "Who cares about that bit of money?"

What I wanted was for Ethan to lose everything.

Just like I had in my past life.

A month later, Greene Enterprises officially announced the breakdown of its capital chain.

I stood in a coffee shop across from Greene Tower, watching as Ethan was surrounded by reporters.

He had lost a lot of weight, his suit hanging loosely on his frame, dark circles prominent under his eyes.

A reporter asked sharply:

"Mr. Greene, we've heard this crisis is related to your fiancée, Sophia Evans?"

Ethan's head snapped up, his gaze fierce: "She is not my fiancée."

"Then was your divorce from Olivia Carter also for Miss Evans' sake?"

His expression crumbled instantly.

I set down my coffee cup and turned to leave.

Suddenly, a commotion broke out behind me, followed by Ethan's heart-wrenching cry: "Olivia!"

I didn't look back.

It started to rain. I opened my umbrella and walked into the crowd.

In this life, I had finally learned to leave without a backward glance.
