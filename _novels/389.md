I knew Rachel had also come back to the first day of senior year when she tore up our couple's notebook in front of the entire class and handed it back to me before sitting next to Tyler, the new transfer student everyone was crushing on.
I calmly picked up the torn notebook and gave my spot on the math competition team to Emily, the scholarship student from the class next door who I often ran into at the library.
In our previous life, Rachel and I had promised to attend the same college and spend our lives together. It wasn't until the night before her wedding, when she drunkenly pulled out the love letter she had given Tyler years ago and called me crying about how she couldn't marry the man she truly loved, that I realized she never really loved me.
Given a second chance at life, I chose to let us both go.

While Rachel was busy skipping class and having fun with Tyler, I was leading our competition team to dominate the national finals.
On the day the SAT scores were released, Rachel, who had gotten pregnant and dropped out, saw a video of me being interviewed as the state's top scorer. She completely lost it!
