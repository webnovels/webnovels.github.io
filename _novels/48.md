In the fifth year of my marriage to Daniel Thompson, he had an affair with his personal assistant because I couldn't get pregnant.

He brought her home, took over the master bedroom, usurped my position as the lady of the house, and occupied the place by his side.

I never made a fuss, just packed my bags and prepared to leave.

But he sneered and said, "Don't forget, your parents' lives are in my hands."

His friends bet in front of me, guessing when I would kneel and beg Daniel to take me back.

At the auction, he helped his little assistant humiliate me.

What he didn't know was that my parents were already dead, and he was the one incapable of having children.

As I watched my long-lost love return, I secretly vowed.

This time, I would not only leave, but also ruin his reputation completely.
