I coldly watched this heartless woman and couldn't help but scoff.

I wondered who chased after me, clinging to me, caring for me, even declaring publicly they'd marry no one but me.

If Grandpa hadn't seen her genuine affection, he wouldn't have chosen such a small-time fiancée for me.

Now she’s helping them frame me.

The way she looks at Jasper, so tenderly, it makes me nauseous.

"You can't even tell who your fiancée is. You're truly hopeless!"

Seeing my imposing manner and confident words, the crowd began to doubt.

"Looking at his appearance and demeanor, he doesn't seem like a beggar."

"And to cause such a scene at a birthday party, maybe he really has evidence, could he be the Mason Family's true Young Master?"

"He does look like the Young Master, whereas Jasper... it's hard to say."

Hearing the crowd's murmur, Jasper's face turned green.

Sister immediately took Jasper's hand and went on stage.

"The Mason Family has only this one Young Master, any others are imposters!"

"Today, not only are we handing the Mason Family to Jasper, but we’ll also arrange his marriage, to stop such nonsense from happening again!"

Grandma angrily hit my back with her Cane, "Such an ungrateful wretch! The Mason Family was blind to raise you!"

The crowd began to criticize me.

"Look how you’ve pushed them, they’re rushing into marriage, what a disgrace."

"The Mason Family at least fed you, didn’t let you pick trash, and you repay them like this, what a useless thing."

"Thick-skinned, heartless, eyeing someone else's inheritance."

Someone nearby spat at me.

Others followed suit, throwing whatever they had at me.

A glass hit my head, causing blood to flow.

Bodyguards pinned me down, forcing me to kneel.

Jasper, emboldened, stepped in front of me and whispered, "You still think you're the Mason Family's Young Master?"

"Now everyone stands by me, I'm the rightful heir. So what if Grandpa returns?"

I trembled with anger, wanting to tear him apart.

Jasper stepped back and said loudly, "The Mason Family won't tolerate such nonsense. Did you think I was easy to bully?"

A glass cup smashed on my head, and blood immediately started to flow.

The bodyguards pinned my shoulders down, forcing me to kneel and making it impossible to move.

Jasper approached me, whispering with a smirk, "You still think you're the Mason Family's heir, don't you?"

"Everyone's on my side now. I'm the rightful heir of the Mason Family. Even if Grandpa comes back, what can he do?"

I was trembling with anger, desperate to tear him apart right then and there.

Jasper stepped back and deliberately shouted, "The Mason Family won't tolerate troublemakers like you. You really think you can push me around?"

In the next moment, he triumphantly poured a bottle of red wine over my head.

The alcohol stung the wound on my forehead, causing excruciating pain.

I couldn't take it anymore. I broke free from the bodyguards' grip, grabbed the wine bottle, and smashed it on the ground, pointing the jagged end at Jasper. "You really think you can steal what's mine?"

A bodyguard tried to grab me, but I swung the bottle and cut his arm.

I had completely lost it.

I walked up to my Sister, who was shaking with fear.

"Tell me who I am! Who's your real brother?"

Then, I pointed the bottle at my Fiancée, who screamed continuously.

"Say it! Tell me who I am!"

The scene descended into chaos. Grandma glanced at the Cane in her hand, furious.

"Get on with it, are you all idiots?"

The bodyguards finally rushed at me, pinning me to the ground.

Sister stepped forward and slapped me hard, saying with disdain, "Break his arms and legs! Dump him at a trash site!"

Grandma declared loudly, "Our Mason Family has no room for a madman like him! From now on, he has nothing to do with the Mason Family!"

"Cut his ties with the Mason Family!"

The Lawyer approached with disownment papers for me to sign, but I struggled desperately.

Seeing this, Jasper stomped on my hand, grinding it viciously.

"If you won't sign, then leave your handprint!"

"Stop it, all of you!"

Suddenly, dozens of black-clad bodyguards burst through the door, followed by a furious old man with white hair.
