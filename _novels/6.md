My husband, Declan Mercer, and I had been married for three years.
Because his pregnant new lover, Tessa Ralston, wasn't satisfied with the pressure I used while massaging her feet, Declan crushed my wrist under his foot.
The fracture damaged my nerves. As a violinist, I could barely lift my phone anymore.
Declan, however, dismissed it nonchalantly.
"Stop acting spoiled. As the sister of a murderer, your only purpose is to serve us and atone."
Three years ago, Declan's sister, June Mercer, had no chance of survival after a car accident. My younger brother, Jasper Granger, had a congenital heart defect and needed a heart transplant.
To get the family's signature for the organ donation, I married Declan, bringing a wedding gift worth over a million dollars, and became completely obedient to him.
However, ignoring my injured hand, Declan still wanted me to make nourishing soup for his new lover.
Then I got a message from my mom.
[Jasper committed suicide. Come home quickly!]
Instantly, I could no longer hold my phone steady.
The debts had all been paid. It was time for me to leave.
