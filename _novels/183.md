When I received the medical report at the hospital, I was stunned, as if hit by a bolt from the blue. The report only mentioned a common cold, not the "kidney cancer" that nearly shattered me two weeks ago!

Realizing my cancer was just a misdiagnosis, I rushed home, eager to share the news with my boyfriend, Jasper. But as soon as I stepped out of the elevator and reached for my keys, I heard some muffled sounds from inside.
