The company chat group was buzzing with talk of Julian Davies's wedding, while I was busy picking out candy for the celebration.

It was supposed to be a task for him and the esteemed Seraphina Hayes, but with both of them so swamped, these trivial matters fell to me.

"Is CEO Davies really tying the knot with Ms. Hayes from the A Group? They’re a perfect power couple!"

"Congratulations! CEO Davies must be nearly thirty now, it's about time he settled down. I heard Seraphina was his first love."

"First love? She's the one that got away, his pure love. I heard they were childhood sweethearts."

I glanced at the bustling chat, said nothing, then opened my laptop and started printing my resignation letter.

Julian was half a perfectionist. Before his grand wedding with Seraphina, he’d clean up all the messy women around him. And I was the last loose end he needed to snip.

I'd been with Julian since I was 22, sticking around until 27.

Now, I was not only his personal indulgence but also his competent assistant.

A good assistant and compliant mistress knows how to anticipate her boss's needs. So, before Julian even had to ask, I had my resignation letter printed and placed it on his desk.

Right next to it was the list of recommended wedding candy brands.

Julian walked into his office precisely at 9:30 AM every day.

He saw me standing by the CEO's office door and called out, "Chloe, come in for a moment."

I nodded obediently, my face serene, and followed him inside.

"Mr. Davies, this is my resignation. And these are the wedding candies and recommended brands you asked me to select yesterday."

Julian's sharp eyes narrowed slightly as he scanned the resignation letter. Without a hint of hesitation, he pulled out a pen and swiftly signed his name.

"Chloe, these two apartments will be under your name. This card has five million. And the car I bought a while ago, that's yours too. Are these terms acceptable?"

I sat across from Julian, looking up at his serious, focused face. My eyes curved into a smile. "Perfectly acceptable, Mr. Davies."

A flicker of surprise crossed his face, but he quickly returned to normal. "Chloe, I hope you remember I don't like clingy women."

I reached out to take the card he offered, my smile still flawless. "I wouldn't dream of it, Mr. Davies. If there's nothing else, I'll be going now."

"Hm."

Julian said no more, immediately looking down at the documents in his hands.

I stood there quietly for a moment, wanting to use these last few seconds to etch his image into my mind.

Julian was a generous patron. His compensation packages when ending relationships were always lavish, and mine was the most substantial.

So, I had no reason to be dissatisfied with this ending.

Leaving the company and settling into a taxi heading back to my downtown apartment, I felt all the strength drain out of me. I leaned back against the seat, silently gazing out the window.

Julian had many mistresses, but I was the most obedient and sensible one, the one he trusted most.

Even his friends couldn’t help but marvel, asking where he’d found such a dutiful, considerate mistress who never took advantage of his affections.

Back then, Julian's eyes would always hold a hint of tenderness. When our fingers interlaced, he'd gently knead the soft flesh on the back of my hand. "Maybe it's fate."

But he probably never imagined that his most obedient mistress had already fallen for him, and that love had lasted five years.
