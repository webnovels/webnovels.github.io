Julian's eyes were filled with pity and sympathy, his words of affection like tiny needles, tugging at my heartstrings.

My heart stirred. The sting of the actress's slap was replaced by Julian's tenderness. I instinctively brushed my hand against his palm. "Because I trust you, Mr. Davies. I knew you wouldn't let me be wronged."

Julian raised an eyebrow, playfully squeezing my neck, then lowered his head to kiss me near my lips. "You trust your Mr. Davies that much?"

"Mm-hmm." I reached up and wrapped my arms around his neck, looking at him with devotion. "Mr. Davies is the only one who will protect me. I've always trusted you."

Julian was completely taken by my sincerity, by the way I trusted him implicitly.

That night, he was rough with me, a flurry of intense kisses raining down on my forehead, neck, and back. Finally, he paused over my heart.

I heard him murmur, "Chloe, you're a true gem. I really can't bear to let you go."

Unfortunately, the lighting was dim, and his captivating eyes were too distracting. I didn't pay much attention to that remark.

It was much later that I learned Julian had intended to hand me over to a business partner that day, but my trust in him had made him reluctant.

And he hadn't stood up for me because of *me* then; it was because the actress had used his girlfriend's identity to act arrogant toward Davies Corp. employees. Soon after, the actress was embroiled in a sex scandal that utterly destroyed her reputation.

"Chloe, I'm serious, you've got Julian Davies wrapped around your finger. Do you think there's a chance you'll become Mrs. Davies?"

When I heard Liam laughingly bringing up these old stories, I just smiled and raised my glass, playing along with his probing. "No chance, Mr. Liam. You're overthinking it."

Back at my downtown apartment, I walked barefoot on the cold floor, curled up on the sofa, watching the news channel extensively report on Julian Davies's wedding to Seraphina Hayes.

"Recently, Julian Davies, CEO of Davies Corp., announced his marriage to Seraphina Hayes, daughter of the Hayes Group. It's understood the two have been childhood sweethearts..."

I carefully watched every news segment about his impending marriage, seeing how perfectly matched he and Seraphina looked standing together.

Seraphina was beautiful, raised in a privileged home, carrying herself with grace, confidence, and undisguised pride.

I couldn't understand why anyone would think Julian sought mistresses as replacements for Seraphina.

Clearly... Seraphina was nothing like any of the women he had kept.

I first met Seraphina at a party.

That day, I didn't know who Julian was going to meet, but I could see the anticipation in his eyes.

He specifically hired a designer to pick out his outfit and even personally chose a gift, finally holding an amber-colored brooch and asking me to wrap it.

At the party, I finally understood Julian's unusual behavior was all for a young woman named Seraphina.

Seraphina sat in the center of the ballroom, her fingers dancing across black and white keys, producing one beautiful melody after another.

All the lights in the hall were focused on her; she was like a luminous fairy, captivating everyone's attention, including Julian's.

After finishing her piece, Seraphina stood up and walked toward us.

"Julian! I knew you'd come! Long time no see. And who is this?"

"My secretary." Julian gently took Seraphina's hand, deftly changing the subject. "Want to play a duet together?"

Seraphina smiled and nodded, her girlish shyness evident.

That day, Julian and Seraphina performed perfectly together, earning a standing ovation and countless compliments.

Amidst praises of "golden couple" and "perfect match," I learned the identity of that young lady.

Julian's childhood sweetheart, the one he held dearest, his future wife.
