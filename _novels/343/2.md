My story with Julian began with a setup.

After graduation, I worked diligently, hoping to make a living in the big city through my own efforts.

But life wasn't a fairy tale where dreams came true.

When I was 22, my boss, to shift blame onto me, accused me of leaking company secrets, causing significant losses, and facing ten years in prison plus a hefty fine.

I'd just been at Davies Corp. with my team leader, discussing a collaboration, when I heard the news. I don't know how I ended up stumbling into Julian's lounge, curled up in a corner, crying and begging any god to help me.

In the lounge, Julian's face clearly showed his annoyance at being woken. He stared at me blankly.

Perhaps seeing my ugly-crying, Julian tossed a pack of tissues my way. "Wipe your face. Stop begging gods, beg me. I'm far more useful than any deity."

Julian's face was fierce, a clearly menacing expression, yet I felt strangely at ease.

He was like a hero swooping in to save me.

I swallowed my tears and obediently walked over to him, pleading, "Sir, can you really help me? I was truly framed. I didn't leak any company secrets."

Julian stroked my head, his voice surprisingly soft. "This little thing? Of course, I can help you. But I'm a businessman, so what can you offer me?"

Thinking back to that day, I always felt Julian had peculiar tastes.

I was crying so ugly, and he still thought of making me his mistress. His taste must be truly extraordinary.

Later, I asked Julian why he wanted me to be his mistress. He said, "You were crying like a messy kettle, quite amusing. Besides, weren't you the one who asked for my help first?"

Once I realized it wasn't my face that had caught Julian's interest, I began to diligently learn how to be a good mistress.

I put away all my petty schemes, listened to my patron, avoided causing him trouble, never took advantage of his affections, and worked hard to improve myself so I could contribute to his success.

Countless times during boring flower arranging classes, I'd reflect on what good any of this was. Was I going to perform flower arranging while in bed with Julian?

In fact, my choices were correct. The more I learned, the more presentable I became.

I helped Julian close one tough contract after another and accompanied him to high-stakes meetings with powerful figures, never once embarrassing him.

Julian was very satisfied. He spent more and more time with me, showered me with more and more affection, even dragging me along to his gatherings with friends.

But I never played games. I just diligently did whatever Julian asked.

I witnessed Julian's cold indifference firsthand at an exclusive club.

A popular actress, soaked in liquor, lay sprawled on the carpet, frantically reaching for Julian's pant leg, only to be kicked away by a bodyguard.

Julian stood holding a glass of hard liquor, staring emotionlessly at the woman on the floor. "My girlfriend? Do you really think you're worthy?"

The actress, who had claimed to be Julian's girlfriend, frantically kowtowed, her body trembling. "Mr. Davies, I was wrong! Mr. Davies, it was a moment of madness, I spoke out of turn! I know I'm not worthy of being your girlfriend, I misspoke. Mr. Davies, please be magnanimous, don't hold it against me!"

Julian said nothing, letting his bodyguards hold the actress down and watch her struggle.

His peripheral vision caught me, and he waved me over.

He gently rubbed my face, which the actress had slapped, sighing softly. "Why are you so bad at protecting yourself? You let someone slap you? You're my competent assistant. How could you let someone bully you without saying a word?"
