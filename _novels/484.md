The day my mother took her own life, I finally decided to divorce my cancer-stricken wife, who’d stolen my mother’s life-saving money.

But just as I was about to speak, a row of bullet comments suddenly popped up before my eyes.

“OMG! Male lead, whatever you do, don't get a divorce! Just hold on a few more days, and you'll be the heir to a powerful empire!”

“Don’t let the female lead’s poverty and messy appearance fool you; she’s actually worth billions! She’s just pretending to be poor to test your sincerity. She’s completely obsessed with you!”

“Male lead, don't be stupid! What’s losing a mom compared to that? You'll have money and a beautiful wife soon enough. Marrying into that elite family is what truly matters!”

I stared at the constantly flashing comments. My eyes burned as I looked at my wife, who had just returned home after stealing my mom’s life savings and abandoning her to die a tragic death.
