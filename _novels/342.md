My cousin saw a marriage video online and wanted to marry an enclave leader, dreaming of living like royalty. The two handsome men in the video seemed so sincere.

[“We’re simply looking for a wife to spend our lives with. We promise to treat you well, cherish you, and grow old together.”]

Something felt off to me. I begged my cousin not to go.

Six months later, my cousin saw a viral live stream. There, in plain sight, were the same enclave leaders from the marriage video. 

A woman nestled happily in their arms, gushing about her blissful and incredibly wealthy life post-marriage. Turns out, the enclave leaders were worth hundreds of millions.

That very day, my cousin burst into my apartment and grabbed me, squeezing my neck tight. “You b*tch! Why did you stop me from marrying into a wealthy family?!”

When I opened my eyes again, I saw my cousin, Tiffany, blushing as she asked me, “Maya, should I go meet them?”
