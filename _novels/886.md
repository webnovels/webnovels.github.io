"Ms. Ingram, your application for the international student exchange program has been approved. Please reply to confirm."

Kayla Ingram stared at the message for a long time. Her slightly trembling finger hovered above the screen.

After a deep breath, she finally typed back. "Confirmed."

The moment she hit send, a low, clear voice sounded behind her. "Why are you out here alone? Aren't you going to watch the fireworks?"

Startled, she turned around. Darren Tate was standing just a few steps away.

Under the night sky, his figure was framed by the distant glow of the fairground lights. His features were striking, cast in sharp contrast by the shadows. He wore a simple white button-down, but on him, it looked effortlessly refined—tall, composed, and impossibly distant.

She hadn't answered yet when a loud boom exploded across the sky.

Fireworks bloomed against the night sky, loud and beautiful. People all around them gasped and looked up.

However, Kayla's gaze never left him. This was the 1001st time she had looked at him like this—silently, secretly.

And it would be the last.

Darren was the famously untouchable scion of the elite social circle in Cadville, and she… was just the housekeeper's daughter in the Tate residence.

They had grown up together, but he had never been like the rest of the spoiled, wealthy heirs around them. Darren was well-mannered and kind. He never acted superior and always treated her with quiet, genuine respect, even though she had no name or status.

He helped get her into one of the most exclusive private schools in Cadville. He walked with her to school every day and made sure she got home safely.

When classmates gave her a hard time, he was always the first to speak up for her.

When she got sick, he skipped his classes to take her to the hospital without a second thought. He never once forgot her birthday, and every year, there was always a gift picked out with care.
 
Falling for him had been far too easy.

Over the years, countless girls had confessed to Darren, but he never once said yes to any of them. Kayla thought he simply wasn't interested in love, so she kept her feelings hidden deep inside and never dared to hope.

Then in junior year, everything changed.

He had bumped into her roommate, Winona Wolfe, completely by accident.

That night, for the first time, he had come looking for Kayla. His eyes were lit with something she had never seen before. 

With a soft smile, he said, "Kayla, I think I like Winona. Would you help me win her over?"

In that moment, it felt like her heart had been carved out of her chest. It felt bloody, raw, and aching.

But Kayla still said yes.

Over the next few months, she watched him fall in love with someone else.

He drove across the entire city at 3:00 am just to buy a specific cake that Winona had once mentioned in passing. He rented out the entire hillside observatory because she said she wanted to see stars.

He even broke his rule of never posting on social media, turning his feed into a public love letter to Winona.

And today, he finally got her.

To celebrate, he spent ten million dollars setting off fireworks across the city for a full 24 hours.

That was when Kayla decided. She would leave this place, this city, and this version of herself behind. She was going to study abroad and never come back.

"You guys enjoy it. I'm a little tired. I think I'll head back to the dorm," she said softly, pulling her gaze away.

Darren frowned slightly. "The party hasn't even started yet. Why are you leaving so early? Kayla, I wouldn't be with Winona without your help. Stay and celebrate with us."

Wouldn't be with Winona without her help?

He wasn't wrong. Kayla was absolutely "indispensable".

It was Kayla who gave him Winona's number on WhatsApp. She who compiled all of Winona's favorite things into a neatly organized file. 

She picked the restaurant for their first date. Even this fireworks celebration—she had been the one playing piano in the distance while they toasted under the stars.

She had played the perfect matchmaker, nudging him step by step into someone else's arms.

But every time she helped him, it felt like tearing herself apart, piece by piece. The pain was sharp, raw, and relentless.

Still, she hid it well. He never noticed a thing.

Even now, she kept up the act.

She forced a smile. "You finally got the girl you love. Are you happy?"

Darren looked briefly stunned, as if her question had caught him off guard. But a moment later, his expression softened. He nodded with a quiet, easy smile. 

Kayla saw the happiness in his eyes. She smiled too. "Then I'm glad. That's all that matters."

That was enough. Now, she could finally let him go.

Darren didn't let her leave. In the end, he brought her back to the party with him.

Inside the grand hall, Winona was surrounded by a circle of girls, her face glowing with satisfaction.

"Darren is not just the heir to Tate Group, he's the campus heartthrob. Girls have been lining up for him since freshman year—some from halfway across the world. But he only has eyes for you, Winona. I'm so jealous."

Winona beamed under the praise. The moment she spotted Darren, she practically skipped toward him, her voice sweet and playful. "Darren! We haven't taken our fireworks kiss selfie yet!"

Darren chuckled and slipped an arm around her waist. Without a word, he leaned in and kissed her.

The crowd broke into cheers and whistles.

Winona blushed and gently pushed him away. Then she asked, as if just realizing, "Wait, where'd you go just now?"

"I went to find Kayla," he said casually.

Winona's smile faltered. Her gaze shifted, finally landing on Kayla. 

There was the faintest edge in her tone as she said, "I'm your girlfriend. Instead of staying with me, you were off checking on someone else? I heard you two grew up together. After all that time… don't tell me you never had feelings for her?"

Darren raised a brow, as if surprised by her jealousy. "Out of everyone I could fall for, it would never be Kayla."

The words hit Kayla like a blow. Her chest tightened, and color drained from her face.

On the other hand, Winona looked pleased. She glanced sideways at Kayla and asked, "Why not?"

"She's too familiar," he replied.

But Winona wasn't finished. She lifted a hand and pointed at the nearby table stacked with champagne flutes. "Then prove it. Have her drink all of that. If she does, I'll believe you."

Darren hadn't expected Winona to suddenly turn on Kayla, and a faint crease formed between his brows.

Upon sensing his hesitation, Winona's expression shifted, her voice turning soft and wounded. "You promised, didn't you? That if we got together, you'd do anything I asked. 

"You're gorgeous, rich, and way out of my league. It's only fair that I would feel a little insecure."

Darren finally turned to Kayla. "Kayla, you haven't had a drink tonight. Let's call this a toast—for me finally getting the girl I wanted. Go ahead. Have it all."

Each word landed like a blow to Kayla's chest, leaving her breathless.

Darren had to know she was allergic to alcohol. It wasn't some secret. 

He had seen it happen before. But to make Winona happy, he still asked her to drink.

A few soft chuckles echoed from nearby. A group of girls who had never liked her were whispering behind their glasses.

"Please. She's the housekeeper's daughter—did she really think she stood a chance with someone like Darren?"

"Exactly. She should've figured out her place by now."

Kayla bit down hard on her lip. Then, without a word, she reached for a glass.

She took one drink, then another, and then another. The burn spread through her throat, down her spine, then across her skin. Red blotches broke out along her arms and neck.

Her vision blurred. Her knees gave out beneath her.

She collapsed to the floor.

Through the haze, she thought she saw Darren move toward her, like he wanted to help. But before he could take more than a step, Winona grabbed his arm.

"Don't you dare go to her. She's just drunk, not dying. If you walk over there, we're done."

Darren stopped. He pulled Winona close, speaking in a voice just soft enough to soothe her. "Okay. I won't go."

Kayla shut her eyes. A single tear slid down her flushed cheek and hit the ground without a sound.

And then everything went black.
