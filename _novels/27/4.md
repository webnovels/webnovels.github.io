That night, Ethan dropped me off at my rented apartment.
I watched the black car disappear silently into the twilight, then opened my phone.
Nathan had posted on social media a few minutes ago.
The background was a hotel room.
Sophia was curled up asleep beside him, her lips slightly swollen and her long hair disheveled.
The caption read: "So obedient."
I looked up at the sky, taking several deep breaths to suppress the urge to break down.
I sent Nathan a message saying "We need to talk."
He didn't reply. It was as if he had died.
I knew Nathan would never come back to me.
For a whole month, Nathan completely disappeared.
Finally, I gathered my courage and sent Nathan a breakup message. I blocked him on all platforms and married Ethan.
Ethan was very busy with work and left on a business trip the day we got our marriage certificate.
After leaving the civil affairs office, Ethan had his driver take me to his villa in the city center.
He also had my things moved over from my rented apartment.
On the third day after getting married, Ethan was still out of town.
As night fell, the villa felt empty and quiet.
I turned on a small lamp and walked into the master bedroom.
The bedroom was done in gray and white, with a minimalist style and spacious layout.
The walk-in closet next door was filled with Ethan's expensive clothes and watches.
And... a few of my clothes.
At 10 PM, I heard the front door open.
Thinking Ethan was back, I opened the bedroom door. A familiar voice drifted through the crack.
It was Nathan.
"My brother's out of town. We'll stay here tonight."
I heard Sophia's breathless voice. "Nathan... I can't breathe."
Nathan's low chuckle. "You'll have plenty to endure later."
In the silent, empty night, I curled up on the bed, listening to the sounds from next door, feeling like I couldn't breathe.
When Ethan pushed open the bedroom door, my eyes were swollen from crying.
Teary-eyed, I asked, "Mr. Fu, why are you back early?"
He had his jacket draped over his arm, as if he'd come straight from the front door.
He hadn't even taken time to put away his clothes.
Travel-worn.
His body carried the chill of the night air.
"Why are you crying?" he asked.
That cool tone somehow gave me an immense sense of security.
He took off his watch and cupped my chin, leaning down. "This is your house. Why didn't you ask them to leave?"
The hot, rough touch of his fingers scorched my skin.
My ears instantly turned red.
"He's your brother..."
Ethan had been willing to cure my stammer for Nathan's sake.
What right did I have to throw out his own brother?
Just then another strange sound came from next door.
Sophia's voice was soft and coquettish.
I tried to get out of bed to find some earplugs, but in my haste I tripped over a stool.
My knees hit the floor with a thud.
"Ah..." I cried out in pain.
Next door suddenly went quiet.
Ethan sighed and bent down to pick me up. "What's the rush?"
He was carrying me out of the bedroom when suddenly there was a knock at the door.
Nathan called tentatively, "Brother... did you... bring someone home?"
The next second the doorknob started to turn.
I froze, not daring to move.
In the urgent moment, Ethan calmly supported me, pressing my back against the door.
Frightened, I quickly wrapped my arms around his neck.
Clinging to him like a koala.
Hot and cold, our body heat intermingled.
I looked down.
His clear eyes reflected hints of lazy amusement.
I had messed up his tie, exposing a small patch of his exquisite, tempting collarbone below his Adam's apple.
Ascetic yet alluring.
It was really... unfair.
"Mr. Fu..." My voice was trembling.
I suddenly realized what a suggestive position we were in.
Ethan suppressed the meaningful look in his eyes. "Can you moan?"
I shook my head.
Outside, Nathan was getting impatient. "Brother, open the door. Did you bring a woman home?"
Ethan smiled at me, but his words held no warmth. "Do I need to report my love life to you?"
He was clearly used to being dictatorial.
Nathan choked. "I thought I heard—"
"You heard wrong."
Ethan stroked down my waist, moving lower.
As my breathing grew more rapid, he asked softly: "If you can't moan, then sing."
"Don't worry, your voice sounds good."
This was the first time anyone had complimented me.
My face flushed red as I held back, not sure what came over me as I blurted out: "Little bunny, be good..."
I stopped after half a line.
Ethan was looking at me strangely.
"That line is hard to resist," he said, his voice tinged with teasing laughter.
Like a feather, tickling my heart.
I lowered my head, not daring to look at him.
My face felt hot and red.
Suddenly it went quiet outside.
Nathan's voice shook. "Brother, who exactly is your girlfriend?"
Ethan locked the door with a click.
In an unyielding tone, he said:
"Tonight is my wedding night with your sister-in-law."
"She doesn't like noise."
"So take your woman and get out."
