I rushed into the bar through the pouring rain, only to find the atmosphere inside at its peak.

Nathan was kissing his childhood sweetheart Sophia amidst the cheers of the crowd. He held her chin gently, a smile playing on his lips.

Sophia was crying, tears streaming down her face. She looked utterly pitiful.

Nathan's eyes darkened. "Still want to run away?"

She shook her head between sobs. "No more running. I just beg you not to bully me anymore."

"Good girl. Drink this, and I won't bully you," he coaxed.

I forgot to push open the door, frozen in place.

A dull ache spread through my heart, as if countless needles were being buried inside.

I had been with Nathan for three years. He was ashamed of my stammer and never brought me into his social circle.

His childhood sweetheart Sophia had abandoned the down-on-his-luck Nathan years ago to pursue opportunities abroad.

Now that she was back, Nathan immediately introduced her to all his friends.

Sophia downed a glass of strong liquor, clearly already drunk. She clung helplessly to Nathan's neck, looking utterly vulnerable.

The possessiveness in Nathan's eyes grew more intense by the second.

Before things could get worse, I chose to push open the door and enter.
