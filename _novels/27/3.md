I walked out of the bar in a daze. The sky was gray and it was still raining.
A black Bentley was parked out front.
I made my way to the car through the rain, wiping raindrops from my lashes.
The window rolled down, revealing a sharp, handsome profile.
The man inside wore a black suit that couldn't hide his noble air.
"Mr. Fu, I'm sorry to disappoint you," I said softly.
The cold man sitting in the car was Nathan's older brother and the head of the Fu family business.
Ethan.
A few months ago, he had sought me out with a straightforward proposition.
"Nathan is my brother, so I hope things go well between you two."
Presumably for the sake of his precious brother's happiness, Ethan had brought in specialists from abroad and spent a great deal of money.
That's how my stammer had gradually improved.
But now, Nathan no longer loved me.
Ethan's gaze shifted from his tablet to me. He uttered two words: "Get in."
I opened the car door, careful not to get water on the leather seats as I climbed in and huddled in the corner.
Ethan had a unique aura about him.
Dignified and reserved.
Inspiring both respect and fear.
He hung up a business call and turned to me.
"So, want to consider liking someone else?"
"What?" I met his cold, emotionless gaze, my heart tightening.
Ethan spoke as if discussing a business deal.
"You could marry me."
"Everything Nathan has, I have too. Even more."
"In terms of benefits, I'm the better choice."
Silence fell in the car after he finished speaking.
Raindrops drummed on the roof.
Like a frenzied symphony.
I hadn't processed his words yet. "Why...?"
It seemed like he was... trying to steal his own brother's girlfriend...
Ethan's lips curled slightly, his eyes still cold and clear.
"You know Grandfather is pressuring me to get married. If you're willing to help, all the better."
"As a reward, I'll give you everything you want."
"Of course, you can refuse me. I'll give you time to consider."
In that moment, I glimpsed a true businessman.
Ethan was more mature and steady than Nathan.
He knew how to control the big picture.
And how to maximize benefits.
The Fu family had saved my life.
With such an enormous debt of gratitude, I didn't seem to have grounds to refuse.
Finally, I said carefully, "I'll think about it. But if you find someone you like in the future, we should still get divorced."
Ethan's gaze returned to his tablet.
He said softly, "We'll see when the time comes."
