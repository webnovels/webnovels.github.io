Lydia was waiting to negotiate a price with me. Hearing my words, she was suddenly stunned:

"Break up? What do you mean by that?"

I replied to her indifferently:

"You said I was after your money, right?"

"Anyway, you've been tired of me for a long time. We might as well separate, so I won't be in your way."

Lydia thought I was being petty, mocking:

"Back then, you insisted on marrying into my family, and now you're using a breakup to make me compromise?"

"If you're so bold, why don't you dare to propose a divorce?"

She slammed the bowl on the table heavily, and the spilled bird's nest soup instantly scalded my hand, causing me to gasp in pain.

Hearing my pained cry, Lydia paused for a moment.

But soon, she thought I was just trying to gain sympathy and left angrily.

Watching her resolute back, I couldn't help but let out a bitter smile.

Lydia didn't know that I wasn't asking for a divorce, not because I didn't dare, but because our marriage was a sham from the start.

But since I'm leaving soon, there's nothing left to explain.

I drifted into a heavy sleep.

When I woke up again, Asher came with gifts to see me, speaking coldly:

"I heard Lydia offered 3 million for you to take the blame for me? She really loves me, huh."

I closed my eyes, not bothering to respond.

He chuckled:

"But I didn't expect someone as greedy as you to refuse?"

"The bond between you and your mom is enviably strong."

Seeing me silent, Asher leaned closer, speaking with a sinister tone:

"Jude, you still don't know, do you? Your mom transferred hospitals because of you."

Hearing him mention my mom, I looked at him sharply.

"What do you mean?"

Asher shrugged nonchalantly:

"I just said a few words to your mom, and she immediately agreed to transfer hospitals."

I was even more confused, a bad feeling rising in my heart:

"My mom wouldn't listen to you. What did you do?"

Asher, as if nothing happened, continued smiling:

"Nothing much, I just showed her the video of you being punished and eating from a dog bowl."

"I told her you were living so miserably because of her. If she truly cared for you, she should end her life immediately and stop burdening you."

"Your mom immediately agreed to the transfer and even planned to end her life when the power went out as a signal."

"Jude, to give you freedom, she suffocated herself with her own hands. Your mom went to such lengths for you, yet you're still clinging to Lydia like a leech?"

A surge of anger rushed through me, and I couldn't hold back any longer. I pulled out the needle and got out of bed, slapping him across the face:

"So it was you who drove my mom to her death! You murderer!"

Asher bit his cheek without a care, pulling out his phone to play a video, smirking:

"Jude, don't accuse me of murder. Your mom did commit suicide."

"To avoid being implicated, I set up a camera at the hospital to record everything. This video is the best evidence."

The video showed the entire process of my mom's suicide.

Tears streaming down her face, she suffocated herself.

Before her last breath, instinct made her struggle painfully. But for my freedom, she wouldn't let go, pressing on her nose and mouth until her pupils dilated, and she stopped breathing entirely.

By the end of the video, I was already in tears, my heart aching to the point of suffocation.

Asher didn't miss a chance to provoke me:

"I just said it casually, but your mom actually took it seriously!"

"What a great mother's love. I'm moved to tears!"

"Asher, you beast, I'll kill you!"

In a fit of rage, I rushed forward, grabbing his collar, ready to land another punch.

Just then, a clear, cold female voice called out from behind.

"Stop!"
