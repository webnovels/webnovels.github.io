I jumped into the ocean to save Preston Gale. After giving him CPR in front of everyone, the wedding that was meant for my cousin, Roxanne Shaw, somehow ended up being mine.

On our wedding night, he'd rather drink himself into oblivion than spend a single moment with me.

I was naive enough to hope that persistence would make him notice me.

Three years later, Roxanne returned home holding a child who looked so much like Preston that my chest froze for a second.

It was only then that I realized, while I spent that wedding night alone, he had been with her.

"Rox, I know I've put you through hell these past few years. I'll make it right. I'll make sure Lexi gives you back your place as Mrs. Gale."

I told him I was pregnant, too, hoping it would make even the slightest difference, but it didn't. He just looked at me coldly and told me to get rid of it. Then, he forced me onto an operating table, ending both of our lives in one brutal moment.

When I woke up again, I was back on the day Preston fell into the sea.

Drenched from head to toe, he was sprawled on the ground. I shouted Roxanne's name into the crowd, my voice cracking with panic.

…

Preston forced his eyes open, coughing up seawater, his voice rough. "Get away from me."

When he finally saw the person in front of him, he froze. "Rox? Why are you here?"

He looked around and spotted me off to the side, just as drenched as he was.

In my past life, I had jumped in without a second thought and saved him with everything I had. However, the moment he woke up, he pushed me away like I was something filthy. Disgust was written all over his face. He had someone bring him towels and water. Then, right in front of everyone, he rinsed his mouth and wiped his lips like I'd contaminated him.

However, now…

Roxanne kneeled beside him, her expression a mix of worry and shy hesitation. She brushed her fingers over her lips, pretending she didn't know what to say.

Preston understood instantly. He didn't say a word.

He simply let Roxanne help him up and walked off with her, not sparing me even a glance.

I knew he'd been drugged before he fell into the sea.

In my previous life, he'd found the culprit soon enough.

I didn't need to play messenger this time.

The seawater had been ice cold. By that night, I was burning with fever.

There was a knock at the door.

My mind was foggy, but the moment I opened the door and saw Preston, everything snapped into focus. "Why are you here?"

He leaned lazily against the doorframe, giving me a disinterested look. "Lexi Shaw, what trick are you pulling now?"

I stared at him, confused. "I don't know what you're talking about."

He let out a cold, mocking laugh. "You yelled for Rox to give me CPR in front of everyone. Does her reputation mean nothing to you? How can you be so selfish?"

A suffocating pressure built in my chest. I wanted to ask Preston what exactly he expected me to do.

I couldn't save him myself, and I wasn't allowed to call the woman he actually cared about.

Maybe I should've just let him drown.

"Think whatever you want." I sniffed and steadied my voice. "If there's nothing else, I'd like to rest. I don't really feel well."

He probably thought I was putting on an act, trying to get sympathy. His lip curled.

"Are you playing hard to get? Lexi, your tricks just keep evolving. If you're not feeling well, take some medicine. I'm not a doctor."

As he walked away, I sighed.

Everyone in Novaton knew how much I liked him. I'd thrown my pride out the window for it.

He said he liked women with long, straight hair, so I grew mine out from childhood and never once changed the style. Since he liked light-colored clothes, I never wore dark ones again. He preferred quiet, elegant women, so I turned down invitation after invitation from friends and stayed home practicing piano, painting, and other refined arts.

However, after everything I went through in my last life, I finally realized the truth.

Everything he said he liked about a woman was just what Roxanne already had. He liked her. That was all it ever was.

And no matter how hard I tried or how much I changed myself, I still wasn't worth even a glance from him.

Before long, word spread everywhere that Roxanne was the one who'd given Preston CPR.

The cruise party was hosted by the Gale family. After Preston's accident, panic swept through the ship.

A group of security guards found me. "Ms. Shaw, please cooperate with our investigation."

They said that since I was the first to discover he'd fallen into the water, I was the primary suspect.

"I saved him," I said in disbelief.

One of them looked apologetic. "Mr. Gale said we can't rule out the possibility you staged the whole thing to use it to your advantage."

I froze.

To my advantage?

So that was what he thought of me.

They dragged me to a storage room and locked the door, ignoring my protests that it was illegal.

Their only response was that Preston would take responsibility. "He said no one is allowed to let you out until the truth is confirmed."

And just like that, I was locked up for twenty-four hours, burning with fever. Without food or water, I finally collapsed.

Through the haze, I felt a pair of strong, unyielding arms lift me up.
