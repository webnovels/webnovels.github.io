After leaving, I went to a hair salon.
I cut off the long hair I had grown for three years.
When my new short blue hair appeared, I felt like I was becoming myself again.
I also got a new tattoo on my wrist: "Je ne recule jamais".
It's French, meaning "I never back down".
Finally, I went to a shop I hadn't visited in three years.
"Kevin, bring out my bike."
A shirtless, muscular man walked out of the shop.
He looked at me in surprise, his eyes reddening.
It took him a moment to react: "Miss... Vivian?"
"Yeah. It's me."
The tall guy, standing over six feet, looked me up and down, stumbling over his words:
"Miss Vivian, how... why are you here?"
I looked at the two bikes displayed in the most prominent position.
One white, one black. I smiled: "They're still here."
"Miss Vivian, I polish these two bikes every day. They're as good as new. You can ride anytime. Where do you want to go? Should I call the guys?"
I shook my head: "Just bring it out. I want to go for a ride alone."
"Okay."
As I got on the bike, a long-forgotten feeling washed over me.
It had been so long since I'd ridden.
It was as if by not riding, I could forget what happened that summer.
I looked back at the black Kawasaki, thinking of him.
Kevin followed my gaze, his eyes reddening: "I've been waiting for Ryan too. I've kept his bike here, untouched, next to yours. I always thought that one day, they'd hit the road again together."
"Miss Vivian, it's been three years. I've waited for you to come back. Will he come back too?"
I paused for a moment.
Has it really been three years?
"They say if you listen to 'The Clock of the Opposite Direction' 1000 times, you can see the person you miss. I've finished listening, but why hasn't Ryan come back?"
I turned my head, feeling a sting in my nose, but still gently comforted him: "That's just a myth. The dead can't come back to life."
Then I started the motorcycle.
Kevin didn't know that I had already listened to it 10,000 times.
I rode all the way to the mountaintop, looking down at the scenery below, I shouted: "Ryan Wild, I did as you said and tried to marry well. Why aren't you back yet?"
Tears rolled down my cheeks.
"Liar, you said you wanted to see me in a wedding dress. Look, in the end, I can only wear it for you."
"But it doesn't fit. I've been eating well and living properly, why doesn't it fit?"
"Can you hold me? The wind is so strong, and I'm so tired."
On the empty mountaintop, there was an endless sea of stars.
The moon cast a soft light over the entire landscape.
Everything became gentle.
Behind me, there was a rustling sound.
I turned around abruptly, but there was no one there.
It was just the sound of insects.
