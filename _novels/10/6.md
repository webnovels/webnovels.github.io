"Ryan, you're finally back. I've missed you so much."
My voice trembled, my body even shaking slightly.
"Why are you crying? Come here, let me hold you."
I rushed forward.
But what I saw was Kevin pushing the bike towards me: "Miss Vivian, why are you crying?"
"Didn't Ryan always say his bike should never be alone without yours? So when you rode off, I brought out his bike and started it up."
Oh.
It was just my imagination earlier.
I turned away, wiping my tears.
Some say you shouldn't meet someone too amazing when you're young, or everyone you meet afterwards will pale in comparison.
My obsession ran too deep.
For the past three years, I hadn't faced reality, still praying for a miracle to happen.
