I was at the bridal shop for my final fitting.
In two weeks, I was supposed to marry Lucas Gray.
Although the wedding dress was custom-made, it felt a bit tight around the chest and waist.
As I went to the fitting room to adjust it, I suddenly heard voices growing clearer outside:
"Hey, did you hear? Lucas Gray's ex-girlfriend, Sophia Miller, just got divorced and returned to the country."
"I remember when she broke up with Lucas three years ago, he was utterly devastated."
"Indeed. If Vivian Reed hadn't suddenly appeared and helped him through that dark time, who knows if he'd have ever recovered."
"Who's Vivian Reed again? Oh right, the most rebellious princess of high society! I can't believe she actually tamed herself for Lucas Gray."
"But now that Sophia is back, do you think the wedding will still happen?"
"The invitations have already been sent out. If it falls through, won't they become the laughingstock of our circles?"
...
After their voices faded, I took off the ill-fitting wedding dress.
I called Lucas.
He didn't answer, but amidst the background noise, I heard his voice:
"She's just a poor imitation. Vivian can't even compare to Sophia's little finger."
Someone else chimed in: "But Vivian used to be known as hard to chase and even harder to tame. Bro, you should be satisfied."
Lucas scoffed: "How hard to tame? For the past three years, she's been following me around like a puppy."
"Well, you still ended up engaged to her."
"Bro, don't you like her?"
Lucas's voice turned cold: "Would you like a dog?"
Someone in the crowd continued to ask: "Then why are you marrying her?"
There was a moment of silence.
After a while, I heard Lucas's voice again: "It's amusing to see such a wild girl become docile. It's fun to play with her."
I hung up the phone.
Looking at my long, straight black hair in the mirror.
And the faded tattoos on my arms and collarbone.
I suddenly smiled.
I've had enough of playing this good girl act.
