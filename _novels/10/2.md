Lucas didn't come home for a week.
I listed our marital home on a real estate platform.
Every brick and tile in this place was bought by me.
I didn't want any of it anymore.
After finishing up, I finally received his call asking to meet.
He had arranged the gathering but was the last to arrive.
When he came in, the fragile and pitiful Sophia Miller was trailing behind him.
She looked about 50% similar to how I looked now.
He held her hand tightly, as if protecting her from any harm, his protective stance unmistakable.
The air suddenly became still.
No one dared to speak.
All eyes turned to me.
I remained silent, looking down at the red string bracelet on my wrist that was almost worn through.
I smirked slightly.
Until Lucas brought her in front of me: "Vivian, I'm calling off the wedding."
I lifted my eyes slightly, calmly looking at him: "You want to break the engagement?"
He held Sophia tighter, looking at her adoringly: "Sophia's back. I don't want to settle."
"No matter how hard you try to imitate her, you'll never measure up."
"Do you understand? I don't love you."
I nodded: "Mm-hmm."
He looked at me in disbelief, as if my calm reaction wasn't what he expected.
"You know our parents arranged this marriage."
"I loved Sophia for five years and waited for her for three. She's been hurt deeply, and I want to give her a home."
I was getting impatient and grabbed my bag from beside me: "Okay, are you done?"
Lucas paused, silent for a moment before continuing: "I'll handle things with my family. You deal with yours. We won't be getting married next week."
"Alright."
I stood up and walked towards the exit.
As I reached the door, Lucas suddenly called out: "Vivian?"
I turned back.
He was still standing in the same spot, but I noticed his free hand clenched tightly at his side.
"Anything else?"
He frowned: "Don't you have anything to say to me?"
I thought for a moment. I actually wanted to say that I envied him.
His first love could come back, but mine never would.
In the end, I just said calmly: "Congratulations on your new marriage."
As I closed the door, I heard voices behind me: "Seriously? That's all the reaction Vivian has?"
"Lucas, didn't you say she was madly in love with you? Why isn't she making a scene?"
"Shut up." It was Lucas's angry voice.
I didn't look back.
I should have realized earlier that no matter how similar Lucas was, he wasn't Ryan.
Ryan would never have abandoned me for someone else.
