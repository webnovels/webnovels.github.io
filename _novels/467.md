I've been married to Jack for twelve years. My millionaire husband has fallen in love with the new receptionist at his company.

She's nearly forty, not as pretty as me, and doesn't have as good a figure as I do. Yet in just six short months, she's provided Jack with tremendous emotional value.

Jack wearily said to me:

"If we divorce, you can have the house and the car. Olivia, can you please just let me go?"

I lowered my eyes and said softly, "Alright."

Then I bought a calendar and circled a date.

Divorce countdown: 30 days.
