"Hazel, look, my baby is kicking!"

"It must be an active child in the future."

When I opened my eyes, I saw my best friend Mia's face.

She was stroking her belly, looking very happy.

I knew I had been reborn.

An active stillborn? That's just self-deception.

I didn't expose her, I just went along with it.

"Your child will definitely be healthy, lively and cute like you in the future."

Mia was so flattered that she couldn't stop smiling, lowering her head to stroke her belly.

I took out my phone and took a selfie of us to post on social media.

"My best friend and I are about to give birth, wishing us luck~"

In my previous life, I had a low-key pregnancy, which gave Mia the opportunity to act.

Mia tried to grab my phone to delete it, but I stopped her.

"What's wrong, Mia? I want everyone to witness the most important moment of my life."

I asked her.

Mia looked at me nervously, but there was some malice in her eyes.

Her expression was so obvious, it was almost written on her face, yet in my previous life I hadn't noticed at all.

Mia and I had been good friends since high school.

We even went to the same university and remained inseparable best friends.

I met my current husband Lucas and fell in love with him.

Mia then pestered me to introduce her to someone from the Evans family, and it just so happened that Lucas had a brother five years younger than him.

We got married into the Evans family on the same day, and everyone said it was double happiness.

I even thought that Mia and I were sisters as close as blood.

We even had the same due date.

The thoughtful Mia had already arranged the delivery room, just waiting for the day of delivery.

Who would have thought that this was the beginning of my descent into the abyss.

After I bled to death, my soul lingered around my biological child, unable to leave.

It wasn't until I heard Mia and her husband's plot that I understood the truth of the matter.

Mia had already found out that her fetus was stillborn during pregnancy, and the doctor had suggested that she terminate the pregnancy.

Although her doctor had repeatedly advised her to terminate the pregnancy, she still stubbornly dragged it out for two months.

The purpose was to completely switch our children on the day of delivery.

The Evans Group had two sons, one was Lucas and the other was Dylan.

Lucas had been well-educated since childhood and was particularly adept at finance.

Dylan, on the other hand, was an uneducated playboy.

Anyone with eyes could see who was smarter, so they had been grooming Lucas as the successor since childhood.

Dylan originally understood these arrangements and was aware of his own shortcomings.

But Mia had been constantly brainwashing him, causing Dylan to be very dissatisfied and jealous of Lucas.

So, she extended her poisonous hand to the children.

She knew that old Mr. Evans valued the continuation of the family line the most.

Because the hospital and delivery room were all arranged by her, she had arranged her own people around me.

It was all for the plan to go smoothly.

After the anesthesia took effect on me, she sent someone to take my child away and put her stillborn baby on my bed.

If I hadn't heard it with my own ears, I wouldn't have believed that Mia, who was like a sister to me, would do such a vicious thing to me!

After the confinement period, she even came to show off in front of me with the baby, looking very smug.

Finally, when I was arguing with her, she pushed me onto a fruit knife, causing me to bleed to death.

The death of the child and wife caused Lucas to be forced to step down, and he eventually died of depression.

The life that should have belonged to us was stolen by Mia and Dylan.

Thinking of this, I was furious.

This pair of shameless dogs!

In this life, I not only want them to pay blood for blood, but I also want them to pay back double!

Calculating the time, I would probably give birth in about a week.

I quickly sent a message to Lucas, urging him to come home early tonight.

It was the same in my previous life, Mia stopped me.

She said: "The heir is so busy, let me, your best friend, arrange it for you."

"Men are not as close as best friends."

At that time, I believed her nonsense, so I ended up with a broken family.

Now, Mia wanted to grab my phone again.

"The heir is so busy..."

I made a stop gesture to stop her.

"You shouldn't have such a strong possessiveness over someone else's husband."

"After all, I'm carrying his child."

These two light sentences choked her red-faced.

"Hazel, how can you think of me like this!"

She was powerless to argue.

I turned and left directly.
