After Lucas came home, I told him about the experiences of these two lives.

I originally thought he would question me, but he directly hugged me.

"You finally came back to me."

After a conversation, I found out that Lucas had also been reborn.

Heaven has eyes, giving us a chance to start over.

But we knew that we could only outsmart them, not confront them directly.

Dylan was born to Lucas's stepmother, who is now Mrs. Evans.

She holds the vast majority of the shares and is the largest shareholder.

So we two need to be more cautious in our actions.

The next day, I made an appointment with Mia to go for a prenatal check-up together.

As soon as I saw her, I affectionately linked arms with her.

"Mia, I'm sorry, I was too harsh last time."

She looked surprised on the surface, but revealed pride and disdain.

"It's okay, we're family, I don't mind."

Hearing these words, I almost vomited.

"Let's go."

I walked arm in arm with her in one direction.

"Where are we going? Aren't we going for a prenatal check-up? The hospital is that way."

Mia was confused, pointing to the other side.

That was her private hospital, where everyone inside and out was her people.

I smiled and dispelled her doubts.

"We're going to another one, it's run by a friend of mine from when I studied abroad."

Mia's face turned pale, and she stood still.

"Let's go to the original one, I'm not used to new doctors giving me check-ups."

She clung to my arm, begging.

I patted her shoulder earnestly and persuaded her kindly: "Mia, I'm doing this for your own good."

Seeing that I had said this much, it would be particularly strange if she kept refusing.

She had no choice but to get in the car with me.

Her face was getting paler, and even her hands were shaking uncontrollably.

So she's also afraid of being exposed.

"Mia, what's wrong?" I asked her concernedly.

"I feel a bit dizzy and nauseous."

After saying this, she actually fainted directly.

So I hurriedly sent Mia to the hospital.

Half an hour later, all the Evans family members came.

It seems that the Evans family still cherishes this daughter-in-law quite a bit.

I asked the doctor to conceal the news of the stillbirth and only say that the fetal heartbeat was weak.

After all, in this life, I want her to fall the hardest when she's at her most得意.

After Mia woke up and heard this news, she finally breathed a sigh of relief.

Only the look in her eyes towards me had a hint of inquiry.

I sat at Mia's bedside, crying and saying: "Mia, I've always told you not to work so hard."

"Look at you, what if I wasn't here today, what would have happened!"

Crying and speaking, as if I was really worried about her.

Hearing me say this, Mrs. Evans couldn't help but scold: "Hazel is right, since you're pregnant, you shouldn't worry too much, some things should be left to the servants to do."

"Not only will it tire you out, but it will also hurt my little grandson."

The last sentence was inevitably emphasized.

Mia's face didn't look good, but she could only agree.

Great, this way no one can interfere with me.

Mia lowered her eyes, but she still secretly glared at me.

"Mia, don't worry, you're my best sister, I'll help if I can."

"Just don't tire yourself out again, I'm afraid next time it won't be just a weak fetal heartbeat."

I grabbed Mia's hand and patiently persuaded her.

"Weak fetal heartbeat!"

Mrs. Evans questioned loudly, then said through gritted teeth: "From now on, you'll stay at home to nurse your pregnancy, don't go anywhere!"

It was clear that she also cherished this unborn child very much.

Then, to maintain the dignity of Mrs. Evans.

"Hazel, you shouldn't tire yourself out either."

"Thank you, Mom, I'll be careful."

Mia still lowered her head, not daring to speak.

When they all dispersed, Mia called out to me.

"You deliberately embarrassed me, didn't you!"

She glared at me with a black face and questioned harshly.

I quickly put on a concerned face and apologized: "Mia, I'm doing this all for your own good..."

Mia spoke in a sharp tone, excitedly: "I've been confined, are you satisfied now!"

Of course I'm satisfied.
