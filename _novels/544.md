It was three years after my death when my wife, Seraphina Hayes, demanded my kidney for her childhood sweetheart, Julian Thorne, again.

She arrived at my old place, donation papers clutched in her hand, only to find strangers living there.

Desperate, she tracked down my landlord, Mr. Henderson, to find out where I’d gone.

But he just told her:

“Liam? He’s long gone! Heard he died from a full-body infection after a kidney surgery. Couldn't afford the meds, so he just... faded away.”

Seraphina scoffed, refusing to believe him. She accused Mr. Henderson of being in cahoots with me, trying to trick her.

Her brow furrowed, and she sneered coldly:

“It was just a kidney donation, wasn’t it? How could someone *die* from that?!”

“Tell him this: if I don’t see him at the hospital tomorrow, he can forget about getting another penny of child support for that kid!”

With that, she stormed off, radiating fury.

Mr. Henderson watched her retreating figure, then sighed, a weary sadness in his voice:

“But that child… he died from his illness a long time ago too. His ashes are still at the funeral home, unclaimed.”
