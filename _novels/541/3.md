A month ago, news came from Country A that there had been a breakthrough in treating my rare disease. They asked if I would be willing to volunteer for their drug development program.

I didn't agree at first for the sake of the babies, but they said this was a rare opportunity that might offer a chance for successful treatment.

Perhaps out of a desire to survive, I inexplicably kept their contact information, not realizing it would come in handy now.

I messaged them, and they quickly responded, agreeing to accept me as a volunteer for their research team.

Thinking of the babies in my belly, I called my brother Ryan, using pregnancy mood swings as an excuse to say I wanted to travel alone to Dali.

As expected, as soon as the call connected, I was met with a rebuke.

"You're already six months along and still can't settle down? What if something happens to the babies? You're being ridiculous."

I didn't care about his reaction. I only told him to prevent them from searching for me too quickly and interfering with my plans if I suddenly disappeared.

But I didn't expect that my brother, who usually couldn't be bothered with me, would show up at my door.

"Chloe, can't you understand the situation? Do you know how important these babies are?"

Seeing his unusual behavior, my heart sank, but I forced myself to ask, "How important?"

His eyes flickered, and he continued, "Babies conceived after so many IVF attempts - you know better than I do how important they are."

"Then do you know that I'm sick, and these babies might cost me my life?"

He blurted out without thinking, "The Jiang family has access to the best medical teams. Don't scare yourself. It's not good for the babies."

Just then, Lucas pushed open the door, reeking of alcohol and carrying a bag of supplements.

As soon as he entered, he handed me the bag, saying, "Chloe, I'm back!"

"These are from Olivia. She says they're good for the babies. She's so eager to be an aunt."

Eager indeed! Olivia, who had always been dissatisfied with me, was now sending supplements, baby clothes, and even imported bird's nest soup that she used to say I didn't deserve - all because of these two babies.

As the Jiang family's biological daughter, I could only enjoy what should have been rightfully mine through the babies' influence.

And even that was just scraps from an impostor.

How ironic!

Lucas noticed Ryan and visibly startled before affectionately patting my hair.

"It's getting late. You should go rest. I'll sleep in the study tonight to avoid the alcohol smell bothering you."

The lipstick mark on his collar was glaringly obvious, and the alcohol smell was mixed with Olivia's signature perfume, making me nauseous.

I didn't say anything, just took the bag and hurried back to the bedroom. I heard him say to Ryan,

"Ryan, you've come at the right time. I have some business to discuss with you about that land in the west of the city."

Seeing the two of them heading straight for the study, I threw the bag on the bed and quietly walked to the study door.

The first thing I heard was Ryan's voice: "Did you slip up about the babies? Why is she suddenly saying she's in a bad mood and wants to travel alone?"

"You know she always puts the babies first. She's never mentioned anything risky before."

Lucas pondered for a moment: "It's impossible. Maybe it's just hormones affecting her. You're overreacting. These are Olivia's babies. I've been very careful. There's no way she could have found out..."

I couldn't hear the rest of what he said. My vision blurred.

My suspicions were correct. Ryan knew the truth too!

Everyone knew. Only I was fooled like an idiot.

Whether it's the babies, Lucas, or my family, I don't want any of it this time.
