The truth was so cruel it bordered on absurdity, making me flee home like an escapee, my thoughts in chaos.

I received another anonymous video on my phone, showing the continuation of the scene in the private room.

One of Lucas's followers suddenly asked, "Do you think if we tell Chloe the babies aren't hers right after she gives birth, she'll be so shocked she ends up in critical condition?"

"You know, she seems to genuinely love Lucas. She's willing to have kids while sick. It's a shame she can't read the room. Lucas and Olivia have been childhood sweethearts. Who does she think she is, barging in between them!"

Another person chimed in, "It would be quite a show if we really told her. She'd probably have a breakdown."

Lucas slowly exhaled a smoke ring and said leisurely, "If you want to know how she'll react, we can try it when the time comes. Maybe she'll find out before giving birth."

The others mocked, "Even if she finds out early, she'll still have to give birth. They're Lucas's children after all. She doesn't have the guts to anger Lucas."

"True, she's as pliable as clay and such a bootlicker to Lucas. Back then, she was so eager to secure the marriage that she constantly groveled before Lucas."

Olivia teased from the side, "You guys seem so concerned about Chloe. Why don't one of you try pursuing her after Lucas divorces her? She's been starved for affection since childhood, so she's easy to handle. Plus, she's about to be a divorced woman with a short life expectancy, so you won't have to worry about long-term commitment."

"Speaking of which, she's carrying twins. Her belly looks terrifying. I wonder what she'll look like after giving birth!"

Upon hearing this, the men all expressed disgust and quickly refused.

"No thanks, I don't want that kind of blessing. Just looking at that belly, I'm afraid I'd have nightmares for half a month."

"Don't joke like that. There are so many pretty girls out there waiting for my attention!"

They spoke crudely, but Lucas just smiled faintly, seemingly indifferent.

With a "thud," my phone fell to the ground. I didn't realize when my back had broken out in a cold sweat.

Only then did I discover that I had never truly seen the man who spoke to me so gently and cared for me so attentively by my side.

I remember when the IVF was successful, Lucas's face was full of excitement and concern.

He carefully touched my belly and said softly, "Don't trouble Mommy, okay?"

He would also invite a bunch of chefs to prepare various dishes for me when I had morning sickness and swelling.

"Chloe, pregnancy is hard on you. For the sake of the babies, think about what you'd like to eat. Whatever you want, I'll make it happen."

"These two troublemakers, when they're born, I'll definitely help you discipline them."

I thought he cared about me, but now I know it was all for the babies.

Do they all think I'll resign myself to giving birth to these children? Well, this time, I refuse.
