Mr. Carter’s face was grim as he yanked me up.

Mrs. Carter blocked the other guests’ view.

“Alice, we’ve given you a good life, good food, and good care, and you’re still playing the victim to tarnish your sister’s reputation? How can you be so thoughtless!”

Mrs. Carter’s harsh voice startled me. I pulled away from Mr. Carter’s hand and knelt on the floor, trembling uncontrollably: “I’m sorry, I won’t dare again, never again…”

Seeing my breakdown, Mrs. Carter softened her tone and held me, soothing me. I finally calmed down.

The engagement ceremony continued.

The engaged couple went around to toast. When they reached our table, after my parents offered their blessings, Jessica and Liam’s eyes fell on me: “Miss Alice, don’t you have any blessings for your sister and her fiancé?”

Liam’s familiar voice echoed above my head.

My fingers were tangled in Pippin’s leash, and I dared not move.

After a long moment, Liam sneered.

“Forget it. Your blessings disgust me.”

“Woof woof…”

Pippin barked a couple of times, as if comforting me.

I whimpered back, then grabbed Liam as he was about to leave.

“Mr. Hayes…”

“Miss Alice, did I give you permission to speak?”

Liam shook off my hand, his face etched with impatience.

My parents also looked tense.

I mustered every ounce of courage, pulled an aluminum can ring from my bag.

“The ring you gave me, returning what’s yours.”

Liam and I were childhood sweethearts.

Everyone once thought we were a match made in heaven.

They all assumed we would naturally end up together.

We thought so too.

On my eighteenth birthday, Liam, blushing fiercely, handed me an aluminum can ring.

He said it was a token of our love, and his early wedding ring for me.

He told me not to like anyone else.

I listened to him.

I never imagined Liam would be the first to betray me.

Jessica’s appearance completely stole Liam’s heart. From that day on, all our vows and promises were nothing but a fragile bubble, scattered by the wind.

I cried, I threw tantrums.

Finally, I understood it was all a cruel, empty dream.

Love was a luxury I couldn’t afford.

“Alice…”

Mrs. Carter awkwardly pulled me back.

Liam, however, chuckled softly and took the aluminum can ring. As I watched, he casually tossed it to the ground.

“It was just a childish joke. Such a cheap trinket. I never thought Miss Alice would actually take it seriously and keep it for so long?”

His words made me feel like a complete joke.

My cheeks burned instantly.

“Woof woof…”

Pippin barked a couple of times, making me quickly lower my head, so I didn’t have to scramble blindly under Liam’s knowing, mocking gaze.

After the ceremony, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.

I also returned to my old job.

To my surprise, my first client was Jessica.

She ignored Pippin’s warning growls and stood too close to me.

“Little sister, it seems two years in the mountains have made you much more obedient. You actually watched Liam and me get engaged without a fuss.”

Jessica’s taunt left me expressionless.

Two years in the mountains had taught me that love came at a price.

Liam’s love had too high a price; I couldn’t afford it.

Seeing no reaction from me, her frustration flared into anger: “Alice, don’t think playing the victim at the engagement party will earn you sympathy. I’m telling you, Dad and Mom will marry you off to some faraway place sooner or later!”

“You’d better keep up this act!”

I didn’t reply, my gaze fixed on her wrist.

There was a faint scar from her suicide attempt.

It was because of that scar that I was thrown into the mountains for two years, enduring unspeakable torment.

I still remembered Jessica’s suicide note:

“Little sister, please don’t torment me anymore. I’m giving Dad, Mom, and Liam to you. From now on, I hope you’ll take good care of them.”

By the time I snapped back, Pippin had actually chased Jessica out of the room.

As I rushed out, I heard Jessica shriek, collapsing to the ground, clutching her blood-soaked leg.
