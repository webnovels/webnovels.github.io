It was the third year of my marriage to my arch-nemesis, Leo Maxwell, when a new intern accidentally spilled water all over our marriage certificate on his desk.

Panicked, I rushed to the County Clerk’s Office to get a replacement.

But the staff told me the certificate was fake.

I went back to the office, ready to confront Leo.

That’s when I saw him, pinning the intern, Felicity Reed, against the door for a passionate kiss.

“We’ve been fighting for five years, but I’ve been secretly in love with you for ten,” he whispered to her.

“Our real marriage certificate? I’ve had it safely stored in my personal safe all along.”

Even when Felicity pushed me down the stairs, leaving me bleeding and bruised, Leo just stood there, watching coldly.

He cradled Felicity in his arms, murmuring comforting words.

“Don’t look, you’re afraid of blood.”

Later, due to delayed emergency treatment, I suffered a cognitive impairment.

When I finally opened my eyes again,

My memory was stuck on the year I hated him the most.
