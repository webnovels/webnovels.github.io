My first day as an intern, and the new intern who started with me claimed she was the CEO's fiancée.

Naturally, she became the department's golden child.

Our manager, Mr. Davies, was so eager to kiss up to her, he rallied everyone to chip in a thousand bucks each for a grand wedding gift on the big day.

Everyone meekly agreed, except for me. I just shook my head. “It’s *my* wedding, so I guess I don’t need to contribute to the gift, right?”

The office erupted in laughter:

“*Your* wedding? Seriously, the nerve of some people! Mrs. Sterling is right here!”

“I saw her Ins full of posts crushing on Mr. Sterling. Is she, like, totally delusional?”

“Seriously, she’s got some nerve, utterly shameless.”

Jessica tried to smooth things over. “Let’s not be too hard on her. Maybe she needs that thousand bucks to eat.”

I calmly replied, “Since you’re all so chummy with her, I assume you’re all invited to the wedding in a few days?”

Jessica panicked. “How about you just transfer the money to me? The wedding tables are probably all booked. Once I’m done, Mr. Sterling and I will treat you all to dinner.”

Watching her keep up the act, I turned around and sent wedding invitations to every single colleague. I couldn’t wait to see their faces when they realized *I* was the one in the wedding gown.
