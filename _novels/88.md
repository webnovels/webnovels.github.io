My mom is an amateur archaeologist with questionable ethics.

She insisted on taking the whole family grave-digging on the summer solstice, claiming it was the day with the strongest positive energy of the year.

We didn't find any antiques, but we did unearth a thousand-year-old vampire.

My family pushed me forward as a sacrifice to be the vampire's groom.

They thought the vampire queen would drain me dry and kill me.

But not only did I survive, the vampire queen also helped me find many valuable antiques.

My brother Ryan saw me with all the antiques and got jealous. He used a homemade bomb to kill me.

When I opened my eyes again, we were back on the day my mom dug up the thousand-year-old vampire.

This time, Ryan volunteered to be the vampire's groom.

I secretly laughed.

Did he really think sleeping in a coffin with a vampire every day and having his energy drained was a good thing?
