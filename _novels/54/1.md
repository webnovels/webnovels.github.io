Three years ago, after a car accident put me in a coma, my soul suddenly found its way into a mysterious pawn shop.

The owner asked if I was willing to trade my intelligence.

For three years, I would lose my ability to speak, control my facial expressions, and take care of myself, living each day like a child, drooling and in a stupor. In return, Fiona's breast cancer would be completely healed.

For Fiona's sake, I agreed without hesitation.

When I woke up, Fiona's cancer was miraculously gone.

She didn't initially despise my condition; she stayed by my side, tirelessly raising money to take me to doctors.

But by the second year, she changed.

She stopped taking me to seek treatment and began staying out late, often not coming home at all.

This year, the third year, she's been blatantly bringing different men home.

As I was lost in thought, the door clicked open.

Fiona returned with a new man.

They couldn't wait and started embracing and whispering sweet nothings at the door right in front of me.

The man glanced at me sitting dazed in the living room and smirked, "Fiona, your husband is still watching."

"Ignore him!" Fiona said dismissively, "He's a fool, he doesn't understand anything. Let him watch!"

I stared at them blankly, feeling as if needles were piercing my heart.

Yes, I'm a fool.

Even though my mind is clear, I can't speak or control my expressions. Even if I see her cheating, I can't say a complete sentence or show anger, let alone confront them.

I can only watch them foolishly like a child.

I clenched my fists tightly, my eyes turning red with intense anger.

The man frowned, "Fiona, your husband is crying. Are you sure he doesn’t understand?"

"He's been like a child since he became like this, crying often. I'm used to it."

Fiona was indifferent.

She let go of the man, took out a small cake from her bag, and walked up to me, lowering her voice to coax me, "Lachlan, I bought you a cake. Go to the room and eat the cake."

When I first became impaired, Fiona often used cake to cheer me up.

Even though I couldn't express my pain, her company made life feel sweet.

But now, looking at the cake in front of me, it just felt incredibly ironic.

I couldn't accept her betrayal. With all my strength, I knocked the cake from her hand, stubbornly grabbing her hand, incoherently shouting like a child, "Lachlan cake, don't want... Fiona don't be with him... be with me..."

"Enough!" Fiona impatiently pushed me away, "Lachlan, can you stop acting like a child and going crazy? I'm really fed up! I'm a person too, I get tired, I need love, and I have my own needs! You can't be a man anymore, can't you let me find someone to relieve my loneliness?"

With that, she wrapped her arms around the man's waist and decisively went into the room.

And I stumbled, falling to the ground.

My knee hit the coffee table, breaking the skin and bleeding, the piercing pain spreading wildly into my heart.
