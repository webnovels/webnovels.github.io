Olivia's Nightmare: An intern named Rachel used some kind of "deposit transfer" on me. No matter how much money I put in my account, the balance would always become $50.

In my previous life, I dreamed of buying a house near the company. I finally saved up $50,000 for a down payment.

But when I tried to make the payment, the real estate agent told me my balance was insufficient.

I checked my bank statements, questioned the bank, and even went to the police, but everyone treated me like I was crazy.

Because my bank statements showed every transaction clearly.

But I never made those purchases! I've always been so frugal!

I called my parents in tears, but they just scolded me:

"Olivia, are you making excuses for becoming a spendthrift?"

"You're could you make up such a ridiculous story! If you want money from us, just say it. No need to lie."

When I told my coworkers about this, after looking at my bank statements, some of the guys even joked:

"Olivia's spending thousands at a certain bar late at night. That price matches up perfectly with hiring male escorts!"

Faced with all these misunderstandings, my explanations were useless.

I anonymously posted about this online, but netizens all commented that I was making things up for attention.

Only one comment suggested I observe if anyone around me had spending that matched my statements.

After careful observation, I indeed noticed that whenever Rachel, the new intern in our department, made a purchase, a deduction would appear in my account.

Even buying a drink would show up immediately.

After confirming my target, I confronted Rachel directly. But she just laughed at me, saying I was spending recklessly and trying to blame others when I couldn't save money. She said I must be going crazy.

She even colluded with other colleagues and me sent to a mental hospital.

After two years of torture in the hospital, I couldn't take it anymore and escaped to jump into a river.

But when never expected that when I opened my eyes again, I'd be back to the day before I was going to buy the house.
