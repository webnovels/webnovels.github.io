I drafted my resignation letter and submitted it. Within minutes, Jasper stormed into my office in anger.

"Lydia, why are you resigning?"

I almost forgot, my father had already announced that he would hand the company over to my brother. Jasper is now the newly appointed director.

"I actually..."

I wanted to say I was leaving, secretly hoping Jasper might not want me to go.

"Jasper, did you forget? She's a privileged young lady, now trying to use the child to bind you, so she can continue to enjoy life as Mrs. Jasper."

The hint of unease in Jasper's eyes was quickly replaced by disgust.

He grabbed a stack of tissues, wiping his hands that had touched mine repeatedly.

"I almost forgot you're the daughter of a mistress, always relying on men for a free ride."

He signed the resignation letter and then threw it in my face.

But I couldn't focus on his humiliating actions because I saw the familiar jade pendant around Keira's neck.

It was the protective jade pendant I had prayed for Jasper, step by step, on the Tibetan Sky Road.

I pointed to the pendant, my voice trembling, "Who gave that to you?"

Keira smiled triumphantly, her eyes filled with tender affection as she looked at Jasper.

Jasper seemed momentarily dazed but quickly sneered.

"Keira has always been in poor health. I gave it to her for protection, so what?"

Ignoring him, I grabbed the pendant, determined to tear it from Keira's neck.

"Ah! Lydia, you lunatic!"

Jasper couldn't protect her in time, and in the struggle, I pulled the pendant off, and Keira hit the table.

She held her head, tears glistening.

"Jasper, my head is spinning."

Jasper's face darkened instantly, snatching the pendant and holding Keira protectively.

"What you gave me is mine. Who I give it to is none of your business."

His furious voice drew the attention of several colleagues.

"Isn't Miss Lydia Mr. Jasper's girlfriend? Why is he holding Keira?"

"I heard Keira and Mr. Jasper are childhood sweethearts. Did Lydia come between them? Didn't I hear something about a mistress?"

"Could be. Maybe Mr. Jasper was just tolerating the young lady for the director's position and now wants to pursue true love."

Jasper gave a signal with his eyes, and people quickly dispersed.

"Lydia, curb your spoiled young lady temper!"

"Keira is not like your mother, who only knows how to be a mistress. Her family helped my mom and me during our toughest times. I won't let you bully her."

"I'll have her move into our house. You'll take care of her until her head stops spinning."

I bit my lip hard, holding back tears, watching Jasper leave with Keira in his arms.

That night, Keira couldn't wait to move in.

She stood proudly at the stairwell, fiddling with the jade pendant.

"Do you want it? Come and get it. I don't care."

She tossed it, and the pendant was about to hit the ground.

I reached out to catch it. In a split second, I felt a push and tumbled down the stairs.

Jasper walked in just as I lay on the ground in pain.

He dropped his jacket and rushed over to help me up.

"Lydia, what's wrong?"

Curling up in Jasper's arms, I pointed at Keira on the stairs, struggling to speak:

"She... she pushed me down."

Jasper's gaze turned icy cold.

Keira hurried down, kneeling to grab Jasper's hand.

"Jasper, believe me, why would I hurt her? She just wanted to fake weakness and fall down, like her mom used to do."

Jasper's grip on me loosened.

"Yes, I can't forget how your mom pretended to slap herself and framed my mom."

"Later, my dad slapped my mom ten times in front of me."

His voice was as cold as ice, piercing my heart.

He shoved me away, watching me writhe in pain with cold eyes.

"You're just like your mom, with her tricks."

"Let's go, Keira. Let's eat out and not let some people ruin our mood."

My head buzzed, only seeing Jasper and Keira's hands entwined as they walked away.

"Jasper... don't leave me. I'll die..."

The pain in my bones was nothing compared to the sticky sensation below, which terrified me.

"The baby... my baby..."
"I later saw my dad slap my mom ten times right in front of me."

His voice was icy, cutting through me deeply. He shoved me aside, his eyes cold as he watched my anguish and fury.

"You've truly mastered your mom's tricks to perfection."

"Let's go, Keira. I'll take you out to eat. Don't let certain people ruin your mood."

My head spun, and all I saw was Jasper walking away, hand in hand with Keira.

"Jasper... don't leave me, I'll die..."

More than the pain in my bones, the growing discomfort below terrified me.

"The baby... my baby..."
