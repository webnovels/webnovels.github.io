"Mom, Karl, my application to study abroad was approved. I'm planning to go to Lovick."

In the quiet living room, Rosalie Selfridge's voice was soft, barely rippling the air like a drop of water falling into a still pond.

Across the couch, her mother, Marion Jones, lit up with joy. "So soon? When are you leaving?"

"In ten days," Rosalie replied.

Marion hadn't expected things to move so quickly. Her excitement was soon replaced by a tinge of reluctance. "Well, I'd better start packing for you. It's your first time traveling so far, and it's abroad, too. I can't help but worry.

"I've already contacted an old friend. Her son is also in Lovick. Just reach out to him if you run into trouble. Don't be shy about it. 

"Oh, and speaking of him, we've agreed for you two to get married when you were kids. See if you two get along. It's the best if you do. If not, at least you'll have a friend."

Rosalie nodded. "Okay, Mom."

Marion was surprised to hear that. "Rosie, you're okay with that? So, you and your boyfriend… finally broke up?"

Rosalie fell silent.

Her stepfather, Karl Davies, seemed to catch on instantly. His palm smacked the table with a loud thud. "He wouldn't even come back to meet us! That alone shows he wasn't serious about you. Good riddance!"

"Boyfriend? What boyfriend?" A low voice shattered the heavy air in the room.

The three of them turned toward the source of the sound and saw Rosalie's stepbrother, Luke Davies, walking in.

Dressed in a black shirt and tailored pants, he carried himself with effortless grace. His tall, lean figure exuded a cool detachment, and every movement seemed to embody a relaxed confidence.

Rosalie stiffened slightly. She rose to her feet. "Luke."

Luke hummed in acknowledgement and tossed his car keys onto the table before heading upstairs.

…

That evening, Marion prepared an extravagant dinner and even opened a bottle of red wine.

She raised her glass and beamed at her family, ready to share the good news. "Alright, everyone. Let's celebrate! Here's to Rosie's—"

Sensing what was off, Rosalie quickly interrupted, "Mom, this wine tastes off. Could it have expired?"

"Expired?" Marion blinked, surprised. It shouldn't have. But before she could protest, Rosalie had already grabbed her arm under the pretense of getting a new one to steer her into the kitchen.

"Mom, don't tell Luke about me leaving."

At first, Marion found the request odd. But then, she remembered how much Luke doted on Rosalie. The thought of their close bond tugged at her heartstrings, so she nodded in agreement.

After eating a few bites, Rosalie excused herself and retreated to her room.

She washed up and lay in bed, her exhaustion pulling her into sleep.

But at midnight, her peace ended as someone slipped into bed beside her.

Warm breath grazed her neck. The next second, soft lips pressed against her skin, nibbling lightly. The cool, teasing sensation jolted Rosalie awake.

Her body tensed, and she instinctively pushed him away. "Luke!" she hissed, her voice sharp with alarm.

"What's wrong? Your mom wants to set you up with someone else, and now I'm off-limits?" In the dark of the night, Luke curled his lips into a smile, though it didn't reach his eyes. He lazily teased, "You've been with me for years, Rosalie. Think you can just walk away?"

Rosalie knew he had misunderstood but didn't bother to explain.

The silence stretched, and Luke's expression hardened.

He pulled her into his arms. "Rosalie, have I not made myself clear? You're not allowed to date anyone else. You're mine. Always."

Feeling the heat radiating from his body, Rosalie didn't want to escalate things. She blurted out, "It's… my time of the month. I'm not feeling well."

When Luke heard her explanation, his expression softened, but he couldn't help furrowing his brows. "Didn't it just end? Whatever. Fine. I won't touch you tonight. Go to sleep."

With that, he tightened his hold, keeping her firmly in his embrace.

As his steady breathing filled the room, Rosalie lay wide awake.

No one knew that her boyfriend was, in fact, Luke—her stepbrother.

She was 12 years old when Marion married Karl. With that, she became stepsister to Luke, the only child of the Davies family.

By the age of 14, they had grown so close that they seemed like real siblings. To the outside world, they were the perfect example of sibling harmony.

By 18 years old, Luke had discovered her secret diary filled with his name. Lounging lazily at her desk, he read through every word with a faint smirk. When Rosalie tried to snatch it back, he caught her hand and planted a kiss on her flushed cheek.

When Rosalie turned 20 years old, they crossed the line. It started with curiosity but soon turned into an unstoppable addiction.

By day, they were siblings. By night, they were entangled in secrets no one could ever know.

For Rosalie, loving Luke was her one rebellion in an otherwise well-behaved life. She was so in love with him that she convinced herself she didn't need recognition or approval. Someday, they could elope and marry in secret.

But all those fantasies came crashing down two weeks ago when she overheard his conversation with his friends.

It was raining that day, so she brought Luke an umbrella. Just as she reached the door to the private room, she overheard his friends.

"Luke, what are you going to do with your stepsister? Didn't you say you'd ditch her after you had enough fun? Why are you still with her?"

"Yeah. You were only with her to get back at her mom for marrying your dad. Don't tell me you're getting attached."

Revenge?

He dated her not because he liked her, but for revenge!

Rosalie's face was drained of color. Her mind buzzed, and her whole body began to tremble uncontrollably. Yet, she stubbornly stayed, desperate to hear Luke's response.

Then, came his voice, cold and cutting, like a blade slicing through her illusions, "She'll suffer more if I play along a bit longer."

Laughter erupted inside the room, but outside, Rosalie stood paralyzed.

So, he didn't like her. Being with her, calling her his girlfriend, and spending night after night together were all just revenge for Marion taking the place of his mother, Irene Leverton.

Marion still had to live in the Davies residence. Rosalie couldn't afford to let this truth ruin everything.

So, she made up her mind. She'd leave quietly—leave this house and leave him. That was why she applied to study abroad.

Now, she had only ten days left before she disappeared from his life.

Staring at the countdown on her phone, Rosalie gently pried Luke's arm from her waist.

But he instinctively pulled her back after a few minutes. She tried again, and once more, he clung to her.

The back-and-forth wore her patience thin. In the end, she grabbed a pillow and wedged it between them.

This time, he finally stopped. Rosalie could finally have some peace.

She knew their relationship was nearing its end. Soon, she'd no longer belong to him, and he'd no longer have the right to claim her.
