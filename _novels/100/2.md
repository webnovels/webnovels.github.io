Half an hour later, Sophia was led back in by Derek, holding his hand.

She walked with a limp, and there were obvious signs of tearing on the stockings on her inner thighs.

Everyone looked at me with schadenfreude, waiting for me to make a scene.

Because in the past, I would have inevitably cried my heart out in this situation, drawing attention to myself.

Derek pulled Sophia behind him protectively, his expression seeming to anticipate the drama as well.

However, several minutes passed, and I remained calm, slowly swirling the drink in my hand.

Derek was a bit surprised. After a moment, he let out a cold laugh:

"Well, well, looks like you've grown up and aren't making a fuss like before!"

I couldn't be bothered to watch him make a fool of himself, so I picked up my bag to leave, but he grabbed me:

"You've been drinking, it's late. Don't go wandering around alone - I can't have you getting picked up by some stranger and embarrassing me!"

Since someone was offering to take me home, I naturally didn't refuse.

When I tried to walk towards the back seat, Derek quickly blocked the front passenger door.

"Sit in the back."

He then helped Sophia into the front passenger seat.

"Derek is worried I'll get carsick. You won't be petty about this, will you, sis?" Sophia's tone was apologetic, but her expression was smug as she looked at me.

I sat quietly in the back seat, not saying a word.

Thinking I was so weak, she became even more unbridled.

Taking advantage of the traffic jam ahead, Sophia took off her shoes and propped her long, slender legs up on the steering wheel.

"My legs hurt so much. Derek, your hands are so big and strong. Sophia loves it when you massage my legs."

Seeing the beautiful feet in front of him, Derek froze, his breathing becoming heavy.

The next second, Derek suddenly looked back at the rear seat, as if just remembering I was in the car too.

"Don't hold back on my account. We're all going to be family soon, no need to be shy around me."

Seeing me looking out at the night scenery nonchalantly, his expression faltered, and he gently put Sophia's feet down.

The car pulled up in front of my building first. After I got out and headed straight upstairs, Derek chased after me.

He pulled out a diamond ring and handed it to me:

"You're still my fiancée in name, so consider this ring a compensation from me."

Seeing that I didn't take it, Derek took a deep breath and continued trying to persuade me.

"That's enough, you've embarrassed me so much tonight. How am I supposed to face others in the future?"

"As long as you don't make trouble, I'll make sure you keep your position as Mrs. Starr securely. There will be plenty of benefits for you in the future."

I took the ring and tried it on, finding it a size too big. I looked up and asked:

"So who's the real Mrs. Starr you're going to have children with? Sophia, right?"

Derek suddenly became angry, but his expression also held a hint of smug satisfaction.

"So you knew all along. I'm warning you, you absolutely cannot breathe a word of this to our parents!"

"Sophia and I are meant to be together! She's pure and kind, not scheming like you. If you dare to make her cry again like tonight, be careful or you'll end up with nothing!"

I laughed. He was clearly the one who was cowardly and afraid to tell his family his true wishes, yet somehow I had become the schemer standing in the way.

I ignored him and turned to go upstairs.

Just as I was about to go to sleep after showering, I received a video from Sophia.

In the video, Derek was lovingly and carefully helping her put on an even larger diamond ring.

"This one suits my beloved Sophia much better. That outdated piece of junk from earlier - I threw it away."

When things got heated, the two of them fell onto the bed in a tight embrace. The screen went black, but unmistakable sounds could still be heard.

At the end, Sophia sent me a string of text messages like a victor:

[Be content, sister. Even though you're getting my leftovers, not many people can compare to this life of luxury.]

[For the rest of your life, just keep playing your role well. We won't mistreat you.]
