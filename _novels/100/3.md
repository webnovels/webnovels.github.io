So Sophia had been reborn too.

No wonder in my past life, she and Derek had no apparent connection on the surface, yet they had secretly been carrying on behind the scenes.

I suppose they had already confessed their feelings to each other and were looking to rekindle their relationship in this life.

I lowered my eyes, remembering how after I married into the Starr family in my past life, Starr Industries suddenly took off, not only securing endless contracts but also going public on NASDAQ.

The Starr family elders all praised me for bringing good fortune to my husband, and treated me like their own daughter.

So even though Derek and I never had children of our own, I always thought I was happy, until I later discovered the truth.

My mother called to tell me that Harrison Moon was about to return to the country.

I was a bit surprised, because in my past life, Derek's uncle, who was only ten years older than him, never married.

I hadn't expected our arranged marriage to progress so smoothly.

I only vaguely remembered him as a stern elder who rarely smiled. When I was little, every time Derek bullied me to tears, he would patiently hand me tissues. Then a few days later, Derek would sport bruises and be on his best behavior towards me for a while.

I had thought our relationship was simply that of an elder and a junior, nothing more.

Until in my past life, after I accidentally discovered Sophia and Derek's family of three and died from falling into water in shock.

At my funeral, I saw Harrison Moon with bloodshot eyes, pinning Derek to the ground and beating him over and over again.

Only then did I realize that his feelings for me had unknowingly sprouted long ago.

The next day, I arrived early at my clothing workshop in the company to modify the design of my wedding dress.

Ever since I started studying fashion design in college, I had been working on designing my wedding dress.

Except back then, the person I wanted to marry with all my heart was Derek.

From the style to the accessories, everything had to be according to his preferences, without any of my own ideas.

In this life, I could finally wear the wedding dress I truly wanted, to marry someone else.

I hadn't rested well for several days. After finishing the dress, I slept for a day and a night. When I woke up, I saw Sophia's social media post.

In the photo, my newly altered wedding dress had its skirt cut off, turned into a short dress worn on her body as she coquettishly posed in Derek's arms with her legs raised.

[Derek knew I was doing a photoshoot, so he specially brought this for me~ It feels so good to be loved!]

I rushed to the photo studio in disbelief.

Sophia and Derek were resting, while my wedding dress was crumpled into a ball and tossed on the ground like garbage.

"How dare you touch my wedding dress and deliberately ruin it!"

Seeing me, Sophia immediately put on an act of being scared and started crying.

"Derek... Did I make my sister angry? Why does she look like she wants to hit me?"

Derek pulled her behind him protectively. "Lily Frost, it's just a dress! You were going to wear it for me to see anyway, so what's wrong with letting Sophia wear it for a photoshoot?!"

"Besides, I don't even like this style. You might as well make a new one! Don't make such a big deal out of nothing!"

I could hardly believe his shamelessness. "Stop being so full of yourself! This is the wedding dress I made for myself!"

Derek shook his head and sneered, "That's enough, Lily Frost. Isn't our wedding basically our wedding? I've already agreed to marry you, don't push your luck here!"

I grabbed the Zippo lighter from the coffee table and flicked it open. Sophia thought I was going to burn her alive and hid behind Derek in terror, her face pale with fright.

"Derek Starr, open your eyes wide and watch carefully! I won't keep anything that's been dirtied! And I certainly won't stoop so low as to marry a man who has hurt me countless times!"

I picked up the ruined wedding dress, set it on fire, and tossed it into the air before turning to leave.

Seeing my resolute attitude, Derek was caught off guard.

In the past, no matter how much I cried and made a fuss, I would always give in first. He had never seen me act like this before.

He instinctively wanted to stop me, but Sophia's exaggerated, affected voice rang out at the wrong moment.

"Sophia is so scared, my heart is racing... But it's okay, Derek, don't worry about me. It's all my fault, you should go after my sister..."

Derek hesitated for a moment, then looked at my retreating figure and snorted coldly:

"Who are you trying to impress?! Lily Frost, you said it yourself - even if you strip naked and kneel on the ground begging me later, I won't marry you!"
