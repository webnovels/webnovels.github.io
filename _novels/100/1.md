On the day we set the wedding date, I ran into Derek at a bar.

His friends saw me suddenly appear and their faces were full of disdain and mockery:

"Oh look, Young Master Starr, your little crybaby stalker has followed you here!"

"Mrs. Starr-to-be, the news of your engagement to the Starr family is all over social media. Why are you still keeping such a close eye on him? We're throwing one last bachelor party for Derek here - are you trying to ruin it?"

When Derek looked up and saw it was me, he angrily downed his drink in one gulp.

"Lily Frost, are you really that desperate to throw yourself at me? You sent over the dowry without my consent, and now the whole world knows you're about to become Mrs. Starr. You're quite the schemer, aren't you?"

His look of disgust made my heart skip a beat. After a moment, I calmly replied:

"The person I'm marrying isn't you, so why would I need your consent?"

As soon as I said this, the whole place erupted in laughter.

Derek's buddies were laughing so hard they had tears in their eyes. They urged him:

"Derek, you'd better comfort your little wife here, or she might start crying and making a scene to get sympathy again!"

Derek frowned: "Where did you learn to play hard to get? Let me tell you, Lily Frost, that trick won't work on me."

"You've set the wedding date with my family, who else could you possibly be marrying if not me? My father?"

"Besides, you've been following me around like a lovesick puppy since elementary school. Who would believe you're marrying someone else?"

He walked over and stroked my messy hair in a seemingly affectionate gesture, but his grip was painfully tight.

"I'll let the unauthorized engagement slide, but listen carefully - I can go through with a wedding ceremony for show... but don't even think about me touching you!"

He leaned in close to my ear and lowered his voice:

"If you don't want to live as a lonely wife, you'd better wise up and get lost. I'll only have children with someone I truly love!"

Hearing this, I frowned slightly. In my past life, Derek had indeed obediently followed his family's arrangements and quickly married me.

Could it be... that he had been reborn too?

Before I could further analyze the information hidden in his words, my sister Sophia suddenly appeared at the door.

Seeing Derek's intimate behavior next to me, Sophia's eyes suddenly welled up with tears as she covered her mouth.

"Derek, I heard you're going to marry my sister. Even though we'll be family soon, I didn't bring any gifts. I just wish you eternal happiness!"

With that, Sophia ran out crying as if escaping for her life.

"Lily Frost, are you fucking satisfied now?" Derek pointed at me, fuming with anger, then stormed out without looking back.
