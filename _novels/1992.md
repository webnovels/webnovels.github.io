My boyfriend was taking me to his trust-fund crowd’s party for the very first time.
The moment his female friend—one of the few girls in his inner circle—saw me, she rushed over, threw her arms around me, and practically yelled.
“Oh my god, Babe! You are stunning! Seriously, look at her—so graceful and totally polished!”
“No wonder Brody likes you! I might even develop a crush myself!”
She then covered her mouth in mock surprise, leaning in conspiratorially.
“Did you, like, go to one of those Socialite Coaching classes? I’m just too much of a mess—one of the guys—I could never learn all that stuff.”
“I heard those places only teach gold diggers how to hook a whale. But wow, it clearly works! Did they really teach you how to snag Brody?”
“Seriously, you’re so good! Must have cost a fortune, right?”
The private lounge instantly erupted. Brody’s cronies started to whoop and cheer.
“I knew she looked mass-produced! Brody, you gotta be careful, man, don’t get played!”
“Yeah, these professional catches are getting better and better. Even we almost missed it.”
Brody looked vaguely embarrassed but still defended Piper Connelly.
“Tatum, Piper’s just blunt, man. She’s just a tomboy, no filter. It’s a joke, so don’t give me that sour face and ruin the vibe.”
I didn't get angry. Instead, I simply nodded.
I had, in fact, been to that class. But my identity was far from what she assumed.
Since she’d decided to air it out in public, she shouldn't blame me for not holding back.

It was Saturday night, and Brody Graham was taking me to his usual crew's gathering for the first time.
The moment we pushed open the door to the velvet-draped private room, a woman in a tiny silk slip dress and hot pants surged forward.
“Brody! You’re finally here! Three shots, right now!”
She completely ignored me, hanging right off Brody’s neck.
“Pip, cut it out. My girlfriend’s here,” Brody said, chuckling as he gently pushed her away.
Piper Connelly finally looked at me, as if she were just noticing I existed, peering out from Brody’s shoulder.
“Oh, there’s the girlfriend! My bad, Babe. Brody and I are like brothers, we have no boundaries. Don’t mind me.”
She apologized with her mouth, but her body was still pressed against Brody’s arm, and her eyes held a distinct challenge.
I smoothed the fabric of my dress, my expression neutral. “Since you know you have no boundaries, just try to keep it in check next time.”
The air in the VIP room froze for a single beat.
Piper’s practiced smile wavered, then she finally stepped away from Brody and circled me slowly.
“Wow! Seriously, look at you! That posture, that subtle smile... you are so graceful and polished!”
She clapped her hands dramatically, drawing the attention of the surrounding trust-funders.
“No wonder Brody’s obsessed! That whole... vibe... ugh, I could never pull it off.”
Piper covered her mouth, feigning innocence, and leaned closer.
“Babe, did you, like, go to one of those high-end Socialite Coaching classes? I’m just one of the guys—a total mess—all that effort just looks exhausting.”
I met her eyes coldly. “What exactly are you trying to say?”
Piper let out a peal of artificial laughter.
“Don’t get mad, I’m just curious! I heard those places specifically teach financially motivated women how to hook rich guys—they even give you a standard way to smile and hold a champagne flute.”
“And wow, it clearly works! Did they really teach you how to snag Brody?”
She turned to the others, raising her voice.
“Guys, come look! This is what you call professional! Our new girl is good! Must’ve dropped major cash on the tuition, right?”
Someone choked on their drink. Then, the mocking chorus began.
“I knew she looked cookie-cutter. That chin—could cut glass.”
“Brody, wake up, man. These pro gold diggers package themselves so well, they almost had us fooled too.”
“Yeah, a total assembly line socialite. Spent her life savings to land a whale.”
All their malicious gazes focused on me.
Brody, clearly uncomfortable, tugged at Piper’s sleeve. “Alright, Pip, that’s enough.”
“Why, Brody? I’m just vetting her for you!” Piper pulled her arm away, her face a picture of injured loyalty.
“I’m afraid you’re getting played! Women who come out of those classes are all about strategy. Only someone like me, who genuinely treats you like a brother, would tell you the truth.”
Brody glanced at the smirking faces around the room and lost his temper.
“Tatum, don’t be so sensitive. Piper’s just blunt, man. She’s just a tomboy, no filter. It was a joke.”
“A joke?” I gave a chilling laugh. “First time meeting me, and you’re spreading rumors that I’m a professional scammer. That’s your ‘no filter’?”
Brody’s face darkened.
“Are you done? Maybe I shouldn’t have brought you! Piper said she didn’t mean anything by it. Do you have to be so dramatic?”
“Exactly, Babe.” Piper threw up her hands, looking innocent.
“I’m just clumsy with words, I can’t hide a thing. If you don’t have anything to hide, why are you reacting so strongly? Did I hit a nerve?”
As she spoke, she grabbed a bottle of red wine and two elegant glasses from the table.
“Oh well, since I made you mad, I guess I’ll fine myself a drink.”
She poured one glass full to the brim, but instead of drinking it, she held the other one out to me.
“But seriously, since you’re a star student from the Finishing School, can you show me? How do you hold the glass to look truly high-class? Do I curl my pinky? Maybe a perfect forty-five-degree smile?”
The room dissolved into another burst of laughter.
“Show us! Come on, Babe, teach us!”
“Let us see what tens of thousands of dollars in tuition gets you!”
Brody stood aside, lighting a cigarette, making no move to stop her. He was watching me with a trace of suspicion, clearly second-guessing my identity.
I ignored the glass. I just looked at Piper, my voice low and dangerous. “I suggest you stop now.”
“Ooh, is the new girl looking down on me?” Piper taunted, her voice dripping with sarcasm.
“Right. I’m just street trash. Not worthy of your high-end, professionally packaged goods.”
She suddenly pulled out her phone and shoved the camera directly into my face.
“Come on, come on! Since you won’t teach me, I’ll just film a quick clip and send it to the group chat. Let everyone decide!”
“Smile, Babe! Don’t look so stiff! Give us that special look you used to hook Brody!”

Snap!
I raised my hand and blocked the phone she was shoving into my face.
It was a light push, but the phone clattered onto the thick rug with a dull thud.
“Ah! My phone!” Piper shrieked, then spun on Brody.
“Brody, look at her! It was just a joke, and she threw my phone! That was the anniversary gift you bought me!”
Brody ground out his cigarette, his brow furrowed.
“Tatum, that was excessive. It’s just a phone. Did you have to get physical?”
“She was filming me without my permission and shoving the camera in my face. Should I not block it?” I countered flatly.
“You still shouldn’t break things!” Brody snapped, impatience flooding his face. “Piper just likes to play around. You’re older—can’t you just let it go?”
“Okay, okay, everyone cool down.” Chase, a guy with bleached-blond hair, jumped in, a smirk in his eyes. “Our girl’s got a temper. Did that finishing school teach self-defense too?”
Piper rubbed her wrist, her eyes darting from me to Brody, then back. Suddenly, she switched to a sweet smile.
“Okay, my bad too. As an apology, I’ll drink this glass as a toast to you.”
She raised the wine glass to me, but her wrist tilted at a strange angle. “Oops, slippery floor!”
Splash!
The full glass of red wine was perfectly aimed, soaking the front of my white silk slip dress.
“Oh my God! I’m so sorry!”
Piper’s mouth apologized, but her eyes were full of triumphant glee. She reached out, pretending to dab at my wet chest, but pressing hard.
“Oh no, Babe. Did you rent this dress? You’re going to have to pay a ton! Gotta call the Sugar Daddy for a reimbursement, quick!”
The room exploded with harsh, mocking laughter.
That was it. I couldn't hold it in any longer.
I violently slapped her hand away. “Get off me!”
My shove wasn't powerful, but Piper reacted as if she’d been hit by a wrecking ball. She flew backward, hitting the corner of the low coffee table with a thud before collapsing onto the floor.
“Aah!! My stomach! It hurts!”
She curled up, her face paper-white. “Babe... even if you were mad, you shouldn’t have pushed me...”
“Piper!” Brody’s face changed instantly. He rushed over to help her up, then turned his bloodshot eyes on me.
“Tatum! Are you insane? You know Piper has health issues! How dare you push her!”
“I didn't push her, she fell.”
“I saw it with my own eyes, and you’re still lying!” Brody stood up and shoved me hard.
I stumbled back, hitting the wall. A sharp pain shot up my spine.
“Tatum, I can’t believe how twisted you are!” Brody pointed a finger at me. “If anything happens to Piper, I’m done with you!”
“Brody... don’t blame her...” Piper weakly pulled his hand. “I just lost my footing... don’t fight with her because of me...”
Brody held her tight, his expression full of protective tenderness, and looked at me as if I were the enemy.
“See? Piper is still defending you! And you? Not even an apology? What kind of heartless piece of trash did that finishing school turn you into?”
Nestled in his arms, Piper secretly gave me a small, victorious smile and raised the phone she still had clutched in her hand.
“Babe, I accidentally recorded you pushing me just now.”
She leaned in close, whispering so only I could hear.
“A violent attacker being exposed online? Your perfect socialite persona is going to crash and burn. I wonder what man will still want you after this.”

“What are you going to do?”
I stared at the phone in Piper’s hand, a cold certainty rising in my chest.
Piper ignored me, her fingers flying across the screen—the interface of a video editing app.
Less than two minutes later, several phones belonging to the guys in the room beeped simultaneously with a notification.
“Holy hell! That title is spicy!” Chase yelled first.
“Shocking! Trust-Fund Boyfriend Brings Home Socialite-School Girlfriend, Who Viciously Attacks His Childhood Friend When Exposed? Pip, your caption is genius!”
“I got it too!” another girl squealed, holding up her phone. “It’s trending on the local feed! The comment section is already a war zone!”
Piper leaned back in Brody’s arms, weakly waving her phone.
“I didn’t want to do this, Babe. But I can’t just let you assault me, right? The internet needs to judge.”
I pulled out my own phone. The video had already been shared thousands of times.
It was clearly maliciously edited, showing only my cold glare, my hand swatting her away, and the shots of her dramatically screaming and clutching her stomach on the floor.
Her splashing me with wine and her verbal abuse? Gone. Cleaned up.
The accompanying text was vile:
[Giving my big brother’s girlfriend a friendly warning—and this is what happens. These professionally trained gold diggers are terrifying. Avoid at all costs, family!]
The comments were immediately disgusting:
“She looks like a prostitute. That plastic surgery is dripping off her face.”
“Assault? This manipulative bitch needs to be thrown off the planet!”
“Find out who she is! Doxx her!”
I shoved my screen in front of Brody. “Malicious editing, encouraging online harassment. That’s your ‘no filter’ friend?”
Brody glanced at the screen full of venomous comments, his face turning an unhealthy shade of crimson.
But he didn't yell at Piper. He yelled at me.
“Tatum! You have the nerve to complain?”
Brody snatched my phone and threw it down.
“If you hadn’t gotten physical first, would Piper have posted the video? Now look! The whole internet is attacking us—and I’m being doxxed! You’ve completely humiliated me!”
“Apologize to Piper, right now! Film a video clarifying that you just had a breakdown, and stop dragging my name through the mud!”
“I will not apologize,” I said, my gaze locked on Brody. “I am not the one in the wrong.”
“You won’t apologize, huh?”
Piper suddenly sat up in Brody’s lap, a malicious glint in her eyes. “Then don’t blame me for taking things to the next level.”
She tapped the live-stream button on the social media app.
“Good evening, everyone. I’m the person in that viral video...”
Piper faced the camera, her eyes instantly filling with tears, her voice perfectly choked with sobs.
“I’m still here in the VIP room. My stomach hurts so badly... and the woman who attacked me is still here. She won’t apologize and said I deserved it...”
The live stream audience instantly soared from a few hundred to tens of thousands. The comments were a dense torrent of insults aimed at me.
[Bitch! Still there?]
[Show us her face! We want to see what this piece of trash looks like!]
[Don’t worry, Pip! We have your back!]
Piper abruptly swiveled the camera to face me.
“It’s her.”
In that moment, I felt as if I were naked, exposed to tens of thousands of strangers. The comments were flashing too fast to read, but the keywords were clear: Die, Slut, Get on your knees.
The rich kids in the room excitedly gathered around, staring at me like a circus act.
Chase even leaned into the camera to egg the audience on. “Guys, she was about to attack Brody too! She’s totally out of control!”
“Tatum, I’m saying this one last time.” Brody stood just outside the camera’s frame, his voice firm.
“You see the public outrage. If you get on your knees right now and apologize to Piper, admit you were jealous, this whole thing goes away. If not, don’t expect any more loyalty from me.”
Piper held the phone, a winner's smirk on her lips, and mouthed two words silently at me:
Kneel down.
I looked at the ring of sneering, monstrous faces, and suddenly, I felt a strange amusement.
They thought this was my downfall.
They didn’t know this was the stage I had been waiting for.
I took a deep breath, faced the live camera, and instead of kneeling, I calmly adjusted the collar of my wine-stained dress.
Then, I looked straight into Piper’s eyes and took a step toward her.
“You want me to kneel?”
I smiled—the first genuine smile I’d shown all night—directly into the lens.
“Fine. Let these hundreds of thousands of viewers watch closely. Let’s see who is the one who truly deserves to be on their knees.”

“What are you doing? Are you going to hit me on a live stream?”
Piper instinctively shrank back behind Brody, holding the phone higher.
“Look, everyone! She’s acting out again! This violent psychopath is dangerous!”
The comments exploded:
[Call the cops! Arrest her!]
[Too aggressive! Doxx her!]
Brody lunged in front of me, grabbing my wrist fiercely.
“Tatum! Don’t push your luck! If you don’t apologize now, we’re breaking up! And you won't be walking out of this door alone!”
“Break up?”
I yanked my hand free. “Brody, you’re jumping the gun. In a minute, I think you’ll be begging me not to leave.”
“Are you crazy?” Chase mocked from the side. “Brody beg you? Who do you think you are? The Finishing School’s valedictorian?”
The room erupted into another wave of snickers.
I ignored the clowns and walked straight up to Piper.
“Is this your big play? Live stream, fake tears, and inciting harassment?”
I gestured to her phone screen. The viewer count had just crossed 100,000.
Piper thought I was terrified. She proudly puffed out her chest.
“Scared? Then get on your knees! Just admit you were jealous, admit you’re a fraud, and I’ll tell the family to back off.”
“Alright. Since we have such a large audience, let’s get everything straight.”
I suddenly turned, facing the live camera. “Good evening, everyone.”
My voice was clear and commanding, cutting through the noise in the room.
“Regarding this ‘Socialite Coaching class’ that Ms. Connelly mentioned... I did, in fact, attend it.”
At that admission, the live stream comments went wild:
[She admitted it! Told you she was trash!]
[Confirmed! No shame!]
Piper was so excited she almost jumped out of Brody’s arms.
“Hear that, everyone! She admitted it! These women who literally pay to learn how to manipulate men are a cancer on society!”
“However...”
I paused, then raised my voice, a sharp change in pitch.
“I attended as the Chief Investigative Reporter for Channel 5 News, going undercover for a segment on financial fraud and exploitation.”
The VIP room went instantly silent.
The triumphant smile hadn't even had time to leave Piper’s face before it froze in place.
“R-re-reporter?” Chase stammered, finally breaking the heavy silence.
I didn't give them a moment to process. My gaze was a surgeon's scalpel, cutting straight into Piper Connelly.
“Piper Connelly, or perhaps I should use your alias from the Institute... ‘Sunny Day’?”
Piper’s face went instantly white. She instinctively tried to shut off the live stream.
But I was ready. I grabbed her wrist, forcing the phone’s camera to point at both of us.
“What’s wrong? You don’t want the ‘family’ to see the real you?”
I leaned in close, speaking slowly, deliberately.
“If I recall correctly, you were the star pupil who got expelled for stealing a fake designer bag from your roommate—and had to take out thirty thousand in high-interest loans for your plastic surgery. That was you, wasn’t it?”
