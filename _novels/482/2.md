The man on the other end sighed, his voice icy. "Little sis, I'm glad you've come to your senses. Your second brother will be thrilled to hear this."

After hanging up, I lay on the cold floor sleepless all night. My phone buzzed once, shattering what was left of my frozen heart.

A video from Lily.

With trembling hands, I pressed play. By the end, my whole body was rigid with shock.

"Big sis, did you sleep well last night? I arranged for the baby in your belly to come thank me. I specially chose quality DNA, no need to thank me."

I sat paralyzed, chilled to the bone. Lily had switched out the casino staff...

In the final shot, I saw someone injecting something into my body.

I rushed to the bathroom and vomited until I was spitting up blood. I scrubbed my skin raw with steel wool, tears and blood mixing together.

In my past life, although Lily was adopted, she had behaved herself in the Shen household.

But this time, it was like she had become a completely different person.

A horrifying thought popped into my head - they had all been reborn.

I dragged my battered body to the hospital in a panic, begging the nurse, "Please give me an abortion, I'm begging you."

Just as I finished speaking, the clack of high heels sounded behind me. I looked up to see Aiden striding over, his face dark with anger.

"Big sis, you're pregnant? But why are you asking the nurse for an abortion? Don't you want Aiden's baby?" Lily's voice dripped with false concern.

I rushed over and clutched Aiden's hand tightly. "I'm not pregnant. This isn't my baby. Lily switched out the casino staff and had them put... into me."

Aiden's eyes flashed red as he pinned me against the wall, gritting his teeth. "You're still trying to frame Lily even now? I thought you had improved, but you're still as selfish as ever."

Even my father, who had rushed over at the commotion, slapped me hard across the face. "You ungrateful child! When will you learn to be as obedient as Lily? This is your own flesh and blood!"

Blood seeped from the corner of my mouth as I swallowed the metallic taste.

I watched them laugh uproariously, tears silently rolling down my cheeks.

The two men who had loved me most had handed me over to the casino without a second thought. They would rather believe an outsider than ask their own daughter what happened.

In my past life, I distinctly remembered them putting an entire medical team on standby at our mansion if I so much as coughed once.

Helpless tears spilled over as I could no longer hold them back.

Seeing me like this, Aiden's heart clenched. He took a step towards me.

But Lily began sobbing at that moment. "I've already forgiven big sis, why do you still want to frame me? I'm a victim too, I was almost..."

She trailed off at just the right moment, making Aiden shake with fury. Her eyes gleamed with triumph as she looked at me.

Rage boiled over and I glared at her venomously. I staggered to my feet and lunged at her.

But I had barely touched a strand of her hair when Aiden violently shoved me away. I crashed into a cart, shattering IV bottles everywhere. Pain radiated through my entire body.

As blood gushed from between my legs, I saw Aiden gently blowing on Lily's scalp.

While my normally composed father frantically called for doctors and nurses.

I smiled as I blacked out.

When I came to, I was tightly strapped to the hospital bed, unable to move an inch. My hands and feet were bound to the point of losing circulation.

The nurses' envious words drifted to my ears.

"When will I find a man like Mr. Aiden? His fiancée yanked out one of his adopted sister's hairs, and he called in the top hair transplant surgeon."

"I know right? He's treating her like a mental patient to prevent her from hurting Miss Lily again. I've never seen restraints used like this before!"

Their voices faded away. I looked up to see Aiden appear in the doorway. Was that a flash of pain in his eyes as he looked at me?

I let out a cold laugh.

He noticed my gaze and loosened the restraints, his Adam's apple bobbing.

"Chloe, you're being too unreasonable. Lily said you just got your period and weren't pregnant at all. Your methods of getting my attention are too clumsy."

My breathing hitched. He so easily believed everything Lily said.

"You should apologize to Lily. As compensation, give her your Four Seasons Villa. You don't use it anyway."
