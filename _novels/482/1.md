At the casino, my body trembled uncontrollably. In my past life, Aiden had been willing to drain his own blood to save me. But just three minutes ago, he had drugged his own blood and forced me to drink it.

He sighed regretfully, his warm fingertips brushing away my tears. "Chloe, I've replaced everyone at the casino with my own people. They won't hurt you. You just need to put on an act to soothe Lily's wounded feelings."

"You ruined one of her dresses yesterday. Consider this as making amends."

Even my doting father chimed in, "Think of it as character building. If it weren't for you, Lily wouldn't have run off to the casino heartbroken."

I was stunned speechless, my whole body shaking. I couldn't believe these words were coming from my formerly overprotective father.

Yesterday, Lily had seen my dress at the mall and lunged for it, but she slipped and tore her own clothes, embarrassing herself in public. She blamed me for "causing" her wardrobe malfunction to be photographed.

Heartbroken, she had run off to the casino and lost everything.

Compared to how these two men had doted on me in my past life, I felt my pupils constrict in shock. Could it be that they had been reborn as well?

My body was rigid but my mind razor sharp as tears streamed down my face.

Aiden positioned me in a pose that satisfied everyone, casino chips precariously balanced on my barely-clothed body.

"Aiden, isn't that Chloe, the crazy beauty from the Shen family? You're setting us up... Wouldn't your cousin be a better choice?" Several wealthy young men leered hungrily while nervously backing away, their clammy hands tentatively reaching for my body.

Aiden leaned back in his chair, his gaze fixed coldly on the changing room. "Since I brought her, feel free to enjoy. Her blood-nourished body gets wet at the slightest touch."

My whole body shook like a leaf. The Aiden I knew would fret for hours if a mosquito bite left a small bump on his carefully maintained body. Now he was handing me over to strangers without a second thought.

Seeing me helpless like a fish on a chopping block, the men rubbed their hands eagerly.

As they tore at what little clothing I had left, waves of humiliation washed over me. My heart shattered into a million pieces.

In the distance, Lily emerged from the changing room with reddened eyes. Aiden pulled her into his arms tenderly.

His doting tone made her giggle coquettishly. Those who had disrespected her earlier now kowtowed in apology. My emotions were a tangled mess.

I remembered how in the past, Aiden would viciously punish anyone who so much as looked at me wrong.

When Lily's gaze fell on me, her eyes flashed with vicious glee even as she feigned concern.

"Big sis, even if you're used to being arrogant, you shouldn't be naked in front of so many men. How embarrassing! You should all get closer to keep her warm."

As soon as she finished speaking, Aiden strode over and covered her eyes with his hand. "Don't look, it's dirty."

My fingernails dug into my palms as I trembled in pain, tears falling in big drops.

It was June, but Aiden clearly understood Lily's implications. He was indulging her, backing her up.

This germaphobe who had once held my blood-soaked body and kissed me tenderly - why was he being so ruthless this time?

Seeing Aiden leave, the men lost all restraint, crowding around the gambling table to play freely.

Satisfied, they tossed me aside. The laughter in the room drowned out my heart-wrenching screams.

Every breath was filled with the metallic taste of pain.

I stumbled home on shaky legs, but froze at the doorway, my breathing nearly stopping.

My clenched fists hung limply at my sides.

Lily and I shared the same birthday. At that moment, my father and Aiden were celebrating her birthday at the table, countless gifts piled in the living room.

Everything that should have been mine in my past life now had nothing to do with me.

The three of them laughed and chatted around the dinner table, a warm family scene I had desperately longed for in this life and the last.

It turned out Lily could obtain it so easily.

I averted my gaze and snuck up to the second floor through the back door. As soon as I closed the door, I could no longer hold back and broke down sobbing.

I had changed my personality for Aiden's sake, but why had he and my father acted so out of character?

This time, I wanted to love him properly, but he didn't even give me a chance.

Ashen-faced, I took out my phone.

"Big bro, I'm coming to find you guys. I won't marry him anymore."
