When I opened my eyes again, my body burned with pain. I wasn't in a hospital, but a dark basement with a cheap bed.

I touched my singed, messy hair, my heart shattering.

The housekeeper hugged me gently with reddened eyes.

"Miss, you're finally awake. You've suffered so much. How could Mr. Aiden do this to you? He knew what you went through..."

Tears silently rolled down my face. Yes, he used to personally drive me everywhere, knowing my fear. This time he had someone kidnap and race me around.

My prized hair was burned on a whim.

I let out a bitter laugh.

In my past life he had loved me to death. In this life he loved someone else to death. We were never meant to be together.

I had a long dream where my second brother took me away. All four of my brothers showered me with endless love. Just thinking about it made me smile.

Aiden's casually placed hands clenched into tight fists as he struggled to contain his anger.

"Consider this punishment a warning. Why do you have to keep going after Lily? She's not as lucky as you. Can't you just let her have this?"

I scoffed. As if Lily's misfortune was my fault.

Who should I blame for my current situation then?

I met his eyes, my own stinging with unshed tears.

"Aiden, have you really forgotten how much you loved me in our past life?"

He looked dazed for a moment before furrowing his brow and coldly replying,

"What nonsense are you spouting? You think we had a past life together?"

He stormed off before I could respond.

I laughed bitterly as I gathered my things, burning all the wedding supplies before heading to the airport.

But as soon as I stepped out the front door, blinding headlights shone on me as a car sped straight at me.

BANG!

When I came to, Lily and I were tied to chairs. Her face was twisted with malice as she looked at me.

"I know you want to leave. As it happens, I know a place where Aiden will never find you."

As she finished speaking, the men from the casino walked towards us. I stared at her in wide-eyed horror.

But they walked right past me and went straight for Lily. The next moment, her screams echoed through the warehouse.

"Even if you ruin me, Aiden still won't like you! Please let me go!"

Before I could process what was happening, the door was kicked open violently.

Aiden strode in backlit dramatically. A small doll covered in needles hit me in the face, drawing blood.

I shook my head frantically, face pale. "It wasn't me..."

But his handsome face was contorted with rage, his eyes like he was looking at a dead person.

"We found your fingerprints in Lily's car. What else do you have to say? Chloe, you're still as disgusting as before!"

I stared blankly as he carried Lily away. Every breath tasted of blood.

Aiden, goodbye and good riddance.

As the casino men swarmed towards me, I closed my eyes in despair with a bitter smile.
