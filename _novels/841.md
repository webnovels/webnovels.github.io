Minerva Sowle said, "Mr. Davison, Mrs. Davison, I've thought this through. I'm ready to become part of the Davison family."

Minerva drew a steady breath and finally voiced the decision she had wrestled with for a long time.

Algernon Davison and Maxine Ford froze for a moment. They quickly set down their afternoon tea, reaching out to take her hands, their faces filled with joy.

"That's wonderful, Minerva! Algernon and I have always wanted a daughter as sweet and thoughtful as you. Our wish has finally come true. 

"We'll get the paperwork started right away. Your name will be on the Davison family record in no time," Maxine said warmly.

"It won't take long. In just two weeks, everything will be official. We'll truly be a family then," Algernon added.

As the two of them excitedly began making arrangements, Minerva quickly stopped them.

"Wait, there's one more thing. My application for the study abroad program has been approved. I'll be leaving the country soon to continue my studies," she said gently.

Algernon's and Maxine's smiles faltered. 

Maxine quickly said, "So suddenly? We were hoping to host a celebration and make an official announcement…"

Minerva understood their feelings, so she reassured them with a gentle smile. "Pursuing my studies abroad has always been my dream. And since we'll be family soon, it'll be easy to stay in touch. Flight tickets are simple to purchase, and we'll still have each other, no matter where I am in the world."

The older couple exchanged a glance, then sighed while nodding.

"That makes sense," Algernon said. "Alright. When are you leaving?"

Minerva smiled faintly. "The day the paperwork is finalized—when you officially become my parents, and Frederick becomes my brother."

Maxine immediately replied, "Then, you should move in with us before that. We'll send someone to help pack your things."

Seeing their eagerness and warmth, Minerva didn't refuse. She nodded lightly in response.

After arranging for someone to help her move, Algernon and Maxine seemed to remember something suddenly. 

Maxine hesitated, then asked, "About adding you to the family record… should we be the ones to tell Frederick, or would you rather do it yourself?"

Minerva stiffened slightly.

Before she could answer, her phone buzzed with a new message. "Eleganza Hotel. Bring ten boxes of condoms."

It was from Frederick.

Minerva felt her heart tighten. After a long pause, she spoke, her voice slightly hoarse.

"I'll tell him myself."

…

After leaving the Davison residence, Minerva hailed a cab.

She stared out the window as the city rushed past. Her thoughts were scattered in a tangled mess. 

Life was truly unpredictable.

No one could have predicted that the man she loved would soon become her brother. She certainly hadn't expected this to happen.

The Davison and Sowle families had always been close. She and Frederick Davison had grown up side by side. They later became childhood sweethearts who seemed inseparable.

Everyone around them knew she was his, and no one ever dared to get too close.

At age seven, Minerva's delicate features drew the attention of every boy in class, all eager to sit beside her. 

Frederick fought off every boy who tried, then claimed the seat beside her as if it naturally belonged to him. Even back then, his possessiveness was hard to miss.

At age 14, when Minerva's parents died in a tragic car crash, Frederick abandoned a regional tournament to rush back from another state. He stayed by her side all night, eyes rimmed red with unshed tears, aching for her in silence. He promised he would never leave her.

At age 16, Minerva knitted him a scarf. He wore it constantly—from winter straight through to summer—and even made her promise never to make one for anyone else.

At age 18, Frederick took her to a tattoo parlor and had his name inked on her chest—just above her heart. He told her she would always belong to him.

The pair had crossed every boundary without there ever being a formal confession. Everyone, including Algernon and Maxine, thought they were destined to end up together.

But one day, Frederick suddenly brought home a plain, quiet girl no one had ever seen before—and introduced her to everyone as the only woman he would ever love.

Algernon and Maxine were stunned. They stood up for Minerva, openly voicing their disapproval.

But Frederick didn't care. He defied his parents, endured their punishments, and even gave up his place as heir to the Davison family—all just to be with Yolanda Wolfe.

No one ever understood what had changed in him.

When Algernon and Maxine realized they couldn't make Minerva their daughter-in-law, they chose to make her their daughter instead. They loved her too much to let her go.

At first, Minerva had hoped Frederick would come to his senses and return to his normal self.

But day after day, she watched him treat Yolanda like she was the center of his world—every word gentle, every look indulgent. Eventually, Minerva's heart gave up. Whatever hope she had clung to finally died in her chest.

From that moment on, she would only ever be his sister.

There would be no future for Minerva and Frederick.

After getting out of the cab, Minerva walked into Eleganza Hotel and made her way to the room Frederick had texted her about.

The door was left slightly ajar. Inside, she could hear his voice—familiar and low.

Minerva knocked twice. 

When no one answered, she pushed the door open.

Frederick stood there in a bathrobe, his arm casually wrapped around Yolanda, her clothes disheveled and slipping off her shoulders. 

His head rested on her shoulder as he pressed slow kisses along her neck, completely entranced by her. His lips grazed her pale skin, coaxing soft gasps from her. 

Embarrassed, Yolanda ducked into his arms the moment she noticed someone at the door.

Frederick chuckled and affectionately ruffled her hair before finally glancing at Minerva.

"Did you bring it?" he asked.

Minerva didn't hand him the condoms right away. Instead, she looked up and said, "I need to tell you something."

Frederick averted his gaze. His voice was raspy as he asked, "Does it have to be now?"

"Yes. I'll only say it today. If you want to hear it, I'll tell you. If not, you can forget it."

Either way, he would learn the truth in two weeks.

Minerva's voice was calm, flat even. 

Frederick didn't seem to take her words seriously. He kept twirling the ribbon on Yolanda's blouse and challenged, "You really think now's a good time?"

Minerva's eyes followed his moving hands, landing on the bulge beneath his robe. A sharp ache hit her chest.

She understood exactly what he meant.

Years ago, back in school, they had once found themselves locked inside the gym by accident during winter. It had been freezing at the time. Frederick held her close to keep her warm.

At first, it was fine. But somewhere in the dark, Minerva had felt something hard pressing against her back. When she realized what it was, she flushed a bright shade of red and tried to pull away.

Frederick had just chuckled and brushed her nose lightly with his fingertip. 

Then, he whispered in her ear, "Minerva, do you know what it means when a guy reacts like this around someone?"

Later that night, she curled up under her blanket and searched for the answer. She found out that it only happened when a guy was around someone who made his heart race.

At that moment, her face heated up like she had a fever. For a long time after, she couldn't even look him in the eye.

But now, Yolanda was clearly the one who made his heart race.

Looking at them tangled together so intimately, Minerva didn't want to embarrass herself any further.

She stepped forward and laid out the ten boxes of condoms one by one on the coffee table. Then, she turned and walked away without another word.

"I understand now. Goodbye… Frederick."

The address made Frederick's brow furrow instantly. His voice rang out behind her, sharp with disbelief.

"What did you just call me?"
