My father is an incredibly wealthy businessman, one of the richest men in the world.

He once declared that if anyone dared to harm a hair on his precious daughter's head, he would make them disappear from the face of the earth.

But my stepmother Vanessa and stepbrother William doted excessively on Melody, a singer from a nightclub. They even allowed her to impersonate me at a gala dinner attended by wealthy elites, letting her sit in the place of honor meant for the true Chloe Collins.

When I showed up, Melody tried to drive me away forcefully.

"How dare a low-class singer like you try to attend tonight's exclusive gala?" she sneered.

"Mom and William have already let me take your place as the real Chloe Collins. You should leave now before you embarrass our family any further."

In my previous life, I was weak-willed and didn't dare anger my stepmother and stepbrother. I tolerated all of Melody's abuse.

But now I've been reborn.

Looking at the arrogant and domineering Melody, I walked up and slapped her hard across the face.

"You ignorant nobody. A small gala like this has gone to your head," I said coldly.

"Who do you think you are? You're not fit to use the Collins name."
