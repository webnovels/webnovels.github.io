My wife accused our son of trying to harm someone, just because he poured a glass of cold water for her male bodyguard who was coughing.

“Don’t you know cold water makes a cough worse? You’re so young and already learning to hurt people. What will you be like when you grow up?”

She grounded Leo for 24 hours, saying she wanted to teach him a lesson.

I begged her, telling her Leo had a high fever and urgently needed treatment. I even offered to take the punishment instead.

But Victoria scoffed, “You’ve spoiled him rotten. Now he’s faking sickness to avoid responsibility? He needs to be locked up for a few more days to learn some manners.”

She was afraid I’d make trouble, so she locked me in another room. I crashed through the door, desperate, but Leo didn’t make it. He died on the spot from the fever.

Three days later, as I was packing Leo’s things, Victoria returned from her trip with Julian, the male bodyguard. She was beaming, plucking a single rose from the 999 Julian had given her and handing it to me.

“Stop acting. He was just grounded for a few days, what’s the big deal? Worst case, I’ll take you two on a trip in a couple of days to cheer him up.”

But she didn’t know. Our child was dead. And I couldn’t live with her anymore.
