"The king told me to pick a mate from either the vampires or the werewolves.
I was instantly drawn to Darian, the werewolf. No hesitation, I chose him.
On our wedding day, Darian marked me in front of his entire pack, binding us as partners.
His childhood sweetheart, Finny, freaked out and ran off. Stupid bitch wandered right into the path of hunters who tore her to shreds.
Afterward, Darian showed up at the scene, stared at Finny’s mangled body, and said nothing.
Just scooped her up and buried her with his own two hands.
Then he acted like nothing happened, playing the loving husband with me.
Until the moment he united the packs. That’s when he jammed a knife through my throat, his eyes burning with hatred.
“If your goddamn singing wasn't the only thing that calmed my people on a full moon, I wouldn’t have been forced to marry you!”
“Finny wouldn’t have been so heartbroken that she ran off and got herself killed by those hunters. Now, I'm sending you down to hell to apologize to Finny!”
Agony. Then, I blinked, and I was back – back to the day the king told me to choose."
