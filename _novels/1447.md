On our wedding day, desperate to pay for my mom's emergency surgery, I made a demand to my fiancé:

"Give me $500,000, or this wedding is off!"

Caleb froze for a moment, but then quickly wired the $500,000 to me.

That same night, drunk, he pinned me beneath him:

" gold-digger!"

After we were married, he constantly cheated, cycling through countless lovers.

When I tearfully confronted him, he just said:

"What makes you any different from those bitches? Oh, I forgot, you're more expensive! It cost me $500,000 just to get you into bed!"

Later, when I proposed divorce, he sneered:

"Name your price. How much do you want this time?"


"Fifty thousand dollars?"

"A hundred thousand?"

"Or maybe one hundred fifty thousand?"

His indifferent sneer echoed in my ears.

I hadn't even said anything.

A young woman's voice came through the phone:

"Caleb, you casually donated five thousand dollars to a beggar on the street yesterday. Why are you so stingy with your own wife?"

Caleb said with contempt,

"Because some people only deserve that much."

Ever since I asked him for $500,000 on our wedding day.

The love in Caleb's eyes for me had vanished completely.

I knew I was in the wrong and wanted to make things right.

But.

I cooked for him myself.

His face was full of mockery:

"How much do you want? Name your fee before I even take a bite. Let's see if I can afford it."

Even during sex at night,

he'd casually say,

"How much for tonight? Give me a number."

Countless times, I tried to explain that I needed the money before our wedding because my mom had a sudden cerebral hemorrhage on our wedding day and needed emergency surgery.

But he wouldn't believe me.

"You'd lie about your mom's life for money. Skylar, I never knew you could be so twisted."

I endured a sharp stomach pain and said calmly:

"I don't want your money. I just want a divorce."

He didn't know I was suffering from a gastroenteritis flare-up today, and I didn't even have $200 for medical fees.

Caleb still didn't believe a word I said.

A fresh wave of biting contempt washed over me.

"Skylar, if you want to prove you're not a gold-digger, pay me back the $500,000."

With that, he hung up the phone.

His words kept swirling in my mind.

Everyone thought I'd become a wealthy socialite after marrying him.

But no one knew Caleb hadn't given me a single dime since our wedding day.

My old company couldn't keep me because of my status as 'Mrs. Hayes.' After being let go, I tried interviewing elsewhere, but was subtly turned down for the same reason.

In these three years.

Every cent I used was money I'd saved from my previous job.

And it had all gone to my mom's medical bills and living expenses.

Now I didn't even have a hundred dollars on me.

Where was I supposed to get $500,000 to pay Caleb back?

I stood frozen in place, the medical bill clutched in my icy hands.
