The hospital didn't dare defy Jasper's orders. To make me fold origami cranes, they removed the cast they had just put on and replaced it with a simple splint.
Jasper turned back, his gaze cold and filled with disdain.

"I've known Fiona since we were kids. She's never lied to me, and I'll always trust her without question."

"Trying to come between us? Who do you think you are?"

The door slammed shut with a loud bang, shattering my last hope.

I picked up my phone again and dialed the number for the mountain climbing team.

"Senior brother, is there still a spot on the International Mountain Rescue Team this year?"

"Yes, I've made up my mind."

The hospital, under Jasper's orders, took off my cast and replaced it with a simple splint, all to make me fold origami cranes.

My broken bone kept dislocating, and the pain was excruciating, with no relief in sight.

Despite this, by the time the birthday party arrived, I had only managed to fold fewer than a hundred cranes.

My fractured arm was numb with pain, I was so hungry I had lost weight, and my lips were pale and colorless.

When Jasper found out, he simply dismissed me as "useless."

Even the bodyguards looked at me with sympathy.

On the day of the birthday party, I couldn't dress myself because my fracture hadn't healed.

After begging repeatedly, even kneeling at Jasper's feet, sobbing and crying, he finally had two female bodyguards roughly squeeze me into a makeshift "gown."

They then tossed me, trembling and curled up in pain, into the back seat of the car.

"Roll down the window, take down the partition. Since you like being watched so much, let them have a good look!"

Jasper's voice was icy.

It was then I realized, as I was hunched over in pain, that the short dress I wore was indecently revealing.

Desperately, I straightened my body, enduring the excruciating pain to pull down the hem of my dress, turning my head in embarrassment.

He sneered and finally told the driver to close the window.

Maintaining this stiff posture until we arrived at the venue, my forehead was already covered in sweat.

Jasper remained indifferent.

He opened the car door and glanced at me coldly.

"Get out by yourself. Don't make me do it."

I gritted my teeth, protecting my fractured arm as I struggled to get out of the car, only to stumble from hunger—

In an instant, I instinctively leaned toward the car, avoiding Jasper's outstretched hand.

My arm hit the car door, and my face turned pale.

Jasper's face darkened.

"Even learned how to play hard to get, did you? I underestimated you."

Before I could respond, he turned and walked into the hall, not giving me a chance to explain.

But fortunately, I didn't need to explain anymore.

My phone showed a message from my senior brother from the rescue team, sent half an hour ago.

[I've entered the country. The mentor has already arranged the rehabilitation hospital, I'm coming to get you.]

[The rescue team is thrilled you're joining. The welcome party is ready, just waiting for you to arrive.]

I lowered my eyes and followed Jasper into the banquet hall.

Countless strange and curious gazes pierced into me like needles, making me tense up.

"Oh, isn't this Jasper's person? Dressed like this... tsk tsk."

The malicious voice was unmistakably from Fiona's toxic friends.

I pressed my lips together, not wanting to engage.

"Hey, Adeline is here."

The star of the party, in a pure white gown, approached with a bright smile.

Jasper stood behind her in a white suit, holding her dress.

Like a wedding scene, how fitting.

I curled my lips into a sarcastic smile.

In a tone as calm as water:

"Happy birthday, Fiona."

"And, congratulations on your union."

Fiona's smile froze, then she tearfully clung to Jasper's arm, large tears falling.

"I'm sorry, Jasper. I shouldn't have worn this dress to make Adeline misunderstand, I'll go change right away..."

"Change what? You're not changing a thing!"

Jasper pulled Fiona into his arms, his eyes locked on me with disdain.

"Inviting you was more than enough."

"Following me around shamelessly and still wanting to dictate terms, don't even think about it!"

"Don't even mention misunderstandings. Even if I got engaged to her now, you have no right to intervene!"

The surrounding jeers drowned me, making me feel like a complete joke.

Seven years of companionship, and all I got was "no right to intervene."

Pain, shame, embarrassment, despair... When emotions hit their peak, all that's left is endless numbness.

"So can I leave now?"

I looked calmly at Jasper, waiting silently in his cold gaze for three seconds, then turned to leave.

The next moment, a foot suddenly stuck out from the crowd.

Caught off guard, I lost my balance and fell forward.

Simultaneously, the champagne tower beside me suddenly collapsed!

Ninety-nine tiers of glasses crashed down with a piercing "crash," shattering into a sea of glass shards.

The thin dress soaked with wine, the broken glass cutting through fabric and skin, the wounds mixed with alcohol, spreading a pool of crimson blood.

Everyone, including Jasper, was stunned.

"Adeline! You..."

"Jasper, I'm scared..."

He instinctively wanted to step forward but was held back by Fiona.

I couldn't bear it any longer, standing up amidst the glass shards, dragging my tattered gown as I staggered outside.

A modest sedan was parked at the entrance, my senior brother rushing out of it towards me anxiously.

Behind me was Jasper's shouting voice.

"Adeline! There are doctors here, come back and sit down!"

"Adeline! Come back!"

I clenched my trembling hands, palms covered in cuts, blood dripping.

I didn't look back, nor did I glance at Jasper again.

Until I was admitted to the hospital, I couldn't stop trembling.

"Your fractured arm has been repeatedly injured. Even when it heals, you'll only be able to do normal activities. Strenuous exercise is out of the question."
