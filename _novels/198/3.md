The thin paper's sharp edges cut my cheek painfully.

"Do you think you can pressure me into changing my mind by using my mom?"

"This kind of shamelessly using my family to climb up to the Jasper family only makes me despise you more!"

Jasper sneered, commanding the bodyguards to throw out all the decorations, furnishings, and fruit trays in the room, leaving only a barren, cold, white space.

"From today on, you're only allowed one meal a day. You can leave this room once you've folded a thousand origami cranes!"

"In ten days, for Fiona's birthday party, you'll be tied up with the cranes and brought there!"

My plastered right hand still throbbed with pain. My heart felt icy cold as I bit my lip hard, my voice hoarse.

"...Why?"

Jasper, why?

What did I do wrong to make you treat me like this?

Suppressed screams crashed around in my chest. I looked at Jasper, my eyes involuntarily turning red.

Jasper met my reddened eyes, his breath hitched. He subconsciously reached out to me, almost like an embrace.

The next second, he jerked his hand back, his face cold.

"You know what you did!"

"If it weren't for Fiona's kindness, still thinking of inviting you to the birthday party, I wouldn't even bother looking at a woman as fickle as you!"

My mind exploded.

Confusion and grievance surged within me. I searched my memories for clues but found none.

Emotions suppressed for so long suddenly surged and tore at me. I stubbornly looked at Jasper, my throat aching.

"...What are you talking about?"

Jasper's lips pressed tightly together as he stared at me, then sneered.

"With acting skills that good, it's a pity you aren't aiming for an Oscar."

"Do you really think you can hide it from me? On April 21st, five years ago, at 3 p.m., Fiona saw you on West Street..."

I froze in place.

April 21st, five years ago.

—It was the sixth month of my relationship with Jasper and the third day since Fiona returned from abroad.

I received a call.

"When will you pick up the item Mr. Asher left at our club?"

I couldn't let go of Asher's belongings, and I was afraid Jasper would overthink if he knew about our relationship, so I pretended it was a girls' gathering and went alone.

But when I arrived, I found that the club was a luxury club Asher would never have stepped into; the so-called belongings were a thick stack of white paper in an envelope.

That club bore the name of the Aiden family.

My heart sank bit by bit. I opened my mouth to explain:

"Jasper, I..."

A "ding" from the phone interrupted me.

Jasper's brows furrowed slightly, but relaxed as he saw the caller.

It was Fiona.

"Jasper, I'm worried Adeline might not have a nice dress for the birthday party, so I ordered her one. She shouldn't mind, right—"

"It's a style that's really popular among girls lately."

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the screen and froze.

—The dress in the photo was tight-fitting, with a neckline plunging nearly to the navel, barely covered by lace on the sides.

The hem was so short it could hardly cover anything.

I instinctively grabbed Jasper's sleeve, my eyes pleading.

Jasper paused, then glanced at me with a smirk, easily shaking off my hand:

"She doesn't mind, she loves it. She'll definitely wear it."

My hand fell limply, and I closed my eyes, feeling dead inside.

The call ended, and Jasper turned to leave, leaving two solidly built bodyguards behind.

As the door was about to close, I called out to him.

"Jasper."

He stopped in his tracks.

"What if I told you... Fiona lied to you?"

I croaked, my voice so faint it was almost inaudible.

Jasper turned back, staring at me, his gaze icy and disdainful.

"Fiona and I grew up together. She's never lied to me, and I'll always trust her unconditionally."

"Trying to sow discord between us? Do you think you're worthy?"

The door slammed shut with a loud bang, shattering my last hope.

I picked up the phone again and dialed the mountain climbing team's number.

"Senior, is there still a position available in this year's International Mountain Rescue Team?"

"Yes, I've decided."
