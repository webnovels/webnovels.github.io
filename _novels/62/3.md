I know there's a popular story online recently. It talks about a man who, upon learning his wife was having an affair at school, couldn't accept it and biked to the school to get the truth. For three days and nights, he rode a bike from Qingdao to Tai'an, covering 300 kilometers! Riding day and night, scaling tall gates alone. Fighting for love, facing five enemies alone. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a hoax.

But now, I'm rushing to Qatar for love too! I used PayPal credit card to buy the next available flight, heading straight to Doha, Qatar. To catch her off guard, I didn't call Chloe. I first went to her company dorm, only to find out a frustrating truth! Chloe never stayed at the dorm! So where has she been living for the past six months? I asked her colleagues where Chloe was. Those glamorous flight attendants claimed they didn't know, but I could see in their eyes they pitied me. They must think I'm a poor fool, a cuckold! I could hear their mocking behind my back as I left.

"Well, Chloe's going to get it now!" "Yeah, serves her right for always trying to show off!" "Right, always flirting with the Indian instructor."

In the end, a security guard, an Indian guy, took pity on me and secretly told me. During the Qatar World Cup, if they had free time, Chloe and many flight attendants liked to visit bars near the athlete's village. Their intentions weren't just for drinks. Many World Cup players, coaches, family members, and FIFA officials frequented those bars. Although their skin colors and nationalities varied, they shared one common trait—they were all rich. Especially the players, all strong and athletic, were the favorites of these gold digger women! They could earn money and enjoy themselves!

I was furious and took a cab to the bar area they mentioned! At the bar entrance, I tried to get in, but the bouncer asked for my ID. He said this was a leisure spot for World Cup personnel, and outsiders weren't allowed. I pointed to a few blonde beauties heading inside, "Why aren't you stopping them? Do they need IDs too?"

These individuals, regardless of their skin color or nationality, have one thing in common: they're all wealthy. Especially those athletes, each one strong and fit. They're the favorites of these gold-digging women! They earn money and enjoy life!

When I heard this, I was furious and immediately took a cab to the bar district they mentioned! Upon arriving at the bar entrance, I tried to go in, but the security guard asked for my ID. They explained that this was a leisure spot for World Cup personnel, and outsiders weren't allowed.

I pointed to a few blonde beauties walking in and asked, "Then why don't you stop them? Do they need IDs too?"

The security guard gave me a knowing look. "Heh, heh, men aren't allowed, but women can go in freely."

I had no choice but to wait outside. An hour later, I saw my wife walking out of the bar, arm in arm with a black man, heading into a small alley!

It was clear they weren't up to anything good! I clenched my teeth and followed them.

Once in the alley, I looked around and finally found them behind a trash can, exchanging flirtatious banter.

I couldn't hold back anymore. I picked up a brick from the ground and rushed forward, striking the man on the head with it! He fell forward, taking Chloe down with him.

When the cheating woman turned around, she finally noticed me!

"Ethan, why are you here?" Chloe asked in surprise.

I was shaking with anger. "How dare you ask me that? Look at what you've been doing! Aren't you afraid of getting AIDS with these black men?"

Chloe's face turned cold. "Watch your mouth! What do you mean by 'black men'? He's a VIP client of our company! I'm working hard for our family, you know. Times have changed, and everyone is more open-minded now. Don't be so unsophisticated, okay?"

"VIP? You're a flight attendant, not a hooker! I'm so disappointed in you! Let's get a divorce!"

When she heard me mention divorce, Chloe laughed. "Divorce? Sure! I was planning to keep milking you for living expenses! Now that you know everything, I won't hide it anymore! Let me tell you, from the day I left the country, I never planned to come back! My dream is to immigrate abroad! Marrying you was just a temporary plan to settle for now! You fool, supporting me, working tirelessly for me! Luckily, I met Jack in Qatar! Jack is not only the younger brother of the captain of the Cameroon national team, but he's also a professional player. His father is a tribe chief! Do you know he's an African prince? He’s already proposed to me! You’re of no use to me anymore! Remember, I'm the one dumping you!"

"Hehe, I was tired of playing the dutiful wife and mother in front of you. I'm done pretending, I'm free now!"
