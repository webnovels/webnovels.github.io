My wife, Chloe, is a flight attendant. To further her career, I sent her to train at Qatar Airways. Recognized as the best airline globally, experience there would mean a promotion and salary increase back home.

Qatar is a land of affluence, with high living expenses. Chloe's monthly costs are between 40,000 to 50,000, forcing me to save every penny to support her. My monthly expenses are only 1,000, and I've even sold my car, riding shared bikes to and from work daily.

One evening, Chloe's cousin, Emily, came to see me. "Brother-in-law, there's something I've wanted to tell you. My sister is a cheating woman, and she's been unfaithful countless times! You're such a good man; it's unfair for you to be married to someone like my cousin. You've sacrificed so much for her, always scrimping, yet she's never stopped cheating on you!"

Emily was visibly upset. To be honest, Emily is stunning, even more attractive than my flight attendant wife. At the moment, she's wearing a beige trench coat over a light blue dress, looking captivating despite the cold weather. Her long legs, wrapped in black stockings, are alluring, her calves slim and elegant, standing tall in red high heels. Her usual work involves modeling products like stockings and lingerie, with her ads showcased on various e-commerce websites.

Men are drawn to beautiful women. If I weren't already married to Chloe, I'd likely be attracted to Emily too. However, I sternly told Emily, "Emily, how can you speak about your cousin like that? I know you have feelings for me, but I'm your brother-in-law. I'm not a man who takes things lightly, and our relationship is strong. Please don't come between us!"

I'm not conceited, but I've long noticed Emily's interest in me. She often gives me flirtatious looks. Especially after Chloe went abroad, Emily frequently visited, using the excuse that no woman was taking care of me. She'd do my laundry, clean the house, and manage chores, even washing my underwear by hand without complaint and cooking meals for me, saying my diet was lacking.

There's no way I, Ethan, would let anything happen with Emily in reality. I won't do anything immoral! Chloe is a virtuous woman, and I can't betray our relationship. She said she went to train with Qatar Airways for career development, to contribute to our family.

Hearing my blunt words, Emily blushed, looking a bit hurt. She bit her lip, "Brother-in-law, to be honest, I do like you. I had feelings for you before my cousin did, but she acted faster. But I'm not an immoral homewrecker! If you and my cousin are happy, I'll only wish you well and not destroy your family. But that's not the case! My cousin's been playing with your emotions! Spending your money while making a fool of you! I can't bear to watch! I feel you're being mistreated, and it's not worth it!"

Emily's voice was loud. Fearing I wouldn't believe her, she handed me her phone. "This is their internal group chat. Besides the flight attendants, it's filled with VIP guests they've targeted! Some guest leaked the chat records! Look at what my cousin said in there!"

I was dumbfounded when I saw the screenshots. It was a conversation between Emily and a first-class passenger! They were flirting, and it was explicit!
