My husband Liam was a Special Forces captain. My best friend was a military doctor.

They didn't get along at first. I was the one who brought them together.

Five months into my pregnancy, I found a heavy metal box at home.

Inside, I found a stack of wills he'd written before every dangerous mission. As I opened them, a chilling dread washed over me.

Seven hundred and thirty-two letters in total.

Every single one started with, "My Dearest Chloe."

And every single one ended with, "I love you, Chloe."

Chloe. Not some stranger, but my best friend.


I knelt amidst the scattered pages, my fingertips trembling so violently I couldn't even grip a single sheet. Tears streamed down my face, blurring the words on the paper.

"Chloe, make sure you have an extra slice of that apple pie from the west side tonight. You know the one you love."

"Chloe, I'm sorry to make you sad again."

"Chloe, after I die, please scatter my ashes under the old oak tree, so I can always watch over you."

The old oak tree.

Our old oak tree.

The devastating news of my parents' deaths arrived when I was eight.

I curled up in a corner of our home, crying until no sound came out.

Liam and Chloe, one on each side, stubbornly held my hands and led me away from the house.

We ran to the old oak tree on the back hill, the one that had stood there for who knows how many years.

Tears still stained Chloe's face, but she raised three fingers, pointing at the trunk, her voice choked but incredibly clear.

"I swear, from now on, I'll protect Alice for her mom and dad for the rest of my life! No one is allowed to bully her!"

Liam immediately mimicked her, his face serious, his voice even louder.

"Me too! I'll protect Alice for the rest of my life! Even longer than you!"

And they did.

My world felt safe and bright because they were in it.

My baby, sensing my turmoil, kicked uneasily within me.

I instinctively clutched my belly, but my fingertips brushed against the scattered letters on the floor.

My vision blurred again.

I futilely tried to shove the letters back into the box.

But my hands wouldn't obey, just clawing at them aimlessly.

Each letter felt like a burning ember, scalding my insides, making my stomach churn with agony.

I don't know how much time passed, but eventually, I leaned back against the wall, utterly drained, soaked in cold sweat.

Footsteps drew closer from outside, accompanied by their familiar bickering. Chloe's voice, bright and clear, carried her usual disdain for Liam.

"Liam, slow down! You're always so rushed. You nearly dropped the apple pie! Buying two wasn't enough, you had to clear out the whole store?"

Liam's voice was deep, laced with his usual impatience.

"What do you know? Alice's cravings are unpredictable these days. What's wrong with buying extra? What if she suddenly wants some?"

The door opened.

Chloe peeked her head in first. Seeing me on the floor, she rushed over, reaching out to help me up.

"Why are you sitting on the floor? Pregnant women shouldn't be sitting on the cold floor. Come on, up you go!"

Liam also hurried over, feeling my forehead with one hand while steadying me with the other.

"What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell somewhere?"

I let them both help me up.

Chloe was the first to notice my puffy, red eyes. She pressed urgently.

"Why are your eyes so swollen? Did Liam upset you? Tell me. I'll make him pay!"

Liam shot her an irritated look.

"Chloe, don't be ridiculous. I adore my wife. I'd never hurt her!"

He turned back to me, his hands cradling my face gently, eyes full of concern.

"Honey, what is it?"

"Who upset you?"

"Or is it your stomach? I'll take you to the hospital now."
