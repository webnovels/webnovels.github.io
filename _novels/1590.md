While waiting for my husband in the parking garage, I stumbled upon a viral post on a local online forum.
The title was: “What do you do when your wife is too clingy?”
Amidst a sea of syrupy sweet humblebrags, one comment from a female user caught my eye.
“Easy, you play the incompetent card! My childhood sweetheart was forced to marry someone he didn’t love. I gave him an idea: for five years, he pretended to be pathologically directionally challenged.”
“Then, when his wife got pregnant, he secretly mixed lubricant into her shower gel. She slipped and fell. On the way to the hospital, he pretended to get lost again, deliberately driving in circles on the outskirts of town. She miscarried and is now permanently infertile.”
“Today is his wife’s tenure review day. He’s insisting on driving her, but it’s just another act. He’s going to ‘get lost’ to make her miss it, so I can get the position instead.”
“Once she fails her review, he’ll persuade her to quit her job, turn her into a helpless housewife, and then kick her to the curb.”
The chilling familiarity of the story sent a tremor through me. Before I could process it, my husband’s voice, thick with guilt, sounded beside me.
“Ava, honey, I think… I’m lost. We’re not going to be late for your tenure review, are we?”
I turned my head and met Kevin’s gaze, his eyes a murky, unreadable pool.
“The review starts in ten minutes. I’m not going to make it.”
Kevin squeezed my hand, his face a mask of apology. “Honey, I’m so sorry. I swear I went over the route a dozen times this morning. The GPS didn’t even say I took a wrong turn.”
He sighed dramatically. “Maybe it’s a sign from the universe. A sign that the world is just as heartbroken as we are about the baby we lost. Maybe this is its way of telling us to focus on our family.”
His words echoed the forum post, each syllable a hammer blow against my heart.
He’d faked it for five years. He’d made me lose our child on purpose. And now, he was trying to manipulate me into quitting my job, to make me dependent and useless, just so he could discard me.
A faint, cold smile touched my lips.
“You’re right. In that case, you should quit your job today. We can stay home and work on our relationship.”
Kevin choked, speechless.
After a long silence, he let out a soft sigh. “Ava, you’re still angry with me about the baby, aren’t you?”
“He was my child, too. It broke my heart.”
“You’ve always known I get lost easily. When it happened, you should have called 911 yourself instead of waiting for me to drive you!”
His complaint was so absurd I almost laughed.
He claimed to be directionally challenged.
That’s why a twenty-minute drive from his office to our home would take him four or five hours. Sometimes, he’d just text and say he was sleeping at the office. Yet Chloe’s apartment, nearly an hour from his work, was a drive he could make in thirty minutes flat.
Dates with me were always prefaced by hours of waiting because he’d “gotten lost.” But a single call from Chloe, and he could cross mountains and rivers to be by her side in an instant.
I can’t count the number of times I screamed at him for it. But every single fight ended with me apologizing. Torn between rage and the fear of losing our ten-year history, I was trapped in a cycle of madness and remorse. When I finally got pregnant, the thought of leaving him vanished completely.
I thought if I just loved him a little more, one day he would see my worth. He would change. We could still be a happy family.
Until one month ago, when his “getting lost” made me miss the critical window for medical intervention.
I had wanted that baby for five years.
And in the end, I couldn’t protect him.
In a twisted way, maybe it was for the best. At least now, he could be reborn to parents who would truly love him.
Hearing my hollow agreement, Kevin’s expression shifted. Before he could say anything else, his phone rang—the custom ringtone I knew belonged to Chloe.
He answered, and her ecstatic voice flooded the car. “Kevin! I got the professorship! Come pick me up from the university later. We have to celebrate tonight!”
Kevin’s eyes flickered toward me.
I smiled. “Go ahead. I’ll get a cab.”
I got out of the car without a second thought. I could feel his gaze on my back, but I didn't turn around.
The moment I got home, a text from him arrived.
I’ll be home early tonight. Please wait for me. We need to talk.
I didn’t know what he wanted to say.
But I knew one thing: he wouldn't be coming home.
As expected, he didn't. I was used to it.
Before Chloe moved back, Kevin and I had been happy. Back then, he hadn't yet developed his “pathological directional disorder.” He would take me to trendy spots every weekend for photoshoots, and we’d explore food stalls, trying everything I wanted. He knew I loved fairytales, so he proposed at Disneyland. In front of a cheering crowd, he got down on one knee.
“Ava,” he’d shouted, his voice thick with emotion, “this city is full of lights and noise, but without you, it’s empty. A place without you isn’t a home. Will you give me a home?”
I’d said yes without hesitation. He’d spun me around, swearing to the world, “I, Kevin, will love only Ava for the rest of my life. I will take care of her and only her. I hope Ava will be mine forever.”
How could I have known that his “forever” would only last a few short years?
I knew he had a childhood sweetheart before we got married. He told me Chloe had settled abroad and would probably never come back. He said she was just like a little sister to him. But shortly after our wedding, she suddenly returned. With Kevin’s help, she became my colleague at the university. And just as suddenly, Kevin forgot the way home.
When I confronted him, he turned it on me. “You think I want to be like this? It’s because you’re always picking fights, keeping me on edge! It’s caused this rare neurological condition!”
“Chloe needed help finding a job. Of course I was going to help her.”
“Ava, for God’s sake, you’re a university lecturer. Can’t you be less insecure? Is it so impossible for a man and a woman to have a platonic friendship?”
“Just because you didn’t have a childhood best friend doesn’t mean I can’t have one!”
“If I had known you were this jealous, I never would have married you.”
If I had just walked away the first time he said those things, maybe none of this would have happened. But there are no do-overs in life.
It’s for the best. After being hurt time and time again, letting go doesn’t feel like tearing my own heart out anymore. Now, I was just weaning myself off him, waiting for the right moment to cut the cord.
I just didn’t expect that moment to arrive so soon.
I was in the middle of a lecture when a swarm of reporters burst into my classroom, cameras flashing in my face.
“Are you Professor Ava Ross?” one of them shouted.
I frowned. “Who are you? I’m in the middle of a class. Please leave immediately!”
They didn’t move. Instead, they shoved their microphones in my face.
“Professor Ross, do you have any comment on the allegations of academic fraud and plagiarism?”
“Did you deliberately skip the tenure review because you had something to hide?”
“Do your students know their esteemed professor is a fraud?”
For a second, I thought I was mishearing them. But the suspicious looks from my students told me it was real.
I stared at the hostile faces of the press. “I have never committed academic fraud!” I declared, my voice ringing with conviction. “And I have never plagiarized anyone’s work! If you continue to spread these lies, I will sue you for defamation!”
As my words faded, a snide laugh came from the crowd. “Professor, give it up. Your own husband has already issued a public apology on your behalf!”
That paper… I had spent six months of my life on it, poring over countless sources. Kevin knew. He knew how much it meant to me.
I called him frantically, desperate for an explanation, but he didn’t pick up.
Just like that, I was suspended from my duties.
Kevin finally came home that evening. The second he walked through the door, I slapped him. The sound cracked through the silent apartment.
“Kevin, I already gave up the professorship for Chloe. Why would you help her frame me like this? Why are you doing this to me?!”
His head snapped to the side. To my surprise, he wasn’t angry. He slowly ran his tongue over the inside of his cheek and chuckled.
“Ava, I knew it. All that understanding and grace you’ve been showing lately… it was all an act.”
“See? All it took was a little push, and the real you came out.”
I stared at him, my eyes red, my heart pounding with disbelief. “So you ruined my career… just to prove a point? Kevin, you’re insane!”
He shook his head. “Not just for that.”
“Chloe just made professor. She needs a high-quality publication to solidify her position. Your paper was perfect.”
“Don’t look at me like that. You should be flattered I found your work worthy. I know this is a little hard on you, but don’t worry, I’ll make it up to you in time.”
“Besides,” he added with a chillingly casual air, “you just had a miscarriage. This is the perfect opportunity for you to take some time off and rest.”
I was shaking with a rage so profound it left me speechless. He, on the other hand, started humming a cheerful tune as he walked into the bedroom. A moment later, I heard his voice, soft and gentle.
“Chloe, don’t worry. I’ve handled Ava. She won’t cause you any trouble.”
“You just focus on preparing for the international symposium next week.”
“I promise, as long as I’m here, I won’t let anyone hurt you.”
Hearing the tenderness in his voice, a cold, hard hatred began to bloom in my chest. Just then, my phone buzzed. A message from Chloe.
[Ava, that paper of yours is really well-written. Thanks!]
[The paper, the professorship, Kevin himself… if I want something, you’ll never be able to compete.]
[So, if you have any self-respect left, you’ll just disappear. Don’t wait until you’ve lost absolutely everything.]
That was it. The last thread of my sanity snapped.
