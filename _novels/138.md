When I accompanied Lucas to a party, my entire body suddenly broke out in an allergic reaction.

As the itching intensified, red rashes appeared on my exposed skin, spreading to my cheeks.

"Sis-in-law, did you use some cheap makeup? Your face is swelling up like a balloon," someone sneered.

"How did Lucas end up with a girlfriend like this? So embarrassing."

"That dress you're wearing costs a fortune. Can you afford to ruin it by scratching?"

Amidst the mocking voices, I panicked, not knowing what to do.

Lucas smiled and quieted everyone down. He took out a pill and said to me:

"It's an April Fool's Day party. You won't get mad at a little joke, right?"

Later, I realized the truth.

For three years of our relationship, I was nothing but a toy for Lucas and his friends to fool around with.

But Lucas, I only fooled you once.

Why are you crying your eyes out now?
