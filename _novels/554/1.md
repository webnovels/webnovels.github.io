Everyone was convinced it would be a zombie apocalypse.

Harper, with her formidable combat skills, was instantly elevated to the status of a living savior.

As for me, with my water-based power, I was labeled a useless freak.

“I believe your power is water, isn’t it? You lame-ass, with that pathetic ability of yours. What, are you planning to go spray the zombies awake?” Harper, my arch-nemesis, sneered. “Tell you what, why don’t you get on your knees, grovel a bit, then sleep with that homeless guy over there, and finally transfer eight hundred thousand to me? Then I’ll consider protecting you, no hard feelings. What do you say?”

But soon after, the sun fractured, splitting into three.

It turned out to be a scorching heat apocalypse.

And there I was, riding my husky, Mochi, like a deity incarnate. “You pathetic losers, kneel before your Queen!”

**1**

On the day the nine stars aligned, the most revered Oracle in the sanctuary delivered a chilling prophecy: a week from then, a devastating apocalypse would arrive.

After uttering his prediction, the Oracle departed from this world.

From then on, no one knew what kind of apocalypse it would be.

As for me, upon hearing the news, I was so excited I tumbled down the stairs and injured my leg. I was left hobbling around on a crutch, limping out the door.

Only…

I’d barely taken a few steps outside when Mochi, my husky, came trotting out. The little jerk immediately started mimicking my limp.

Right behind him, a Corgi, a Golden Retriever, and a Shiba Inu quickly followed, copying Mochi’s absurd walk.

Seriously? What is wrong with you guys?

Fuming, I raised my crutch, ready to whack them.

Just then, a startled cry came from nearby:

“Look at those dogs! Their walk is so weird. What if they’ve caught the zombie virus?”

“The Oracle’s apocalypse prediction… it couldn’t be a zombie apocalypse, could it?”

My lips twitched. Without a word, I swung my crutch right at Mochi’s butt. He yelped, then bolted, charging toward the chatting group with an even more bizarre limp.

Seeing this, the group looked even more terrified, running several blocks with Mochi hot on their heels.

The news of a zombie apocalypse spread like wildfire.

**2**

As soon as the news broke, Harper, possessing the most powerful combat ability, was instantly hailed as the savior, poised to rescue the world.

Unfortunately, Harper and I had a bit of history.

It was nothing original—just the cliché scenario where her crush confessed his feelings to me.

Even though I turned him down, for some reason, she was hell-bent on labeling me a shameless bitch.

“Looking to buy instant noodles? Fine, get on your knees and beg me nicely, and I *might* consider selling them to you.”

I’d just picked up a pack of instant noodles when an unwelcome guest appeared.

Harper, chin haughtily raised, arrogantly kicked me – crutch and all – sending me flying.

I gasped, a sharp sting shooting through me.

Combat powers were no joke; she really knew how to make it hurt.

I scrambled back up, rubbing my bruised arm. “Do these instant noodles have your name on them? Do I need your permission to buy them?”

At that, Harper burst into what sounded like the biggest joke ever. “Oh, everyone, listen up! Is this little bitch dreaming? Did she hit her head when she fell? I’m dying laughing. Does she even know what my status is now?”

The people around us immediately chimed in:

“Yeah, do you even know what kind of apocalypse is coming? A zombie apocalypse! Harper’s power is the strongest for fighting in this sanctuary. She’s a hero who’s going to save the world!”

“Let me tell you, Harper’s a huge deal now. Forget a single store; if she wanted the entire bank vault, all she’d have to do is snap her fingers.”

“No exaggeration, forget instant noodles. Even if a penny fell from the sky right now, it would belong to Harper. Got it?”

“The apocalypse is in a few days. Without her, we’d all be dead. Forget about eating instant noodles.”

Listening to their endless sucking up, Harper smiled smugly. “Hear that? Zombie apocalypse. If you want my protection, you’d better behave. Otherwise… oh, I remember your power is water, right? Just that pathetic ability. What, are you planning on giving the zombies a refreshing shower?”

Waves of laughter erupted around us.

I just smiled slowly, unhurriedly, blinking my eyes. “But I remember the Oracle’s prophecy didn’t specify what kind of apocalypse it would be, did it? Who said it’s definitely a zombie apocalypse? What if it’s a heat apocalypse?”

**3**

At my words, everyone froze, seemingly pondering what I’d said.

Seeing their resolve waver, Harper quickly jumped in:

“Heat apocalypse? It’s been raining constantly for months! How could it be a heat apocalypse? I think you’re just jealous that I can save everyone!” “Don’t listen to this little bitch spreading dangerous lies! Everyone saw it that day; that dog clearly mutated! Yesterday it was a dog, tomorrow it could be people! What else could it be but a zombie apocalypse?”

I let out a cold laugh. “I’ve heard of people hiding behind a dog’s bark, but never a human *relying* on one.”

Especially when it was *my* dog. The nerve!

Harper’s eyes blazed with fury, and she raised her hand, ready to slap me. “What did you say? Did you just insult me?”

Just then, Mochi, who had gone out for a stroll, came running back.

I casually grabbed a hot dog from a shelf and dangled it in front of him.

He immediately flopped down, drooling and grinning.

I raised an eyebrow. “Besides, mutated? Zombie dog? With this level of stupidity?”

The crowd whispered again, “He doesn’t look *that* abnormal…”

“What do you mean not abnormal? Look, would a normal dog drool non-stop and get this fat? Isn’t that abnormal?”

Before Harper could finish, Mochi snarled and barked furiously at her.

Harper jumped, but quickly regained her composure, her expression certain. “See? Barking for no reason! That’s a sign of zombie virus infection! Because the mutation started with Blair’s dog, she’s afraid everyone will blame her, so she’s trying to confuse you all. If you believe her and get infected when the apocalypse hits, don’t come crying to me to save you!”

Mochi barked even louder.

I rolled my eyes, utterly speechless.

Seriously? Someone calls you fat and abnormal, and you don’t even object?

And then you blame my dog for barking.

You’re literally worse than a dog.

I dug in my ear, then whispered to Mochi, “They won’t let me buy you food, and they’re calling you abnormal. Can you really stand for that?”

Then, I loosened my grip.

Sure enough, the next second, he charged at Harper, boiling with rage.

Harper was afraid of dogs. Seeing Mochi charging, she shrieked, forgetting all about her own power, and bolted.

But two human legs were no match for four dog legs.

Just as Mochi was about to catch Harper, a furious roar came from behind.

“Stop it!”

**4**

I followed the sound and saw Aiden.

The man who had confessed to me, and Harper’s crush.

Tall, with broad shoulders, a lean build, and a physique that just screamed ‘hot’ in those gray pants.

I rubbed my chin. I had to admit, Harper had good taste.

Aiden seemed to realize that telling a dog to “stop it” was a bit pointless. He turned to me, furious. “Blair, get your dog to stop right now! I know you can’t accept the news about Harper and me, and jealousy is a natural human emotion, I get that. But do you have any idea how many people you’ll get killed by seeking revenge like this? How can you be so malicious?”

When people are truly speechless, they just laugh.

Any fleeting good impression I had of him instantly vanished.

“Oh, *you’re* not malicious, so why don’t *you* go save her?” I raised an eyebrow. “Or are you scared of being bitten by a dog too?”

Aiden’s face flushed red as his secret was exposed. He retorted angrily, “How could I be? I’m being cautious! Do you even know what my power is? Healing! How many people are depending on my power to survive the zombie apocalypse? If something happened to me, could you take responsibility?”

As he spoke, he became more and more self-righteous, as if he truly believed himself to be a white knight saving lives.

I couldn’t help but chuckle. We hadn’t even figured out what kind of apocalypse it was yet, and he was already this high on himself?

What a character.

“Oh my God, a healing power! That’s definitely going to be a huge help in a zombie apocalypse! We’re saved!”

“Perfectly complements Harper’s combat power. I’m shipping it! I approve this marriage!”

“Absolutely! Only a divine figure like Harper deserves to be with Mr. Aiden. How could Blair, with her useless water power, even dream of him?”

The surrounding chatter grew louder.

I frowned.

Before I could say anything, he cleared his throat and continued, “Although you were the one who originally tried to seduce me, wearing that short dress and skirt, I admit, I was fooled and charmed by you for a while. But now it’s the apocalypse, and your water power is simply too useless. I can’t tolerate being with a nobody. So, I’m sorry, we’re not a good match. My heart now belongs only to Harper.”
