I'm a Blind Girl, But I Never Imagined I Was the Long-lost Billionaire's Daughter

My brothers found me begging on the streets.

They brought me home, promising to take good care of me.

But on the very first day, the fake daughter attempted suicide.

Everyone rushed to her side, taking her to the hospital, leaving me alone at home.

After that, the fake daughter kept having accidents, and all evidence pointed to me.

Everyone despised me.

Until one day, I was kidnapped. The kidnapper called my oldest brother, demanding a ten-million-dollar ransom.

He scoffed on the other end of the line: "Lily, what are you up to now? I don't have time for your games."

At that moment, I felt utterly hopeless.

But when I climbed to the rooftop, the kidnapper panicked.

"Girl, you're going to off yourself? Hey, have you considered my feelings?"
