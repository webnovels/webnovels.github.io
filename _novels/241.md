"The day I was supposed to get married, my bride was switched.

Not for the woman I'd been dreaming of, not for Riley Lowell, but her little sister, Riley Sutton.

Last time, I lost it. I ran, desperate to find Riley Lowell, only to find her throwing a ""fuck the wedding"" party at some dive bar.

She barely glanced up at me, slurring, ""You ditch your bride to chase after another woman? How pathetic can you get?""

This time, I walked right over, took Riley Sutton's arm, and played the goddamn part.

Riley Lowell didn’t even get a look."
