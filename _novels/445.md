I listened to my best friend's urging and planned to secretly meet my childhood friend.

As I was about to leave, a book fell from the sky and hit my head.

In the book, I constantly hurt my loving husband in order to be with my childhood friend.

In the end, I was betrayed by my best friend and childhood friend, left alone and abandoned.

I decided to play along and go to the meeting.

When my childhood friend tried to hug me, I pushed him away and made it clear we had no relationship.

I turned and walked to my husband who was standing in the corner.

He asked suspiciously, "What game are you playing now?"

"Hubby, hug me," I said.

Well, who wouldn't want a rich husband who loves you deeply?
