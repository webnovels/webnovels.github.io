My daughter held up her drawing book, pointing at the row of cars parked in our garage, asking which one she should draw.

That’s when I found out her kindergarten had assigned homework: little ones had to draw their family car.

And write a sentence: "My dad's car is a XX brand, and he drives this car every day to take me to kindergarten."

My brows furrowed at this assignment. Was this just a sneaky way to peek into our financial standing?

I knelt down, stroking Daisy’s head. "Draw whichever one you like best, sweetie."

Daisy thought for a long time, then finally said, "I don't like any of them. I like the little pickup truck the bunny dad drives in the cartoon."

She handed in her homework, expecting praise from her teacher, but instead, she faced constant targeting.

I called Mr. Harrison, the principal, to complain, but Ms. Thorne only escalated her behavior.

She even started live-streaming, portraying my daughter as a spoiled, bratty kid, leading to her being cyberbullied by thousands online.
