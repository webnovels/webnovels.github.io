The call came just before the wedding, from our wedding planner Amy.

Her voice buzzed with excitement.

"Miss Seraphina, we've finished the edit of Mr. Blake Harrison's proposal video. It's stunning. May we share it on our company account for promotion?"

I froze for a second, then smiled.

Blake and I had been together seven years. Our proposal was simple and spontaneous, just a casual suggestion after dinner. I thought this video was his secret, romantic surprise for me.

"Of course," I agreed cheerfully.

After hanging up, I clicked on the planner's social media.

The latest video's thumbnail showed Blake's handsome profile.

The caption read: "A Timeless Love Story. Seven Years Strong, He Gave Her the Surprise Proposal of a Lifetime."

I pressed play.

The video was beautifully shot. Blake's eyes held deep affection, enough to drown in. Then the camera shifted to show the woman in front of him.

She stood in a white dress, hands clasped over her mouth in delight.

My breath caught.

The woman wasn't me.
