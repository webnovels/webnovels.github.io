I hid my true identity from my boyfriend, driven by a desire to rebel against my family.

But then I overheard him say, "Ever since I found out she comes from such a poor background, I can't shake the feeling that there's something about her. To marry, it should be someone like Adeline, a wealthy heiress."

I was taken aback. "So do rich guys smell better and feel softer too?"

Just then, my phone pinged with a message from Jasper, the 'Capital Prince': "Hello, sister. Grandpa asked me to fulfill our marriage contract."

I had missed out on a truly wealthy family, and my ex was left in tears.
