In my previous life, after we saved the Media Mogul, he offered my sister and me two choices.

We could either enter Hollywood to become a star or become his adopted daughter and inherit his empire.

My sister eagerly chose to inherit the business and boasted, "Elder Sister, you should go to Hollywood and face the challenges there.

I want to be a princess in high society. Soon, you'll be begging me for opportunities."

But once she moved into the Media Mogul's home, she was constantly under the suspicious eye of his wife and lived in conditions worse than the servants'.

In the end, she was forced into a loveless marriage with an older man who was both disabled and abusive.
