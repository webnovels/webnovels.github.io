I married an idiot.

For three years, I personally fed him, bathed him, and gave him the whole world.

Then one day he woke up, became the CEO of a listed company, and spent millions proposing to me across the city.

After marriage, I became the envy of everyone. He expressed his love for me on various occasions.

But when his true love appeared, he immediately kicked me out, just to make room for her.

With nowhere to go, I swallowed a whole bottle of sleeping pills.

When I crossed over to this world, I spent 25 years pursuing the four main love interests, only to lose everything in the end.

The system said that as long as this body dies, I can go home.

But just as my consciousness was fading, I heard someone desperately begging me to live.

"Aria, I know you're awake. Why did you choose to attempt suicide on the day Sam returns? What, are you trying to frame Sam by pretending to be dead?"

Accompanied by a cold voice, I opened my eyes to see William's icy gaze full of hatred.

William, one of my love interests, was once a husband who loved me to the bone.

When we first met, he was tricked while fighting for his family's inheritance and became an idiot, insisting on marrying me.

For three years, I bathed him, washed his clothes, took care of his daily life, and gave him the whole world.

However, when the family heirs killed each other off, he suddenly woke up and became the sole heir.

It turned out that he had been pretending to be stupid to avoid disaster, and I was the real fool who had been deceived.

When I turned to leave, he knelt down and begged, spending millions to propose to me across the city.

"Aria, please don't go. I can't live without you. I may have been pretending to be stupid, but I really do like you."

Amidst flying flower petals, looking at the face I had lived with day and night, I agreed.

Until Olivia appeared, and he changed his heart.

He used work as an excuse to stay away from home for long periods.

"Why can't you understand me?"

"If I don't work hard, where will your food and clothes come from?"

I believed him.

But not long after, I found him intimate with Olivia in the office, with used condoms on the floor.

When I asked him why, he told me to leave with nothing.

I refused, so Olivia faked her death by jumping into the sea and posted a 10,000-word accusation on social media, framing me for bullying and abusing her, forcing her to die.

I was subjected to overwhelming cyberbullying.

He seized the opportunity to kick me out of the house.

My own brother also wanted to sever ties with me, this vicious person.

No matter how I explained, no one believed I was innocent.

Although I don't know why William would save me, looking at the surging hatred in his eyes, I forced out the last breath from my lungs and said with difficulty:

"Kill... me."

The next moment, William released his hand and slapped me angrily:

"If you want to die, go somewhere else to die. Don't dirty my hands!"

I was stunned by his slap.

When I came to my senses, I had already been thrown onto the road outside the villa gate by him and his bodyguards.

William folded his arms across his chest, his expression cold and indifferent, as if looking at garbage:

"If it weren't for you bullying and harassing Olivia, how could she have been forced to jump into the sea? If you want to commit suicide, remember to stay away from me. Seeing you makes me physically sick."

I laughed self-mockingly. It was clearly them slandering me behind my back, but it became my fault!

Can those with power and influence really turn black into white?

But he probably forgot that without me, he wouldn't have today!

Since that's the case, I won't dirty his eyes!

I staggered away, coming to a bustling street. Looking at the flowing traffic, I jumped.

As long as this body dies, I can go home.

The next instant, the sharp sound of tires screeching accompanied by honking horns rang out.

Someone grabbed my hair tightly and dragged me to the roadside.

"Aria, what are you doing?!"

I looked at the angry William and quietly asked:

"Why? I've already stayed away from you."

Although his words were so fierce, I saw his body trembling.

When he was still pretending to be an idiot, whenever he was afraid, he would unconsciously tremble and hide behind me.

What was he afraid of?

Afraid of me dying?

But isn't this fulfilling his and Olivia's wishes?

William slapped me hard:

"What are you pretending for? This is the road Olivia has to take to get home! If you die here, how will it dirty her eyes?"

I lowered my eyes and laughed self-mockingly. So it was because of this.

I obediently went to the riverside.

Here, it shouldn't dirty his beloved's eyes, right?
