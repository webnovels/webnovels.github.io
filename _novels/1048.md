In just five years, the praise for Isobel Atkinson had quietly shifted. She went from being "talented" to simply "lucky".

Her once-brilliant achievements were now eclipsed by the title of "Mrs. Knight".

People no longer admired her intelligence or hard work. They only envied her for marrying well.

Her husband, Dominic Knight, had risen from nothing to become a tech mogul worth billions. He was admired and envied by all.

And yet, he still treated Isobel like she was the most precious thing in his life.

When she was pregnant and would struggle, he canceled meetings overnight just to accompany her to checkups.

When she fussed over her meals, he bought an entire farm, grew the vegetables himself, and personally prepared every dish for her.

The night their son was diagnosed with autism, he held her hands. His eyes were red-rimmed as he said, "You've done enough. We'll face this together."

He didn't blame her for it.

He gave her complete control of his assets, always placed her first, and never allowed her to endure even the smallest hardship.

That was until one day, when she stumbled upon a hidden door in the basement.

…

The moment Isobel pushed the door open, a chill traveled down her spine.

The walls in the cramped space were covered with photos of the same woman. It ranged from her teenage years to her current, worn appearance. Even his computer screensaver was her sleeping face. 

It was Zara Clarke, the prettiest girl in their college. She was also a scandal-ridden celebrity at the moment. 

Dominic had built this basement himself, but it actually hid a twisted obsession of his!

Isobel gritted her teeth, forcing herself to stay calm.

Her heart started beating uncontrollably as fear twisted around her like a creeping vine.

Suddenly, her phone buzzed. Wendy Ford, a contact from the group chat of wealthy wives, sent her a few videos in succession.

"Izzie, it's regarding your husband at Mr. Bates' wedding. Well, see for yourself."

Was she referring to Ian Bates, the owner of a famous entertainment company?

Before Isobel could even wonder why Dominic hadn't brought her along, her heart skipped a beat. She then clicked into the video.

Zara had burst into the wedding venue with a bucket of red paint.

Amidst the gasps of the guests, she hurled the bucket of paint at the bride and groom.

"Congratulations, Mr. Bates!" she screeched.

Ian wiped off the red paint from his face. He glared dangerously at the woman laughing like a madwoman in front of him.

The bodyguards rushed forward, holding Zara roughly. She stumbled and nearly dropped to her knees.

"Stop it!" Dominic yelled.

Dominic quickly made his way to Zara. He pushed the bodyguards aside and stood before her protectively, then draped his suit jacket over her trembling shoulders.

Ian's gaze brimmed with disbelief, but he held back out of respect for Dominic. 

"Mr. Knight, what are you trying to do?" he asked.

A stunned silence ensued. Dominic showed no hesitation, his voice steady and clear. "I've just signed Zara Clarke to my company. I'm her boss."

The entire hall erupted in shock.

Everyone knew about the downfall of Zara's family. After Ian broke off their engagement, she'd spiraled out of control, leaving a trail of scandals in her wake. No one in the industry dared to take her on.

Ian sneered. "That's kind of you, Mr. Knight. Why take on someone like her? Aren't you afraid she'll ruin Knight Group's reputation?"

Dominic adjusted his glasses and stuck his chin up. A hint of pride flashed across his gaze.

"Her value is for me to decide. Mr. Bates, if you don't believe me, let's sign a million-dollar wager agreement. Within a year, I'll make Zara a top star. If I fail, Knight Group is yours."

He then signed the agreement without hesitation. As everyone stared at them in shock, he left with Zara in his arms.

The video ended there. Wendy's tone in her voice message was playful and teasing.

"Izzie, Mr. Knight is way too protective of her. You'd better keep an eye on Zara!"

Isobel couldn't look away from Dominic on the screen. The way he gazed at Zara, the intensity and care in his eyes, was something she had never seen.

She felt her heart sink instantly.

Doubt mixed with despair churned through her, leaving her utterly breathless.

Isobel had a sudden urge to unlock the computer in front of her. As her fingers trembled, she entered Zara's birthday.

The screen lit up.

As she stared at the sentence on the screen, tears streamed down her cheeks.

"If I'd gone to see you on graduation day, our story would've been different."

She knew this line wasn't meant for her.

Memories swept in all at once, carrying a wave of raw pain with them.

…

Back then, she and Dominic were the brightest prodigies in the computer science department.

Dominic was gifted and handsome. And while Isobel wasn't the stunning type, she was gentle and bright, with a scholar's charm.

They spent countless hours together in the library. He'd reserve a seat for her, whereas she would slip a cup of warm milk to him when he was focused on coding.

Everyone in their class had always seen them as a couple and kept teasing them.

He was always the team leader for all the group projects. Whenever she hit a wall in her code, he'd naturally lean over and hold her mouse. His warm breath would brush past her ear.

"Here, do this to smooth things out," he said.

At the university's gala, Zara stepped onto the stage like a dazzling star.

As Isobel watched the stage, she let out a quiet sigh. "She comes from a wealthy family and is beautiful. I heard her boyfriend owns an entertainment company, so she gets to debut before even graduating. A girl like her is like the moon hanging in the sky. Who wouldn't want her?"

As Zara sang a love song, the crowd went wild for her.

However, Dominic gently held Isobel's hand. He turned to look at her, his gaze clear and resolute.

He then said, "The moon's too far out of reach. I don't want it. I only want you."

At that moment, Isobel fell head over heels in love with him.

They soon became the most envied couple on campus.

They each earned national scholarships, shone side by side in competitions, and walked away with trophy after trophy.

Everyone said they were a perfect match of brains and souls, with a bright future ahead of them.

At the graduation ceremony, they delivered their valedictory speeches with confidence.

Isobel's heart swelled with happiness, for she planned to bring him home to meet her parents after the ceremony.

As the crowd began to disperse, his phone lit up.

It was a text from Zara, inviting him to her private graduation party.

Isobel froze when she saw it, then laughed warmly. "I can't believe Zara invited you. Go on. You should say yes!"

Dominic stared at the screen, his fingers hesitating briefly.

That pause of less than two seconds seemed insignificant to Isobel, who was blissfully happy in that moment.

In the end, he locked his phone and gave her a gentle smile. "Nonsense. Why would we know each other? She must've sent it to me by mistake. Right now, meeting your mom is what matters most."

Back then, she thought he had made the decision without hesitation.

Before long, they got married and shared a blissful life, growing happier with each passing day. She became certain that she was the only one he truly loved.

It wasn't until encountering this dark basement and seeing the burning gaze he directed at Zara that Isobel woke up to a sharp, painful truth.

The graduation party he never went to wasn't just a casual refusal. It was an obsession he kept buried deep in his heart and never resolved.

Isobel couldn't help but wonder what she was to him.

Was she a second choice to settle for? A stumbling block in his pursuit of love?

Isobel had no idea how she managed to walk out of Dominic's secret lair.

Lost in a whirl of thoughts, she was jolted out of her reverie by the sound of the door unlocking.
