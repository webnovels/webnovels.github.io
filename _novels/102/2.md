By the time I was promoted to director, Asher had started school.

Seeing me busy with work, Lydia offered to quit her job and handle Asher's drop-offs and pick-ups.

She pampered Asher daily. If he scraped his knee playing soccer, she'd make a fuss and rush him to the hospital.

This went on for years.

On Asher's 12th birthday, Lydia asked him what wish he had, promising to make it come true.

Asher glanced at me and said, "Godmother, I want to go to Cambridge."

My heart ached.

Had I not married Finn early, I too had a chance to go to Cambridge.

I had only casually mentioned it to Asher, and he remembered.

Lydia was overjoyed, "My son is ambitious. Godmother will send you to the best international school. With Asher's intelligence and diligence, you'll surely get into Cambridge."

She then gave my husband a meaningful look, "One day, your dad's business will be yours to inherit."

I was intrigued.

Inherit his dad's business?

Finn's company now makes less than three million annually. He squanders his eight-figure savings partying with Lydia.

This money, I'll help him plan well.

The next day, I brought out the admission brochure for the best international high school in the capital.

"Honey, Lydia, this is the school Asher chose. There are 10 spots annually for direct admission to Oxford and Cambridge. But since we're not local, there's a 5-million admission fee. Should we send Asher?"

Lydia was thrilled, "Direct entry to Cambridge?! Five million is nothing, worth every penny!"

She was ready to sell her apartment, "Selling my place, I can get at least three million."

Finn stopped her, wrapping his arm around her shoulder affectionately, "I know you love Asher, you've given so much. You don't work, you shouldn't pay. I'll handle it."

He even guilt-tripped, "Son, you mustn't be ungrateful to your godmother."

Asher nodded sensibly.

I internally laughed, then displayed a worried expression, "But I heard class placement depends on asset proof. If we spend so much and get a bad class, won't it affect his studies?"

Finn assured confidently, "Asher will be in the best. I'll prepare the materials tomorrow."

Before bed, I even saw them encouraging each other on Snapchat.

Tough days now don't matter, once Asher is successful, finding a million-dollar job won't be hard.

Once Asher graduates, they'll reveal themselves, and the three will immigrate to the UK, counting money at home.

As for me, losing my son and home, I'd have nowhere to cry.

Lydia's hatred for me nearly spilled from the screen, "Asher's heart is with that woman! Competing with me for my son? Is she better for Asher than me?! Just wait, I'll see how she begs me later."

I thought, just wait.

Who begs whom remains to be seen.

Finn acted swiftly, transferring all assets to Asher, including real estate and stocks.

He even sold his company, using cash to buy properties, acquiring many buildings and shops.

When he handed me the asset documents, I found an extra ten million.

Not sure where he borrowed it from.

The day we sent Asher to the capital for school, Lydia clung to Asher at the airport, "Asher, grow up soon. Godmother has a surprise for you."

Seeing their touching scene, I couldn't help but anticipate.

A surprise? What surprise?

Could it be better than the one I prepared for you?
