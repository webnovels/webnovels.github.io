Asher did well, getting into Cambridge.

For years, Lydia acted more eager than me. When Asher studied abroad, she insisted on following.

Asher often complained to me about Lydia's over-attentiveness.

With her care, I had more time for my career.

I started a business, surpassing Finn's previous company, with an annual turnover over a billion.

During Asher's breaks, I brought him to the company to familiarize him with operations, preparing him for future responsibilities.

Finn and Lydia were pleased.

Secretly mocking me for handing over my assets to their biological son.

Who would have thought, a year after Asher went abroad, he had a car accident, injuring his eyes.

He was left blind.

The doctor said corneas wouldn't be found soon, advising us to wait.

I was frantic, booking the earliest flight, cursing Lydia inwardly.

Had she not insisted on racing with Asher, he wouldn't have faced this tragedy.

But when Finn and I arrived, we found Asher at home, and Lydia's eyes wrapped in thick bandages.

I was speechless with shock.

Finn was distraught, trembling, hugging her despite my presence, "You gave your corneas?! How could you be so foolish!"

The surgery was at a black clinic. One misstep and both Lydia and my son could have died.

I was terrified, "Are you crazy?! Asher was lucky to be fine!"

But Lydia seemed genuinely crazed.

Repeatedly asking who was the best for Asher, who deserved to be his mother.

Asher was scared senseless by her mania.

A sedative finally calmed the situation.

Years later, Asher graduated, getting into Harvard for his PhD. Finn held a graduation party for him.

At the peak of the ceremony, Lydia barged in.

Blind, in a wheelchair pushed by Finn's mother, she cried before Asher.

"Asher, I'm your biological mother. I've sacrificed so much for you. You can't not acknowledge me!"

Lydia appeared to have truly lost her mind. She repeatedly demanded to know who was best for Asher and who truly deserved to be his mother.

Asher was paralyzed with fear by her frenzied behavior. Ultimately, they had to administer a sedative to calm her.

Years later, Asher graduated and was accepted into a PhD program at Harvard. Finn organized a special graduation party for him.

At the ceremony's most anticipated moment, Lydia barged in. She was blind, sitting in a wheelchair pushed by Finn's Mother, weeping as she approached Asher.

"Asher, I'm your biological mother. I've sacrificed so much for you. You can't ignore me!"

Finn quickly stood up to confirm, "Asher, it's true. Your Aunt Lydia is your real mother."

After he spoke, the room fell into a stunned silence.

"What is happening? How can a child someone carried for nine months be hers?"

"Exactly, a woman sacrifices so much to have a baby, and she just claims it's hers? How shameless."

"What's the story here? Did Finn cheat? Poor Nora."

I looked at Lydia, who once loved wearing Louis Vuitton and sipping coffee outside the company. Now, she looked pitiful, drab, and in a wheelchair.

I smiled slightly, "You can't just say that. Everyone knows I was the one pregnant with Asher. I still have the stretch marks to prove it. How can you claim Asher is your child?"

Lydia, clearly not in a stable mental state, smugly declared, "Do you remember when you were unconscious in the hospital? That's when they transferred the embryo from me to you."

I remained calm and continued to ask, "Why did you do it? You can have children. Why make someone else have your baby?"

"Childbirth is so painful, and it makes you ugly. You get unsightly stretch marks. I wanted to avoid all that. I told Finn, and he said I didn't have to give birth. Once you had the baby and raised him, they'd push you aside, and I'd take him back. After all, I'm his real mom by blood!"

When she finished, the room erupted with shock.

"This is unbelievable! She's awful, using someone else's body to bear her child."

"No wonder she's so good to Asher. He's her son after all!"

"Finn is despicable, using someone like that."

Lydia added, "To be honest, I was the one who made Finn marry you. Otherwise, you wouldn't even have been qualified to enter the Finn family!"

With that, Lydia lifted her chin arrogantly.

I couldn't help but smile.

"But... I have a DNA test proving Asher is my biological son!"
