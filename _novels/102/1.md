"Nora, can you call Asher out? I brought him a toy car from abroad."

Ever since I gave birth to Asher, my husband's childhood friend frequently visited our home.

She always brought expensive gifts. For Asher's first month, she spent a fortune on a gold necklace for him.

She even bought an apartment in our neighborhood to be close to Asher and secretly meet with my husband.

I pretended not to know, as usual, and called my son out.

Asher was thrilled to see the new toy.

But he didn't grab it immediately. Instead, he looked at me eagerly, waiting for my nod before politely thanking her, "Thank you, godmother."

Lydia was not pleased.

She joked, "Asher, who treats you better, your godmother or your mom?"

Asher didn't hesitate, "Mom is better."

Lydia's face turned pale, and she pinched my husband's hand hard.

My husband quickly picked up Asher and said to me, "Nora, Lydia and I will take the child out to play. You should rest at home."

His other hand comfortingly wrapped around Lydia's shoulder, as if telling her to bear with it.

I didn't stop them, just smiled and reminded them, "Be safe."

The three of them turned and left, holding Asher between them, looking like a family of three.

I watched their backs, recalling four years ago.

During a company health check, I fell unconscious for a day after a gastroscopy. They said it was due to an overdose of anesthesia.

Soon after, I found out I was pregnant.

But this child had nothing to do with me.

He was my husband and Lydia's IVF child.

That's when I overheard that Finn married me not out of love.

He didn't want Lydia to suffer the pains of childbirth, so I was to surrogate for them.

Afraid Asher would suffer in my womb, Lydia bought a lot of supplements from the start of my pregnancy.

I accepted them all without hesitation.

I also demanded an elective C-section, the best postpartum care, and three nannies.

To appease me, Finn and Lydia spent hundreds of thousands by the time Asher was a month old.

After confinement, Lydia replaced the nanny, staying until Asher could crawl before reluctantly leaving.

I wasn't angry; I actually welcomed her.

Who wouldn't like someone who gives you money and watches your kid for free?

And since I didn't have to exert effort, I returned to work right after my maternity leave.

Colleagues complimented my glow, saying I looked younger than before pregnancy.

I remained tight-lipped, only saying my husband was considerate.

That evening, Finn returned with Asher, and Lydia reluctantly said her goodbyes at the door.

"Asher, godmother is leaving. If you miss me, come downstairs to play."

Being young, Asher grew fond of her over the afternoon.

Holding the Haagen-Dazs ice cream Lydia bought, he sweetly kissed her cheek, "Goodnight godmother, Asher likes you best."

Lydia's love brimmed over at his words, and my husband was all smiles.

I chuckled to myself.

I'm also starting to like your godmother.

Though it's more like fondness for a perfect nanny.

I turned back to my room, continuing with my project proposal.
