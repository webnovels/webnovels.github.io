My wife’s startup failed. It wiped out everything we owned.

I’ve been chaining three jobs together, working triple shifts, just to ease the burden on her.

I was suspended thirty stories up, scrubbing the glass facade of The Pinnacle, while inside, a lavish birthday celebration was underway.

I glanced through the window, a flicker of professional envy mixed with exhaustion, and then I saw her—my wife, Sienna. She was pushing out a towering cake made of cash, presenting it to the elderly woman seated in the center.

The muffled chatter of the guests drifted through the glass, loud enough to catch: “The location alone is impossible to book, but Ms. Sienna rented the entire executive floor for her mother-in-law’s birthday!”

“She must have scattered millions in those cash packets at the entrance alone!”

Suspended in the air, I froze.

Nobody knew that Ms. Sienna’s mother-in-law had died in a hospital just yesterday.

When my own mother, Georgia, was sick, lying in her hospital bed, she kept gripping my hand and begging me.

“Son, stop the treatments. I don’t want to be a burden to you and Sienna anymore.”

I frantically called Sienna, desperate to ask her to let me use my payroll card—the card she managed—to pay for Mom’s treatment.

When I turned back, Mom was gone. She had jumped from the floor above.

She had neatly folded her jacket, and on top, a small stack of bills. I picked it up, my hands shaking. It was a mix of crumpled singles and tens, all folded together.

Fifty-three dollars and change.

I couldn’t find Sienna, so I rushed through the necessary arrangements for my mother’s funeral and then hurried to my window-washing gig.

Three hundred dollars an hour. It used to be enough to feed our family of three for days.

Seeing Sienna, the woman inside the opulent five-star hotel, caused a visceral, unreal sense of dissonance. Was the woman casually dropping millions inside really my wife, who just yesterday wore patched jeans and shared a simple bowl of broth and pasta with me?

The cold wind roared, and I shivered, finally shaking myself out of the stupor.

Mechanically, I pulled out my phone to call Sienna. No answer, again.

My foreman spotted the phone and signaled to the crane operator to pull me up.

The moment my feet touched the ground, a helmet was thrown at my face.

“Using a phone during work! Are you trying to get yourself killed? You’re fired!”

The helmet grazed my forehead, leaving a thin trail of blood.

It hurt. This wasn't a dream.

Lost, I stumbled toward the lower floors, where I ran into a throng of excited hotel staff.

“Ms. Sienna is handing out cash packets! All you have to do is say one nice thing!”

The ballroom was decked out in a staggering display of wealth—a million dollars just for the floral arrangements, people were whispering.

I pulled my mask tighter over my face and followed the crowd toward the noise.

When it was my turn, I stared at Sienna—resplendent in a deep-red silk designer gown and expensive jewelry—and the guest of honor. My throat closed up.

“I… I wish you a long life. Happy sixtieth birthday,” I mumbled, the words feeling like ash.

If my mother hadn’t died, she would have turned sixty this year.

Just last week, I was telling Sienna how I wanted to take Mom out for a nice dinner. Mom just squinted at me and shook her head, saying that paying off our debt was the best gift of all.

Now, we were separated by life and death.

Sienna didn't recognize my voice. She smiled warmly and handed me an envelope. “Here you go. Best wishes.”

My hands were trembling as I took the thick packet. I could feel the substantial wad of cash inside. This amount, which could have saved my mother’s life, Sienna was handing out to hundreds of strangers without a second thought!

Someone jostled me in the scramble for more packets, and I stumbled.

In front of everyone, I, in my filthy work uniform, fell to the floor.

A thousand judgmental, pitying eyes turned my way, and I felt a wave of humiliation wash over me.

As I struggled to get up, a hand reached down to me.

“Are you alright?”

I looked up. It was the other man of the hour: the mother-in-law’s son.

Owen. The very friend Sienna said she’d invested with, the one who led to her ‘failed startup.’ The man who had supposedly caused us to lose everything.

Now, I knew the truth. We were the only ones who had lost everything.

A flicker of malicious pleasure crossed his eyes, too quick to fully register.

I flinched away from his hand, intending to stand on my own, but the next second, someone kicked me.

I fell, splayed out like a turtle on its back, instantly drawing all attention.

Even Sienna was looking our way.

She started walking toward us in her heels, but I scrambled up immediately and fled. I couldn't let her see me looking like this. Not now.

Stepping out of the building, my phone buzzed.

A message from an unknown number. I accepted, and a video immediately loaded.

It was Sienna and Owen, wrapped up in each other’s arms.

Owen’s low voice cut through the silence. “How long are you going to keep up the game with that fool?”

Sienna let out a light, cold laugh. Her words echoed in my ear, brittle and cruel: “If you hadn’t bet me, I wouldn't have lasted this long.”

“The old woman is sick. If he knew I had money, he’d find a way to ask me for it.”

My mind went blank. Sienna knew. She knew my mother was sick! She had seen every one of my frantic texts begging for money, and she had ignored them.

I stumbled home, into the cramped, dark basement studio, and laughed a bitter, self-deprecating laugh. Was I supposed to admire her dedication? She lived in this dingy hole with me for three years.

She had played her part perfectly. She was always smiling and attentive to my mother, even sharing our roof. She’d told us her parents were gone and she cherished the feeling of ‘home’ she found with us.

After her ‘failure,’ I sold our house to cover the debts. Even Mom sold her most treasured possession, the jade bracelet inherited from her own mother.

I’ll never forget the way Sienna cried with gratitude when she took the money, promising she was done with ventures and would settle down with me. Her tear-stained face was utterly unrecognizable from the beaming, victorious woman I’d just seen.

Staring at the four walls of the narrow room, I finally lost control and screamed, then sobbed.

Before Sienna, I was doing well. I was the first in my family to make it to the city. I brought my mother here, vowing to give her a good life.

I met Sienna at a company dinner. She was in a cheap, faded work dress, timidly enduring harassment from a senior executive. I used a toast as an excuse to pull him away, earning a grateful look from her.

Later, when Mom brought me lunch at the office, she found Sienna sadly eating a dry bun with cold water. After that, Mom always insisted I bring an extra meal for Sienna.

Things progressed naturally. Our wedding was simple, but Sienna swore it was the happiest day of her life.

Then came the startup, the failure, and the debt. We were her rock.

It was all a game. A cruel, elaborate game between wealthy people.

I was the only one who had loved her truly. My mother, who loved her like a daughter, paid for that love with her life.

Before I could even dry my tears, the hospital called.

“Mr. Han, your mother signed an organ donation agreement before her passing. We’ve found a match. Could you come and say your final goodbye?”

Organ donation? When had my mother signed such a thing?

I rushed to the hospital, only to collide with Sienna and Owen as they were pulling out of an ambulance!

Sienna was rushing in her high heels, her voice strained with urgency. “My mother-in-law is O-negative, and she suddenly collapsed. I’ve mobilized all the O-negative blood in the city! Do everything you can to save her!”

I stood frozen, watching Sienna brush past me.

If she’d just looked up, she would have seen me, witnessed the entire scene.

But she didn’t. Even knowing my mother was sick and waiting for the money she never sent, Sienna’s entire focus was on Owen’s mother.

I walked the heavy steps toward the morgue. A doctor and nurse were waiting.

They showed me the signed donation papers. The doctor patted my shoulder. “Mr. Han, your mother was a deeply noble person. She is performing a great act. Her organs will save three families.”

I ran my fingers over the signature Georgia had carefully written. My mother, the small-town woman, who barely knew how to read, had practiced for a long time to learn how to write her name.

Now she was gone forever.

Her body… the wounds were too severe. I couldn't bring myself to look again.

I finally let the tears fall, shaking with uncontrollable grief.

The doctor’s eyes were wet. He just squeezed my hand.

After a long moment, I wiped my face and looked at the medical team. “I’m sorry. I won’t hold you up. Please don’t waste any more time.”

“I know Mom will be happy knowing she saved so many people.”

They bowed in unison, a gesture of profound respect for my mother.

Just as they prepared to load the organs for transport, a man rushed over.

“Who is the donor’s family? Our CEO, Ms. Sienna, is offering a high price for the donor’s heart as a backup!” he announced, his eyes locking on me.

He launched into a condescending explanation. “Sir, I have great news for you. Our CEO’s mother-in-law is having some minor heart issues, and we need a backup. Ms. Sienna is willing to pay five million dollars for that heart. Are you interested?”

To him, it was a massive stroke of luck. No one turns down that kind of money.

But I shook my head. “It’s already matched with the right person. You could give me ten times that, and I wouldn’t sell.”

I looked pointedly at the ambulance that had been stopped. “My mother's life may not be as ‘precious’ as Ms. Sienna’s mother-in-law’s, but you’ll have to find someone else.”

I still couldn’t believe Sienna would go to this length for Owen’s mother. Five million dollars for a backup heart.

I recalled the pathetic desperation of my attempts to borrow money, nearly bowing down to strangers. I gave a bitter laugh.

Sienna, what other insane depths can you sink to?

The assistant’s face paled, but he immediately pulled out a stack of cash and shoved it into my hand. “Money is no object! Everyone knows our CEO is the city’s top female entrepreneur!”

I paused, adding a silent amendment to his boast: and the woman who played me for a fool.

I shook my head again. The donation was Mom’s last wish. I had to fulfill it.

As we were locked in a standoff, the transportation doctor hurried out, his face grim. “Mr. Han, I’m sorry. We just received notice that your mother’s donation may have to be temporarily delayed.”

Before I could react, I was struck by something and fell backward.

When I looked up, dollar bills were raining down on me.

The assistant’s voice was full of contempt. “Your kind is no match for Ms. Sienna’s power! Mr. Owen is the love of her life, and his mother is family. This money buys your mother’s life many times over—never mind just a heart.”

I sat on the floor, my tears mixing with the bitter smell of money.

Buy my mother’s life? It would have taken so little. Less than a single packet of cash Sienna had handed out at the door.

The assistant, carrying the cooler containing my mother’s heart, started to walk away. I lunged, grabbing his leg.

“That’s my mother’s heart… you can’t take it!”

My mind was a white blur. I only knew I had to protect her last possession.

He kicked me, trying to wrench the box free. I held on tight, not letting go even as blood streamed from my head. My mother’s organ was not Sienna’s commodity to buy and sell! It was meant to save a life, not be a backup for Owen’s mother.

Just then, Sienna’s voice, accompanied by the click of high heels, drifted closer. “Little Zhang, you still haven’t gotten rid of the heart’s family?”

I froze. I wanted to call out to her. I wanted to ask what she needed to do to finally leave my mother in peace.

“Si—”

The assistant immediately silenced me with a glare and pulled me into a dark corner.

“You think you can complain to the CEO?” He sneered, kicking me again for good measure.

“Drag him away quickly! Ms. Sienna shouldn’t have to see this mess.”

I struggled violently, shouting, “I’m her husband! Ask Sienna! Ask her whose name is on the marriage certificate!”

“Ask her how she has the gall to steal her own mother-in-law’s heart!”

The air went silent for a moment. Then the assistant burst into contemptuous laughter. “Everyone at Sterling knows Ms. Sienna loves Mr. Owen like life itself. She gifted him half the company shares without blinking!”

“And you,” he scanned my battered, pathetic figure, “even the security guards at Sterling wear custom suits. How am I supposed to believe you’re the CEO’s husband?”

“Get real!”

He waved his hand, and several men dragged me away.

Separated by a single wall, my tears poured out as I heard Sienna sharply demanding to know why the simple matter wasn't resolved.

“Do they want more money? Give them more! Whatever the cost, get that backup heart secured!”

The assistant immediately bowed and apologized. “Ms. Sienna, a lunatic was here claiming to be your husband…”

“He also said…” The assistant hesitated under Sienna’s fierce gaze, then forced the words out. “He said… that heart belonged to your mother-in-law.”
