Hearing my answer, Tiffany visibly froze. She had probably prepared a whole speech to argue with me, never expecting me not to stop her. 

She eyed me suspiciously, thinking I hadn't finished, but I just turned to scroll on my phone, ignoring her.

Seeing I wouldn't say more, Tiffany put away her phone, a smile returning to her face.

“You’re right, of course. After all, not everyone gets this kind of incredible luck.”

“Just wait for my good news, sis.”

I didn’t say another word. I had no desire to relive the painful experience of my past life.

Tiffany Miller, this time, you walk your own path.

Your hell, you descend into it yourself.

Without my interference, Tiffany moved with astonishing speed. That very afternoon, she took time off work and booked a flight for the next morning to the border city where the men were located.

The next evening, Tiffany video-called me. The moment I answered, the luxurious scene on the screen dazzled me.

Tiffany was sitting in a lavishly decorated private room, a dazzling crystal chandelier hanging above her.

 She wore heavy makeup, designer clothes, and a huge emerald pendant gleamed at her neck.

“Maya! You won’t believe how amazing they are!” Tiffany’s voice was buzzing with excitement.

“They are totally my soulmates! After just a few words, they understood me completely!”

“And they’re even more handsome in person than in the video, and so incredibly gentle and sweet!”

Then she aimed the camera at the dishes on the table; each one was an exquisite work of art. “Do you know how much this meal cost us?”

She didn’t give me a chance to answer, holding up both hands.

“A hundred thousand! A full hundred thousand! Have you ever had a hundred-thousand-dollar meal?”

“And this afternoon, Kael asked if I’d be willing to marry both of them.”

“Kael and Zane said that according to their enclave’s tradition, I can marry both brothers! They practice polyandry!”

“See? What did I tell you? I, Tiffany Miller, am destined for wealth! Two high-quality men have fallen for me head over heels!”

Just then, Kael and Zane appeared in the frame, offering polite but distant smiles.

“Hello, you must be Maya, Tiffany’s cousin? Tiffany talks about you often, says you’re her best sister.”

Kael spoke, his tone gentle, but his eyes were sizing me up.

“That’s right, we brothers are both very fond of Tiffany,” Zane’s smile was still bright.

Tiffany snatched the camera back, her face so red it looked like it would drip blood. She happily announced, “Just now, I said yes to their proposal!”

She eagerly lifted her wrist, showing off chunky gold jewelry. 

“See? These are all gifts they gave me just now. They said that as long as I marry in, the entire enclave’s treasury will be mine.”

Then she glanced at my loungewear, her eyes full of undisguised pity.

“Maya, look at you, working yourself to death with overtime every day, and your monthly salary isn’t even enough for one of my bracelets. Sister’s telling you, a woman, it’s not about working hard, it’s about marrying well.”

“Don’t worry. Once I’m a rich lady, I definitely won’t forget you. I’ll introduce you to some of their enclave’s eligible bachelors with deep pockets, so you can have a good life too.”

I listened silently to her bragging, just pulling at the corners of my mouth in response. “Well, congratulations, cousin.”
