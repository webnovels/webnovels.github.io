My calmness completely threw Tiffany off. She pouted, bragged a few more times, and then reluctantly hung up.

Over the next few days, my Ins feed was flooded with Tiffany’s posts.

One day, a selfie in a five-star hotel’s presidential suite.

The next, a shopping spree with Kael and Zane at a luxury boutique.

The day after, a top-tier club with tables piled high with Romanee-Conti, and her holding a glass, her eyes glazed.

In the photos, she was always flanked by the two men, her designer outfits changing daily, never repeating.

The comments section exploded. Friends showered Tiffany with extravagant praise.

“OMG! Tiffany, did you land a sugar daddy? That’s insane!”

“Those two hot guys adore you! What kind of fairy-tale love is this? I’m so jealous!”

“Tiffany, you’re literally living the dream! Take me with you!”

Tiffany humblebragged in her replies: “Hehe, not really, I just found the love of my life, that’s all.”

She never mentioned marrying two men, simply basking in the adoration of the crowd.

I thought that after she married into wealth, she wouldn’t bother her poor, struggling cousin anymore.

Until one day, walking home from work in my neighborhood, I suddenly felt a shiver down my spine. Like a pair of eyes were staring at me from the shadows. The gaze was cold, sticky, making my hairs stand on end.

I spun around, but there was no one there, only the rustling of leaves in the evening breeze.

Was it just my imagination?

Muttering to myself, I quickened my pace, jogging back to my building. Just then, my phone rang. "Tiffany Miller" flashed across the screen.

I hesitated, then answered the video call.

“Maya!”

On the video, Tiffany’s face seemed thinner, and the dark circles under her eyes couldn’t be hidden even by a filter. But her tone was still frantic.

“I’m marrying Kael and Zane next week!”

“We’re best friends, how can you not be there for such a big event?”

“Hurry up and come be my bridesmaid, soak up some of my good luck!”

She smiled, looking perfectly sincere.

“I’ve already had Kael book your flight, all expenses paid. It’ll be a real eye-opener for you, consider it my gift.”

I looked at her slightly distorted face on the screen and sneered inwardly. Bridesmaid? More like luring me there to sell me off or harvest my organs.

“No, cousin,” I refused. “I’m really swamped with work lately, I can’t take time off.”

To my surprise, the moment I finished speaking, Tiffany’s face instantly darkened.

“Maya Reid, what do you mean?” Her voice suddenly sharpened. “I’m giving you a chance to make it big, don’t be ungrateful!”

“Are you jealous of me? Can’t stand to see me doing better than you?”

Her voice grew louder, but I couldn’t be bothered to argue.

“Think whatever you want.”

As I spoke, I reached into my bag for my keys, ready to unlock the door. But I searched and searched, and found nothing.

My wallet?

It had my ID, bank cards, and a few hundred dollars in cash. Had it fallen out on the subway on the way home…

“I can’t talk anymore, I think I lost my wallet.” I said into the phone, preparing to hang up.

“What’s the big deal about a stupid wallet?!” Tiffany was still ranting on the other end.

I ignored her and hung up directly.

The feeling of being watched grew stronger. I didn’t dare linger downstairs and quickly hailed a cab to the police station.
