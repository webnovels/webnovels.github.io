"Once I realized Carter Gallagher's feelings had shifted, I began to distance myself from him.

He favored the clothes that Juniper Bell chose for him, so I packed up all the clothes I had previously bought him and sent them away.

He enjoyed cleaning up Juniper's messes, so I had my company withdraw from any collaborations with his.

Eventually, our two companies ceased all business dealings.

I also disentangled myself from any financial ties with Carter.

After gathering evidence of his infidelity, I presented him with a divorce agreement.

Only then did he begin to panic.

His company was on the verge of bankruptcy."
