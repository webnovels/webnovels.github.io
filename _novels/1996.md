I stumbled across a post on my mother’s private social media account.
"Would an entire set of expensive designer jewelry be too cheap for my daughter's eighteenth birthday gift?"
My heart stuttered.
My parents pinched every penny, stretching one dollar to do the work of two. I couldn't believe they were considering such a massive extravagance for me!
Fearing they were overworking themselves, I screenshot a three-day, budget-friendly tour package priced at $999 and anonymously commented on the post.
"A daughter who feels her parents' love will be happy, material things don't measure up."
Five minutes later, she replied.
"Thank you for the advice, but I already took my little princess on a graduation trip to Europe last week."
"She had an incredible time."

I froze for several seconds.
My hand shaking, I tapped through to the poster's profile.
The latest photograph was a family of three posing in front of the Eiffel Tower.
The girl looked about my age.
She was draped from head to toe in high-end Parisian couture. Even her handbag—a quilted Chanel—cost more than my parents claimed to earn in a year.
My mother, Evelyn, was clutching the girl’s arm, her eyes in the camera's focus brimming with undisguised adoration. My dad, Richard, the one who always claimed to be too busy, was even cooperating, forming a heart shape with his hands alongside the girl.
In the background, I could see several bulky shopping bags overflowing with expensive logos.
My fingertips went cold.
I scrolled back to the reply.
"I already took my little princess on a graduation trip to Europe last week."
Following that was a new comment from the poster.
"But I still want to give her another surprise, so I’ve decided to book the penthouse ballroom for her birthday party and invite all her friends."
"I can’t wait to see her face light up."
The accompanying photo was a staging shot of a banquet hall—crystal chandeliers, a towering floral wall, a professional event planning team.
The location tag read: The Grand Continental, Downtown.
It was the most luxurious venue in our city. The rental fee for one night was enough to cover my family's living expenses for three years.
The last time I brought up my eighteenth birthday, I remember my mother taking my hand, tears welling up as she pleaded, "Sasha, your father's company isn't doing well this year, and my position is facing layoffs. Can we just have a small cake at home for your birthday?"
"When our situation improves, I promise I will make it up to you."
At the time, I hugged her tightly, my heart aching for her. "Mom, I don't care about all that. As long as we're all safe and healthy, that’s all that matters."
Thinking about it now, the 'later' she promised was likely a promise meant for another daughter.
The truth hit me too hard, too fast.
I slumped back in my chair at my old, beat-up desk, gazing blankly around the room.
My bedroom was no more than ten square feet, the paint peeling slightly at the edges. My desk was a relic from elementary school, its corners worn smooth and white. The most expensive item in my closet was a t-shirt that cost less than fifty dollars.
"We’re a regular family," my mother always told me. "We can’t compare ourselves to your classmates."
But now I knew: it wasn't the family that was ordinary.
It was only me.
My father leaves before dawn and returns after dark. My mother, aside from her job, is constantly doing housework. Where did they find the time to travel with another girl? Where did they get the money for a Europe trip and a lavish party?
I pulled out Evelyn's number, my thumb hovering over the dial button.
It rang seven or eight times before she answered.
"Hello, Sasha? What is it? Mom’s busy right now," her voice was rushed, and I could faintly hear the sharp, insistent notes of a piano in the background.
My throat tightened.
"Mom, where are you?"
"I'm... I'm at the grocery store, buying some food. What's wrong? Are you short on cash? I’ll Venmo you twenty dollars later."
"..."
"Why aren't you saying anything? Are you feeling sick?"

I fought to keep the tremor out of my voice.
"I need you to come home. Now."
There was a silence on the other end.
"Sasha, don't be so dramatic. I'm tied up right now, we can talk tonight."
"I want you here now!" I practically screamed.
Then, I softened my tone immediately, letting a sob catch in my throat.
"Mom, my head is throbbing. I think I have a fever."
It was the first time I had ever lied to her.
In the past, whenever I was sick, she would drop everything and rush to my side. Once, I had a high fever in the middle of the night, and she carried me two blocks to the urgent care clinic. The doctor said another hour and it would have been dangerous. She stayed up with me all night, her eyes red and swollen from crying.
"Okay, okay, I’m on my way. Don’t move, just lie down."
Hanging up, a crushing wave of misery washed over me.
My mother does care about me.
There had to be some misunderstanding about that photo. Maybe it was a relative's child, or she was helping a friend. I clung to that fragile hope.
Twenty minutes later, Evelyn rushed through the door, clutching a bag of fever reducers and a small box of expensive artisanal fruit tarts.
"Why the sudden fever? Did you kick your blankets off again last night?"
She reached out to feel my forehead, her brow furrowing.
"You don't feel warm."
As she did, my eyes caught a glimpse of a brand-new necklace peeking out from her collar. It was the same iconic piece—a Cartier Love necklace—worn by the girl in the profile photo. I’d seen it in a magazine; it was worth a small fortune.
My chest felt like it had been struck by a hammer.
Those last, desperate glimmers of hope shattered into dust.
For all these years, my mother had been good to me, but she was always strictly frugal about material things. She constantly reminded me that we weren't well-off, that I needed to be sensible. She’d say Dad worked hard and we couldn’t waste money, that they had to save up for my college tuition.
Because of this, I had repeatedly found excuses to skip class gatherings and had agonized over buying a single paperback book for outside reading.
Now I knew. Her tears and tight budget weren't about poverty.
They were about saving money for another daughter.
"Let's take your temperature," Evelyn said, shaking down the thermometer from the medicine bag.
I watched her, my heart twisting with anguish. I had always told myself to be understanding, that my parents had it tough. But seeing the truth laid bare, all that 'understanding' felt like a cruel joke.
My eyes were stinging. I finally spoke, my voice raw. It was the first, and only, time I ever challenged her.
"Mom, Jenna in my class got a MacBook Air for her eighteenth birthday."
"Sarah's parents took her to the Caribbean for five days."
"Even Beth, whose family has less money than ours, got a handmade scarf from her mother and the expensive art supplies she really wanted."
Evelyn's hand, holding the thermometer, froze in mid-air. The forced smile on her face evaporated.
"But," I said, hastily wiping my tears and forcing a weak, wobbly smile. "I told them I wasn't jealous. I told them my mother makes me breakfast every morning and hasn't missed a day in six years."
"I told them when I broke my leg in high school, she took a month off work to care for me, carrying me up and down the stairs every day."
"I told them when I bombed a test, she never yelled. She just hugged me and said, 'Try harder next time.'"
"How could she not love me? How could she not give me the best?"
"I'm almost eighteen, Mom. Maybe you're preparing a huge surprise for me."
"Mom, you..."
There was too much to say. Too much hurt.
But the tears were uncontrollable now. My throat was so tight and sore I couldn't speak another word. I just looked up at her, my chin jutting out defiantly.
Evelyn fumbled, trying to wipe my tears, but they just kept coming. She sighed.
After a long moment, she spoke in a low voice, "Sasha, it’s not that I don’t love you. It’s just... we really are struggling financially."
"Your father’s company truly has been underperforming this year, and my unit is..."
I scrubbed my face clean with my sleeve.
My voice was ragged, defeated.
"Yes, I know you’re struggling."
"That’s why I wore a forty-dollar school jacket for three years."
"That’s why my sixty-dollar backpack lasted five years."
"That’s why I never asked for a birthday gift over twenty dollars."
"I didn’t even attend a single tutoring session; I studied every night under my own lamp!"
...By the end, I was breathless, my voice just a whisper.

I looked up at her, clinging to a final, desperate hope.
"Mom, I never cared how much money you spent on me."
"I don't need a MacBook, I don't need a trip to Europe."
"But couldn't I just feel, properly feel, that I matter, just this once?"
"All I want for my eighteenth birthday is confirmation that you and Dad will always be my absolute rock."
I wanted to rip out my heart and show her how hard I had tried to be a good, sensible daughter for eighteen years, how much I had internalized their supposed 'hardship.'
But why was she silent?
Why wasn't she rushing to explain, to compensate, to cry and tell me she had a hardship, that I was her only truly beloved daughter?
"Say something!"
I shoved her arm abruptly. She was startled by my intensity and reached out to hug me, but I pulled away.
The air grew heavy and cold, broken only by my choked sobs.
Finally, Evelyn spoke: "I know we’ve let you down all these years, Sasha. For your eighteenth birthday, we absolutely will—"
"I want a party at The Grand Continental. I want to invite every single one of my classmates." I interrupted her, a surge of adrenaline pushing the words out.
I was making a desperate gamble: force them to choose. Would they choose me, their biological daughter?
The air chilled again.
Then, my mother's phone rang. It was a distinctive, expensive ringtone I'd never heard her use.
She glanced at the screen, her face paling, and made a quick move to disconnect the call.
But I snatched the phone first.
Before I could even press the answer button, Evelyn shrieked, "Fine! Your father and I will arrange a Grand Continental birthday party for you!"
The caller ID was still glaring on the screen. Izzie.
I stopped.
I didn't dare answer. I didn't want to lose this fragile, stolen moment of affirmation.
A base, desperate voice screamed in my head: I must win. I must be better than her.
I nodded slowly, handing the phone back to my mother.
She immediately powered it off, then—in a rare moment—sat down beside me to plan the party details. I let myself sink into this warmth, even though I knew it was a lie.
Then, she suggested we go shopping for my party dress.
I walked out of the dressing room, wearing a simple but stunning cocktail dress, just as I heard her on the phone again.
"Yes, my love, I'm coming right now..."
The tone was soft, tender, exactly like the one she used when trying to soothe me—but this time, I knew it was genuine.
She urgently scanned the price tag. "Just wrap up everything she tried on."
"I have an emergency, Sasha. I'll be back later to make dinner."
I listened to the electronic voice announce the four-figure total of the transaction.
I laughed, a sharp, self-deprecating sound.
The first four-figure outfit I’d ever owned was purchased as the price of her escape.
The metallic tang of blood filled my mouth. The saleswoman beamed, commenting on what a loving mother I had.
I felt utterly abandoned, my palms dug into my skin. I had already chosen to abandon the truth, hadn't I? Why was she abandoning me again?
My body reacted before my mind could. I followed her.
She drove straight to The Grand Continental.
It was my first time entering such a lavish place. I felt like a thief crashing a high-society party, every breath catching in my throat.
The concierge raised a curious eyebrow at my faded jacket juxtaposed with the crisp designer shopping bags in my hand.
Before he could speak, I slapped my ID down on the counter. "I'm looking for my mother. She booked a debutante event here..."
The concierge immediately snapped to attention, summoning a colleague. "Take Ms. Montgomery to Suite 803. This is a VIP..."
In the elevator, the attendant enthusiastically spoke about the event's grandeur.
"The economy is rough, Miss, we haven't hosted a reservation this large in five or six years."
"Your parents must really love you. Is it true you’re their only one?"
I was already standing at the door. My heart was aching unbearably. I took the room key, but hesitated.
If I didn't open the door, I could still pretend we were a happy family of three.
But a stolen, fragile bubble of happiness was bound to burst eventually.

The moment the door swung open, a young girl inside, half-dressed, immediately covered herself and shrieked.
"What is the cleaning staff doing? I told you not to disturb me! How dare you just walk in?"
She wore sophisticated makeup. The silk ballgown she was trying on was likely worth more than ten thousand dollars.
And my mother stood behind her, attentive, like a personal attendant.
Six eyes met, and the air solidified once more.
I stared at the diamond-encrusted heels on her feet.
Last month, I had found them in my mother's closet and briefly thought they were my birthday gift. They looked so elegant and expensive. I even secretly tried them on, thinking Mom had finally bought me something nice.
But the next day, they were gone.
When I asked, Evelyn stammered that she had returned them; they were too expensive.
It turned out they were meant for the girl standing right here.
I swallowed the bitter taste rising in my throat. Ignoring the girl’s shocked expression, I marched straight into the suite.
The walls were already covered with Izzie's personal photographs. From her baby shower to her eighteenth year—eighteen separate frames weren’t even enough to display them all.
My entire life, I had never been to a portrait studio. I didn’t even own a single decent professional photo. I remembered winning an academic award in middle school that included a free portrait session, but Mom refused the fifty-dollar fee for the album, saying, "Fifty dollars is enough for five pounds of steak. Wouldn't you rather have that?"
Now, those photos felt like a violent slap, waking me up to the sheer, unforgivable unfairness.
"Hey! I'm talking to you! The security here is appalling! If you don't leave right now, I’m calling the manager!" the girl finally found her voice, yelling into her phone.
"Izzie, stop it—" Evelyn rushed forward to intervene.
"Sasha, let me explain—"
"Explain what?"
I spun around, staring at my mother.
"Explain how you treat someone else's daughter like gold and your own daughter like dirt?"
"Explain how you cry poverty to me while spending fortunes on her?"
"Go on, explain it!" I roared.
