For three years of marriage, Olivia and I maintained a polite distance, appearing to be the perfect couple in high society's eyes.

But on our wedding anniversary, as Olivia lay beneath me, the name she called out was that of her first love.

In that moment, I realized our contract marriage had reached its end. But I wasn't ready to let go.

I used every connection I had to try and ruin Ethan, but not only did I fail to harm him, I ended up alienating everyone around me.

Because of this, Olivia had someone lock me in a dark basement for three days.

She knew I suffered from severe claustrophobia.

Three days later, when I was finally released from the basement, a divorce agreement was thrown in my face.

Olivia looked down at me, nearly driven mad, with contempt in her eyes.

"Jack, apologize to Ethan, then sign this!"

I lay on the ground, gasping for air, my body drenched as if I'd been doused with water.

I'd developed severe claustrophobia after an incident in my childhood. Even now, I needed at least one light on when I slept at night.

Olivia knew this. Our mansion even had several backup solar generators in case of power outages.

Yet she had locked me in a basement for three days because of Ethan.

The first day, I screamed until I lost my voice. The second day, I clawed at the walls until my fingers bled. The third day...

I couldn't bear to remember. Those three days were hell on earth.

Olivia frowned, kicking me lightly with her foot.

"Jack, stop playing dead. Get up and sign the divorce papers, then go apologize to Ethan!"

I struggled to my feet, using all my strength to shout at her.

"Olivia, have you lost your mind?! You know I have claustrophobia!"

"Three days! I almost died in that basement!"

My voice was hoarse and painful, filled with fear and disbelief.

Olivia looked at me with disdain, letting out a cold laugh.

"Hmph, stop pretending. Ethan told me that someone with real claustrophobia couldn't last even a second in that environment."

"Besides, you're not dead, are you?"

"Looks like Ethan was right. You've been lying to me all these years. But I'm giving you some assets in the divorce out of consideration for our past."

Her eyes narrowed with disgust.

"Otherwise, you'd be leaving with nothing!"

"So hurry up and sign it, then go apologize to Ethan. My patience is wearing thin."

With that, Olivia turned and left, not sparing me another glance.

I knelt on the ground, watching her retreating figure, my eyes filled with disappointment and sorrow.

I picked up the divorce agreement from the floor, my emotions in turmoil.

Did I love Olivia?

The answer was yes, at least before she locked me in that basement.

Thinking of this, I hesitated no longer, resolving to sign the divorce papers.

Sitting in a chair, I turned on my phone. An overwhelming sadness washed over me.

Missing for three days, and not a single person had tried to contact me. How ironic...

I shook my head with a bitter smile. Just as I was about to put the phone down, it rang.

"Hello? Is this Mr. Lin?"

"Yes, it's me."

The voice on the other end noticeably relaxed, then continued.

"Mr. Lin, we've finally reached you. Do you remember the physical examination you had at our hospital last week?"

"Yes, are the results in?"

"They are, but... the situation is complicated. We may need you to come in so we can discuss it in person."

My heart tightened. I asked,

"Can you... give me a brief overview of the situation?"

There was a moment of silence on the other end, then the voice spoke in a low tone.

"Mr. Lin, you... don't have much time left."
