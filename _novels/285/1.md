"'Miss, Mr. Sterling wants you in his study,'" Mr. Davies, the butler, knocked on my door.

I shot up in bed, drenched in cold sweat, the agonizing sensation of Julian tearing me apart still lingering. I had actually been reborn to the day my father told me to choose a husband.

In his study, six photos were displayed on the wall, illuminated by the projector. My father turned and smiled at me. "'Which one do you like best?'"

I scanned the faces, my gaze pausing for a second on Julian's gentle, refined smile. In my previous life, that face had completely fooled me.

"'This one,'" I said, pointing to the first photo. "'Atticus Davies.'"

The man in the photo wore an eye patch, his brows cold, his aura distant.

My father froze. "'Seraphina, are you sure? While his medical skills are superb, he...'"

"'He what?'"

My father's face wrinkled in a frown. He cleared his throat, trying to rein in his emotions. *This man was the most outstanding in every aspect, yet he was considered a last resort.*

"'Darling, there are several more options. Why don't you look at them first? His eye...'" Meeting my gaze, he suddenly seemed to recall some forbidden topic and quickly changed his tune:

"'He's a recluse! Not very talkative.'" My father quickly reached out to slide the photo, but I pressed his hand down.

"'Just him,'" my voice was firm.

In my previous life, those other men were either fake or greedy. He was the only one who wasn't.

Seeing my resolute attitude, my father could only agree.

I returned to my room, still feeling a bit dizzy. Mr. Davies knocked again. "'Miss, young Master Julian is here.'"

My heart instantly tightened.

Julian pushed the door open, with Chloe trailing behind him. Her right wrist was wrapped in gauze, and her eyes were red and swollen, looking utterly pathetic.

"'Chloe accidentally cut herself on some glass, and the wound is a bit deep. It needs professional medical attention,' Julian said, his voice gentle. If it had been before, I would have agreed without hesitation."

Chloe started to whimper on cue. "'I'm sorry, I shouldn't have bothered you, but an ordinary hospital might leave a scar...'"

I watched their act with cold eyes. In my previous life, it was always like this. Chloe would always get "injured" at crucial moments, and Julian would bring her to me. Every time I showed the slightest hesitation, he'd call me cold-blooded.

"'The Sterling family's doctors only serve me,' I said flatly. 'Her injury is minor enough for a regular hospital.'"
