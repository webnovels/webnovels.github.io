Julian's face darkened. "'Seraphina, Chloe is your childhood friend. Can't you help her?'"

"'She's a maid's daughter, not my friend.'"

In my previous life, I treated her like a real sister. As long as I was happy, my father would be thrilled. Chloe's lifestyle and upkeep were arranged to be exactly like mine, all at my request. Gradually, she started making all sorts of demands, and I tried my best to fulfill them. All because, to a "monster" like me, she was the only playmate who seemed genuinely willing to be around me.

If only I hadn't found out what happened later... I scoffed inwardly. Now, she probably thinks she's actually one of us, doesn't she?

Chloe lowered her head, masking the coldness in her eyes, then looked up at me, eyes filled with tears.

"'Seraphina, I know your top-tier doctors only treat you. And I'm just a maid's daughter, I don't deserve them.'"

"'But I'm really in pain, and I just forgot my place for a moment, even bothering Julian...'"

"'Then go to the hospital.'" I stood up to leave, but Julian grabbed my wrist forcefully.

"'Seraphina! When did you become so cold-blooded? Is it because I said a few things to you yesterday?'"

"'Chloe grew up with you, she's so kind, she never treated you like an outcast. She just had a craving and drank some of your tonic. Do you have to be so petty?'"

Petty? Even my father, the wealthiest man in the city, had to pull every connection and spend half his fortune, taking ten years just to gather the ingredients for *that one bowl of tonic*. For ordinary people, it was just a health supplement, good for beauty and wellness. For me, it was literally a life-saver, especially crucial during childbirth to prevent fatal hemorrhages.

"'Her one craving cost me a lifetime of infertility?'" I pried his fingers off my wrist, one by one.

His body stiffened, and he let go of my wrist. Chloe suddenly let out a soft whimper, and he snapped back to reality, immediately stroking her hair with concern. He turned, gave me a deep look, then pulled Chloe away.

I sank back onto the couch, feeling drained, and called my father.

"'When can Atticus return?'"

"'About another month. His research in Germany has entered a critical phase.'"

"'It's supposedly specifically for your condition.'"

My heart warmed. In my previous life, how could I have overlooked someone who, though a man of few words, always showed his devotion through actions? It must have been because my eyes were only on Julian then, a man who was only sweet and gentle with his words.

In the afternoon, Chloe came again, her face full of fawning smiles.

"'Seraphina, Julian and I shouldn't have bothered you this morning,' she said softly. 'These are rose pastries I made myself, your favorite.'"

I looked at her fake smile, a wave of nausea rolling through my stomach. In my previous life, I had eaten her pastries and nearly gone into shock on the spot.

"'Dr. Miller,' I pressed the intercom. 'Please analyze the ingredients of these pastries.'"

Chloe's face subtly changed. "'Seraphina, what do you mean by that?'"

"'Routine check,'" I answered coldly.

Ten minutes later, Dr. Miller rushed in.

"'Miss, these pastries contain a large amount of mango protein,' he said, his face grave. 'You're severely allergic to mangoes. If you had accidentally consumed them, given your condition...'"

"'I'd be dead,'" I finished for him.

Chloe instantly turned pale. "'I'm sorry, I didn't know...'"

Didn't know? Everyone in this mansion knew. And she, who grew up with me, didn't?
