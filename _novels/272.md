Julian hated me. He hated me for usurping Blair’s life for eighteen years – Blair, the true daughter of the prominent Hamilton family.

Then I died. It was a month after he forced me into an arranged marriage with Gary, a domestic abuser, just to protect Blair.

The night before the wedding, I begged him on my knees, “If I marry him, will you finally forgive me?”

He sneered, “Cut the pathetic act. You’re only fit to atone for your sins, for the rest of your life!”

A month later, the police found my body floating in a rooftop water tank. The killer had severed my tendons, ripped out all my fingernails, and broken my leg and arm bones before tossing me into the water.

But Julian, the man who had always wished me dead, went completely insane the moment he saw my corpse…

“Julian, still no word from Willow? It’s been days since the wedding.” My adoptive mother, Susan, kept mumbling. “Is she still mad at us for making her marry him?”

“Mom, she’s nothing but a thankless wretch! The Hamiltons raised her for so many years, and she complains about every little thing she has to give back! She might as well be dead for all I care!”

Julian sounded annoyed. “Blair just called, said she had too much to drink. I’m going to pick her up.”

I floated in the air, watching his retreating back with a self-deprecating smile. Of course. He still wanted me dead more than anything.

He used to be the kindest brother, my protector. But ever since I turned eighteen and they discovered I’d been swapped at birth, he became convinced that I had stolen Blair’s eighteen years of life.

He even believed that I, worse than an animal, wasn’t worth even Blair’s little finger.

“Julian, if Willow calls, tell her I miss her. Tell her to come back and see me.” Susan sounded anxious, pleading softly.

“Mom… I’m so sorry.” My voice caught in my throat. I wanted to hug her, but I couldn’t touch her.

“She’s a thankless wretch, I tell you. If she doesn’t call, just assume she’s dead somewhere!” Julian’s voice was filled with pure disgust.

I remembered when we were eighteen. Business rivals had hired thugs to kidnap us. He’d risked his life to draw them away, just so I could live. I still remembered him telling me before he passed out, “Willow, you’re my sister. I’ll be good to you for life.”

It was during that kidnapping incident, when I was severely injured, that they discovered I wasn't the Hamiltons' real daughter.

Now, no matter how much I tried to atone, I was still the ungrateful wretch he spoke of.

My nose burned. “As you wish. I’m truly dead now. Are you happy, finally?”

“Julian, I know you hate Willow, but it wasn’t Willow’s fault that she was swapped at birth back then…”

Julian’s face darkened. “If her parents hadn’t deliberately swapped those two babies, Blair wouldn’t have been out there, struggling for eighteen years! Her whole family are kidnappers!”

I trembled uncontrollably. “No, that’s not how it happened! Blair lied! My parents weren’t kidnappers!”

The day after Blair was found, my biological parents died in a car crash on the freeway. Afterward, Blair swore up and down that my parents were kidnappers, and that they had intentionally swapped the babies back then.

For eighteen years, she claimed she had suffered endless abuse in the Miller family. From that day on, Julian punished me, making me atone…
