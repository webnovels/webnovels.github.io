I Took Care of My Critically Ill Girlfriend for Three Years

When I was about to propose to her, I overheard her talking on the phone with her first love:

"I never planned to marry Daniel Thompson. Back then, I broke up with you because I found out I had severe kidney disease. He was willing to stay by my side and take care of me, so I reluctantly stayed with him. Actually, I just treated him like a servant. Now that I've found a kidney donor, we can get married after my surgery."

What she didn't know was that the kidney being donated to her was mine.

Hearing Lily say this, I looked at the diamond ring in my hand and laughed bitterly, then turned and gave the flowers to the nurse's station.

Three years of constant care and devotion still couldn't compete with her ideal first love.

I needed to wake up.

She was no longer that innocent little girl who would let me ride in the same car with her to school, who would warn bullies not to pick on me, and who would secretly slip me her snacks.

I went back to my car and ate the lunch I had made myself.

Low salt, low oil, barely palatable.

She had to eat this kind of food to control her condition.

To help her adjust, I went from only knowing how to cook instant noodles to now being able to make hundreds of dishes.

I also had to vary the staple foods. If two meals in a row had the same dishes, she would throw a tantrum and refuse to eat.

I still had to deliver meals to the hospital on time every day, watch her eat, and then finish her leftovers.

Sometimes she would smile innocently and joke, "Daniel, you're really like a dog."

At least now I wouldn't have to eat those awful leftovers like a dog anymore.

Thinking about it this way, I suddenly felt much lighter.

It turns out my love for her had also been worn away over these three years.

No wonder I didn't feel heartbroken or want to cry, just disappointed and feeling these three years were wasted.

Love is a two-way street. Fortunately, I've woken up now.

Lily called.

"Daniel, where the hell are you? I'm starving to death!"

I had already adjusted my mindset and calmly said, "Lily, Chris is coming back. I wish you both happiness."

Lily was stunned. "You overheard my phone call? How could you eavesdrop on my calls? That's my privacy! I don't care, you come apologize to me right now, or else I'll..."

I continued, "You don't want me anymore? Fine, I'll hire a caregiver for you. I'll explain the breakup to your father."

Lily was silent for a long time, then said, "Daniel, I'll say it one more time. If you don't come apologize right now, even if you come begging on your knees tomorrow, I won't forgive you."

I hung up the phone.

The hospital called again to confirm the kidney donation information. I said, "I'm sorry, I've decided not to donate."
