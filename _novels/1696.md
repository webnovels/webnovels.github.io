The moment my boss, Blake, flew out for his European business trip, the new intern, Sasha Bell, declared she was pregnant with his child.
Claiming the throne by virtue of her "royal heir," she was soon sprawled on the velvet sofa in Blake's luxurious corner office, ready to establish her regime as the self-appointed "First Lady" of the firm.
“First,” she announced to the assembled staff, her voice dripping with artificial sweetness, “No one is allowed to eat anything with a strong scent. I get violently ill from the smell of burnt microwave popcorn or takeout.”
“Second, you are all to dedicate yourselves entirely to my needs. If I ask for something, it is non-negotiable and must be delivered immediately.”
“Third, the AC is to remain completely off. The condenser unit outside is so loud it keeps me from taking my much-needed naps.”
“If any of you can’t handle these simple demands, you can pack your desk and get out.”
We tiptoed around her like we were walking on eggshells, terrified of provoking her, yet she found ways to make every minute a subtle torture.
The breaking point came fast. I finally dialed Blake’s international number, ready to burn the bridge of my career and scream into the phone, “Can you please take your pregnant fiancéé home? She’s running this company into the ground!”
But the response from across the Atlantic was not what I expected. Blake’s voice was laced with utter fury. “Pregnant what? Are you high, Ariel? I’m a single, grown-ass man, not a character in a bad soap opera!”

I had just dropped Blake off at the airport and was settling in for a much-deserved, greasy takeout lunch when my phone rang. It was Harper, my desk mate, her voice a low, panicked whisper.
“Ariel, when are you coming back?”
I stuffed a bite of my jumbo bagel into my mouth. “Thirty minutes, tops. What’s going on?”
“You need to get back here now! Sasha Bell just announced she’s pregnant with the boss’s baby!”
My jaw went slack. The bagel dropped from my hand, splattering cream cheese on the pavement. “Sasha Bell? The intern who started yesterday?”
“She’s setting up her new set of office commandments right now!”
I threw my car into gear. “Don’t panic. I’m on my way.”
Honestly, I thought Blake was just being incredibly private. As his Executive Assistant, I had zero clue he even had a girlfriend. I remember thinking Sasha’s résumé was laughably thin for a position at our firm. Now, it all clicked into place.
My only confusion was why he hadn’t given me a head’s up.
Ten minutes later, I walked into a scene of corporate chaos. The entire staff, who should have been grinding away, was huddled in the main conference room. They were gathered in a tense semicircle, bent slightly forward, and I could hear a woman’s loud, imperious voice lecturing them. She had more gravitas than Blake ever did.
I pushed through the crowd. Sasha was half-reclined on the leather sofa, one hand protectively on her lower abdomen.
The moment she saw me, her eyebrows arched in annoyance. “Finally back? Did you know the entire company was waiting on you? Talk about entitled.”
I quickly lowered my head, forcing a weak smile. “Sorry, the traffic on the I-95 was brutal.”
She cut me off mid-sentence. “Consider your bonus for this month revoked.”
I clenched my fists and gritted my teeth, but ultimately, I forced out an apology.
Just yesterday, this woman was politely calling me "Ms. Chambers." Now, our roles were completely reversed. If I messed this up, not only would the bonus be gone, but the job itself was on the line. And for all its ridiculous demands, this was the best-paying, best-benefit gig in the city. I wasn’t ready to let it go.
Seeing my compliance, Sasha gave a satisfied smirk. “Since everyone is finally here, let’s go over the new rules.”
The colleagues around me visibly tensed, their faces pale.
Harper tugged on my sleeve, whispering just loud enough for me to hear. “Her rules… they’re insane.”
“Listen up, everyone,” Sasha declared, her voice booming. “I am an expectant mother, and this is the future heir to Blake Carrington’s empire.” She dramatically patted her stomach.
“Rule Number One: Lunch is canceled. No one eats in the building, period.”
A collective gasp went around the room. I couldn’t stop myself from interjecting. “Sasha, everyone works incredibly hard. If we don’t eat—”
I was instantly drenched. A full cup of scalding, fresh-brewed coffee was thrown in my face.
“Who the hell are you to use my first name?” she spat. “From now on, you will address me as ‘Mrs. Carrington!’”
The pain made my vision swim, and my body shook involuntarily. Sasha scoffed, pointing a finger at me.
“Let this be a lesson to all of you. This is what happens when you cross me.”
The sight of my burning skin terrified the rest of the staff into absolute silence.
“Rule Number Two!” she shouted, puffing out her chest. “You are all here to serve me. If I tell you to go east, you do not even look west.”
“Rule Number Three! All AC units must be off. The outside noise gives me migraines.”
This time, no one dared to argue—not even me. I could already see a painful, angry red splotch forming on my forearm where the coffee had landed.
“Did you hear me?” she demanded. “If you can’t manage it, you can all get out!” She shot me one final, warning glare.
My colleagues rapidly nodded their heads, promising compliance.
After she dismissed everyone, she kept me back.

“I hear you’re my fiancé’s executive assistant?”
I managed a strained smile. “I mostly just organize Mr. Carrington’s files and handle logistics.”
My answer clearly didn't satisfy her. “Start by massaging my shoulders.”
I went behind the sofa. “Is this pressure okay?”
She lay back, eyes closed. “Look, I don’t want to be difficult, but Blake told me I have to assert myself now. If I don’t lay down the law with you working types, I’ll never have any authority.”
She smirked. “But you wouldn’t dare object, would you? You all need this job to survive. And honestly, my requests aren't that bad.”
She snapped her eyes open. “Are they excessive?”
I immediately shook my head, my face plastered with a fake grin. “Not at all, Mrs. Carrington. Perfectly reasonable.”
Watching her tyrannical behavior, I had to seriously question Blake’s taste in women. Had years of high-stakes corporate life finally made him desperate enough to date… this?
The rest of the morning was spent running errands like a personal valet. She demanded a fresh cup of coffee, then threw the porcelain mug across the room in disgust.
“How did you ever get this job?” she yelled. “I asked for lukewarm! Don’t you know the difference?”
I barely registered her complaints because the coffee had splattered all over Blake’s mahogany desk, soaking the critical documents laid out on top.
My heart sank. “Mrs. Carrington, those are the Chandler Group merger contracts. They’re due in two days.” Even with my quick reflexes, the high-value paperwork was now stained a mottled brown.
Sasha glanced at the mess, her tone utterly detached. “It’s just paper. Nothing is more valuable than the health of the baby in my womb.”
She suddenly shouted at me, her eyes blazing. “You are to focus entirely on me, do you understand? You’re not even a good servant!”
Stifling a wave of furious indignation, I asked, my voice slightly shaky, “Mrs. Carrington, that contract is genuinely important. Can I please take it out now to see if I can salvage the signatures?”
She eventually agreed.
But just as my hand reached the doorknob, she called me back. “Find two of the girls. I need a foot and leg rub.”
I bit down hard on my lip. “Understood.”
Stepping out, I was hit by the oppressive reality of the no-AC rule. The entire floor was a furnace. Every employee, supposedly hard at work, was frantically fanning themselves with notebooks and files.
I froze, looking at the central AC unit—it wasn’t just off, someone had even unplugged and removed the power cord. My colleagues looked at me with desperate, pleading eyes.
Before I could speak, Sasha emerged, clutching her belly.
“Stop that right now!”
Her cold gaze swept over us. “I told you I can’t have the noise of the AC unit. So, you’ve decided to make noise with your own petty flapping? Are you trying to deliberately provoke me?”
Every single person immediately dropped their makeshift fans, their faces flushed with shame and heat.
“You have succeeded in annoying me greatly!”

Sasha looked at me, a sneer on her face. “How did you ever become an executive assistant, Ariel? You clearly have zero management skills.”
As I prepared to defend myself, she raised her hand and pointed to a handful of my sweat-drenched colleagues, singling them out.
“You, you, and you. Stand up.”
“Begin. Two hundred squats, right now!”
“Excuse me?” The named colleague, a man named Eric, looked shocked, but tried to remain respectful. “Mrs. Carrington, we—”
“Make that three hundred!”
Seeing Sasha immediately escalate the punishment, they shut their mouths and started squatting.
She clapped her hands and turned to me. “They’re being punished because their excessive fanning created noise. That’s your fault.” I looked at the employees, their faces streaming with sweat, groaning in misery as they worked out in the unbearable heat.
“And now, you will do five hundred squats!”
I pointed at myself, disbelief coloring my voice. “Me?”
She scoffed. “Yes, you. You failed to manage the situation. You bear the most responsibility.” She suddenly narrowed her eyes. “Get started. Now.”
I didn’t dare hesitate. I clasped my hands behind my head and dropped into a squat.
She leisurely addressed the other employees. “Are you hot? Do you all feel so incredibly hot?”
“Funny, I don’t feel hot at all.”
My inner monologue screamed. Of course, you don’t feel hot! You were just lying on a silk-covered sofa in a climate-controlled office! But the words stayed trapped behind my clenched teeth.
Sasha pulled a chair from the conference table and sat down, watching me struggle. “My baby—Blake’s future heir—is hungry!”
She drummed her fingers on the chair arm. “What should we eat? Let’s see. I need that organic, hand-pressed green juice from the West Village. And a dozen Artisan Tiramisu bites from the French Patisserie downtown.”
She patted my shoulder. “Tough job, Ariel, but my baby wants what it wants.” She then slowly sauntered back into the office.
The second the door closed, everyone let out a collective sigh of relief.
But she instantly yanked the door open, sticking her head out. “Bring me two girls to rub my legs.” She reconsidered. “No, make it four. Gotta get the feet, too.”
The door slammed shut.
My colleagues looked at me with miserable expressions. “Ariel… what do we do?”
One of the squatting employees was openly crying. “I have a project due to the client at 8 p.m. this evening. I haven’t saved anything yet. What are we going to do?”
I gasped for air, checking my watch. Blake was still on the plane—calling him was impossible.
“Just hold on, everyone! Blake lands at four o’clock! I’m going to tell him everything!”
Right now, I was the biggest victim, and I was going to make sure he knew it.

After five hundred squats, I felt like I had lost half my body weight. I had to brace myself against a desk to keep from collapsing.
But Sasha’s demands were a clear threat, and I couldn't risk further delay. I stumbled out, my clothes drenched, and headed for the garage.
I drove like a maniac, cursing Sasha out loud, and adding a few choice words for Blake as well.
When I finally returned with the expensive, bespoke items, a new set of employees was inside her office being forced into servitude.
I carefully set the food in front of her. She pouted, her voice strangely soft. “You look exhausted, Ariel. That was a lot of running around.” She patted the sofa beside her. “Sit down.”
The sudden kindness made a knot form in my stomach.
The instant I sat, Sasha grabbed the juice bottle and dumped the entire contents over my head. Before I could react, she upended the tiramisu container, letting the mushy, chocolatey cream slide down my face and suit.
I shot to my feet. “What the hell are you doing?”
She glared at me, her face venomous. “And you are supposed to be my fiancé’s assistant? Didn’t anyone tell you to handle a pregnant woman’s food with extreme care?”
“This juice is lukewarm! It’s garbage! Even a dog wouldn’t touch it!” She hurled the empty container at me. “Go buy me new ones. Now!”
My body was a disgusting mix of sweat, hot coffee, and now, spoiled gourmet dessert.
When I didn't move, her brow furrowed. “Are you deaf? I asked you a question. Do I need to fire you for you to understand?”
I squeezed my hands into tight fists, quickly wiping the sludge from my face. I scooped up a handful of the ruined tiramisu from the floor, marched up to her, grabbed her jaw, and smeared the mess across her face and into her mouth.
“You know what? I quit, you psycho!”
The satisfaction was immediate and total.
Sasha sputtered, choking on the cream. She shoved her hands against the sofa, gagging. Strands of juice-soaked hair stuck to her face, and a glob of cream was actually forced out of her nose.
“You! You’re going to regret this! I’m going to have my husband ruin your life!”
I adjusted my collar. “I’ll be waiting.” I spun on my heel and left the office.
Harper ran up to me, her eyes widening in horror at my appearance. She started picking bits of dessert off my jacket, tears welling up as she pointed to Riley.
“Riley’s stomach ulcer just burst. She’s throwing up blood.”
I was stunned. “Why didn’t you call an ambulance?”
Harper broke down completely. “Sasha wouldn’t let us! She said losing an employee would affect the company’s efficiency!”
I rushed to Riley. Her face was ashen, her hair plastered to her forehead. She was curled into a small, tight ball.
“Ariel, I’m so sorry…”
“Hospital. Now.”
Harper and I quickly helped her up, and several other colleagues rushed over to assist.
After getting Riley settled in the ambulance, I drove back to the office.
The place was a total disaster. The break room had been completely trashed, the microwave smashed into pieces. Harper told me Sasha was currently using Blake’s private shower in his office suite. She was probably getting ready for the next round of retribution.
I checked my phone. 4:30 p.m. Blake had landed.
Fire me? Not a chance. I’m doing it first.
I called him, fury burning through my veins.
“What the hell kind of woman did you pick up? Are you blind?”
“Get your spoiled princess home! Sasha Bell is a menace who will drive your company into bankruptcy! You’ll be lucky to have a door left to close! And by the way, I QUIT!”
There was a long silence on the line. I thought the connection had dropped.
Finally, Blake shouted. “Ariel Chambers, are you losing your mind? Stop with the insane talk!”
“I told you, I am not dating anyone! What do you mean, my girlfriend?!”
