After graduating from medical school, I broke up with James.

"Just because I went to her medical lecture instead of your graduation ceremony?" He smirked sarcastically.

I nodded silently.

"You really never grow up, do you?" He laughed coldly. "Fine, have it your way. But don't come crawling back to me later."

From age twelve to twenty-five, I had always been chasing after him, so insecure that everyone thought I couldn't live without him.

But this time, I was truly exhausted.

He didn't know that I had already applied to study abroad.

In a country far, far away from him.

From now on, no one would stop him from doing things for his sister-in-law anymore.

"I went to Megan's medical lecture," James explained coldly.

Megan was his sister-in-law.

She once said, "We're all the same age, don't call me sister-in-law. It makes me feel old."

So James started calling her "Megan" without hesitation.

"I know," I bit my lip.

"You know and you're still angry?" He sounded exasperated. "Can you stop acting like a child?"

"James," I clenched my fingers, gathering the courage to look him in the eye, "Let's break up!"

James leaned back in his office chair, looking at me coldly: "Just because I didn't go to your graduation ceremony?"

I nodded silently.

"You really want to break up?" he asked.

"Yes."

"Sophia."

"Hmm."

"I don't have the patience to play this 'on-again-off-again' game with you. Adults should think carefully before they speak."

"Hmm."

"You really never grow up, do you?" He laughed coldly. "Fine, have it your way. But don't come crawling back to me later."

I nodded: "Don't worry, I won't!"

As I turned to leave, I ran into Megan coming through the door.

"James, want to grab dinner? I have a question..."

Megan looked surprised to see me: "Sophia, what are you doing here?"

She glanced between James and me.

"Did you two have a fight?"

"Is it because James didn't go to your graduation ceremony?" she asked me.

Then she explained: "Sophia, don't misunderstand! This was my first time giving a medical lecture, it was really important to me, so I asked James to stay and help me prepare. I didn't think it would take so long and make him miss your graduation. I'm so sorry!"

Her words were flawless, making me look childish in comparison.

This was what I hated most about her.

Seeing my silence, she linked her arm with mine: "Come on! Have dinner with us."

She teased James: "Your girlfriend's here, let's not eat at the cafeteria today! Let's get sushi! I haven't had it in ages. James, you're treating!"

Then she covered her mouth and laughed: "Oh, I forgot, you always treat."

She turned to me: "Sophia, I heard from James that you like sushi too, right?"

I froze, glaring at James: "Really? I don't remember that."

Megan frowned slightly: "Oh, maybe I remembered wrong. But no worries, just tell us what you want to eat. Don't be shy!"

She was treating me like a complete outsider.

James didn't seem to notice anything wrong, and just stood up, calmly taking off his lab coat: "Let's go. Sushi it is."

I pulled my arm away from Megan: "You two go ahead. I'm going home."

Then I fled.

As I left, I heard James say calmly: "Just ignore her. She's being childish. It's time she grew up a bit."
