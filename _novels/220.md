Before I agreed to marry my husband, I was aware he had a childhood sweetheart. Their relationship had ended badly, beyond repair. I was pregnant and preparing confidently for our wedding when, unexpectedly, his first love lost her memory and reverted to the innocent 16-year-old she once was. My husband asked me to be understanding, to treat her like a patient. If she wanted my jewelry, makeup, or clothes, I should give them to her. If she wanted to stay in our home, she could.
