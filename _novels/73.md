I'm married to a brilliant pharmaceutical scientist.

After our marriage, we were deeply in love, and everyone envied me for having a wife who was both devoted to the family and successful in her career. I believed our marriage was perfect and couldn't resist showing off my wife to the world. But one day, I overheard her talking to a student at the lab entrance.

"Jude and Finn have the most similar physical conditions. I've spent years researching. If I don't deceive him into letting Finn test the drug, and Finn gets hurt, how could I live with myself?"

It turns out, the drugs I tested for her were all for nothing...

If that's the case, anyone who wants to be the test subject can go ahead!
