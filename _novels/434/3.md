My heart went completely cold. I let out a cold laugh and returned Marcus's slap, shouting back without backing down: "Ethan is lying under that white sheet right now. You can look and see for yourself whether it's true or false. What's the point of me lying to you?"

"Go lift it and see! See clearly why your son died with his eyes wide open!"

When I touched Ethan's phone in my pocket, I was already absolutely certain that Chloe was lying again.

But I knew that Marcus would definitely believe Chloe's words.

Just as he would undoubtedly refute me without hesitation.

But this time Marcus hesitated. Instead, it was Chloe who came over, pretending to be sorrowful: "Olivia, is... is that really Ethan's body?"

"Then it's even more important for Marcus to take a good look. Such a good child, how could he have died..."

Others might not have noticed, but I clearly knew that Chloe's words were dripping with mockery.

The next moment, before I could even react, Chloe directly lifted the white sheet covering my son.

And then, I was stunned!

Under the white sheet was clearly an old man in his eighties.

I quickly rolled my wheelchair to the bedside, looking in disbelief at this withered corpse.

This person isn't Ethan? Then where is Ethan?

It must be Chloe's doing!

Thinking of this, I raised my eyes to stare at Chloe, shouting furiously: "Where's Ethan? Where have you hidden my son?!"

Chloe's slightly raised chin, the smugness in her eyes about to overflow. But her tone was full of feigned panic: "O-Olivia, what are you saying? Didn't I just hear you say Ethan was dead and want to take one last look at him? How can you accuse me of hiding Ethan?"

Before I could argue with her, Marcus's hand slapped me across the face again.

The crowd turned to look, and he seemed to be struggling to suppress his anger: "Olivia, your acting skills have really improved. If it weren't for Chloe, I might have really been fooled by you!"

"Now that you've been exposed, you're using Chloe as a scapegoat. It seems I've been too lenient with you..."

But I had no time to care about Marcus. My mind was full of thoughts about where Ethan could be. Seeing the increasingly thick smile on Chloe's face, the anger in my heart could no longer be suppressed. I raised my fist and struck Chloe in the abdomen.

She fell to the ground in pain. I rolled directly off my wheelchair, tightly gripping Chloe's neck.

"Speak! Where have you hidden Ethan? Where is my son's body?!"

Marcus shouted and was about to pull me away, but this time I didn't let him succeed.

Chloe's face turned from red to purple. It seemed the near-death experience made her panic. She kept patting my hand, and finally managed to squeeze out three weak words from her throat: "Gar... bage... room"

In an instant, I released my hand, ignoring Chloe who had started gasping for air. I struggled to get back into my wheelchair to go find Ethan.

But Marcus kicked my wheelchair aside, then crouched down and grabbed my hair, slamming my head against the ground again and again, ignoring the blood flowing from my forehead. He said viciously: "I've really been too lenient with you! You still want to kill Chloe? Why don't you go die yourself!"

I endured the pain and accused: "Chloe has confessed... Ethan is in the garbage room..."

"Bullshit! How could she say anything when you were choking her?!"

Marcus interrupted me mercilessly. Then, as if still not satisfied, he put his hands on my neck and started squeezing.

"Come on! Speak to me! Say one word and I'll believe you!"

The pressure on his hands gradually increased, and my breathing became labored. I struggled to say something, but couldn't squeeze out a single word.

As my consciousness began to fade and everything around me became unclear, just when I felt I was about to be choked to death, in that last moment.

A scream suddenly came from not far away: "Ah— Ghost!"

The pressure on my throat instantly loosened.

When my vision cleared, I only saw Marcus stumbling through the crowd, his face pale as he rushed into the open garbage room nearby.

And what followed was his heart-wrenching wail: "Ethan——!!"
