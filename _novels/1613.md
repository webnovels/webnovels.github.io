I rushed home at 3 AM.

The moment water sprayed from the showerhead, I knew the temperature was wrong.

My husband, Captain Lucas Thomas, was an instructor at the military academy. He was strong, fit, and always took cold showers.

But today, the water was hot.

"Finally decided to warm things up for me?" I asked him.

He paused, then gave a playful salute. "Copy that, ma'am. Won't forget again."

I smiled. As I stepped toward the shower, I saw two overlapping handprints on the glass door.

On the floor lay a strand of dark, glossy hair. It was not mine.

It was obvious. My husband was cheating. And he had brought her into our bathroom for...sex!

I fought back nausea and sent a photo to my cousin Brooke at the academy.

"Dark hair. Around five three. Find her. Fifty grand."

She replied instantly.

"I'll drag that bitch out myself!"


Staring at those overlapping handprints, I could almost see them there.

For five years of marriage, Lucas Thomas had been perfect.

He came from a military family, was charming, and treated me like his only mission.

No matter what, I never thought it would come to this.

My phone chimed softly.

checked it almost without thinking.

It was a photo from my cousin, Brooke.
Lucas stood surrounded by students, a girl crouched in front of him.
She was petite, with long hair, a youthful face, and wide, round eyes. Even through the grainy photo, her radiant youth was unmistakable.
She was smiling, head tilted, gazing up at Lucas with open adoration.
I took a sharp breath, but the air was cold as needles, piercing my lungs and making my chest burn.
Brooke's messages kept coming.

"That's Summer Hayes. A senior in the Medical School's surgery program. She's in Lucas's class this semester."

"Disgusting. Just goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover."

I swiftly transferred the money to her.

"Don't do anything reckless. I'll handle this myself."

By the time Lucas woke up, I had already composed my expression.

He looked at the dark circles under my eyes, his face full of concern.

"Didn't sleep well last night?"

How I wanted to just blurt out Summer's name. But in the end, I just gave a slight smile.

"No, jet lag's hitting me hard."

Lucas gently pushed me back onto the bed and pressed a kiss on my forehead.

"I shouldn't have bothered you last night. Get some more sleep; I'll call you when breakfast is ready."

Still the perfect Lucas Thomas.

It wasn't until we were sitting at the dining table that his hurried movements made me pause, and I couldn't help but ask.

"Don't you have the day off today?"

"There's a drill at the medical department. I need to oversee it."

Lucas quickly finished his breakfast and stood up to leave.

But I spoke softly.

"Are you forgetting what day it is?"

He froze, glanced at the date, and immediately looked remorseful.

"I forgot, Ava. I'm so sorry, we said I'd go with you to visit your father's grave."

"But the medical department drill was scheduled a long time ago..."

A cold laugh echoed in my heart.

"You go. I actually want to talk to my dad alone today anyway."

Lucas immediately rushed off to the academy.

After quickly visiting the cemetery, I coincidentally arrived as the medical department was conducting a first-aid drill on the sports field.

Lucas blew a whistle.

"Alright, everyone, find a partner and practice your first-aid techniques."

Students quickly paired up, but one girl was left standing alone in the center.

Teasing shouts rose from around them.

"Instructor, who's gonna give Summer CPR?"

"Who else? If it were anyone else, wouldn't the Instructor absolutely lose it?!"

Amidst the laughter, Summer made a face at her classmates.

"ou're all perverts! My conscience is clear, I have nothing to hide!"

"It was just a trauma assessment drill! Totally innocent, okay?!"

Lucas cleared his throat.

"Alright, alright, it's just a demonstration, don't fuss!"

With that, he gestured for Summer to lie down in front of him.

Then, he actually bent down and kissed her lips!
