The SAT Showdown: They Called Me Wretched

The SATs were just around the corner when they finally brought me home – the real daughter.

On SAT day, I was the first one to hand in my paper and walk out of the exam hall.

A reporter asked how I felt I did, and I frankly told him the questions were super easy.

The reporter gasped, "Are you, by any chance, Ashley Montgomery, the genius academic star?"

Just then, the fake daughter, Ashley, also finished her exam and came out.

My parents, Richard and Eleanor, and my brother, Blake, immediately surrounded her, showering her with affection and declaring that *she* was the real genius.

Ashley pretended to speak up for me, but her words were laced with mockery. "Sister, it's okay if you didn't do well. But you shouldn't lie, you know? I heard your scores are barely enough to get into a community college. You can always retake them!"

My parents and Blake glared at me, their faces dark, as if I had brought shame upon them.

I just crossed my arms and smiled confidently.

I was the first person to walk out of every single SAT subject test.

When I confidently declared that Harvard was a sure thing after the last exam, the live stream chat absolutely exploded.

My mother, Eleanor, was so furious she practically shrieked, "We don't have such a delusional daughter!"

My father, Richard, proclaimed, "If she can get into Harvard, I'll give her my entire fortune!"

People in the live stream had already dug up my previous scores, frantically spamming the chat: "If she gets into Harvard – no, even just undergrad – I'll eat my own socks on live stream!"

I looked at my father and shook my head. "Dad, your fortune? I wouldn't even touch it!"
