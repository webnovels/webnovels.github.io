I bought a custom $2 million Ferrari as a weekend toy. My wife gave it to her male assistant as a "gift."

The assistant, Liam, posted a photo on Instagram to brag:

"Finally put a saddle on this wild Mustang. From now on, everywhere it runs, it stays within the circles I draw~"

My secretary sent me the screenshot.

In the photo, my custom beige interior had been ripped out and replaced with cheap, black punk-rock leather.

Worse, my passenger seat looked like a literal dog kennel, piled with his trash.

I texted my wife, Elena, demanding an answer. She left me on read.

Five hours later, I posted a video on all my social media platforms.

Caption: "My $50 million garage is so spacious. It’s perfect for the animals I’m raising to run free~"

In the video, a wrecking ball I hired was smashing Elena’s private luxury showroom to pieces, converting it into a stable for horses.

Chapter 1

Five minutes after I hit post, my mother-in-law called.

As soon as I picked up, her shrieking voice pierced my eardrum.

"Caleb Sterling! That video! Did you just turn Elena's showroom into a barn?!"

At the same time, a notification popped up. My video had gone viral, hitting millions of views.

I felt zero guilt. I answered calmly.

"That's right. I turned your daughter's garage into a stable."

"Mom, you have great eyesight."

There was a silence on the other end, so I pulled the phone away from my ear.

Predictably, the explosion followed.

"Are you insane?! You wasteful loser!"

"You are embarrassing our family in front of the entire social circle!"

"Delete that video immediately and fix that garage!"

When she finally paused to breathe, I forwarded her the screenshot of Liam’s Instagram post.

I spoke slowly and clearly:

"Your daughter gave my property to a wild horse on the side. Why can't I renovate her garage to match?"

"Mom, she touched my things first. It’s only fair I touch her garage."

I thought seeing the evidence might make my mother-in-law pause.

I was wrong. After a brief silence, she defended her daughter with audacious confidence.

"Elena is a CEO! She has to socialize and flirt a little for business. It’s part of the job!"

"You’re her husband. Why can’t you be more open-minded?"

I laughed out loud.

I knew she favored her daughter, but this double standard was impressive.

"Mom, since you're so open-minded, I’m sure you wouldn't mind if I found a few young sugar babies for Dad."

"I bet Dad wouldn't refuse."

"You’re getting older. You should be sensible and find someone to keep his bed warm."

She choked on her words. It took her a full minute to recover before screaming again.

"You dare! You speak to me like that? You are a psychopath!"

"Elena has bad luck to be married to a man like you!"

"If you dare try anything with your father, I won’t let you off the hook!"

She hung up immediately, terrified I’d say something even worse.

People like her are always blind when it’s their own fault.

But when the tables turn, suddenly they care about morals.

To be fair, this marriage was a charity case from the start.

Five years ago, the Vance family business was collapsing.

Elena's father used an old favor he owed my family to beg my father for help.

My dad is soft-hearted. He showed me Elena's photo.

I looked at her innocent face and, like a fool, I agreed.

After the wedding, I used the Sterling family’s massive resources to quietly fill the Vance Corporation's debt holes.

In three years, I took their failing company public.

Back then, my mother-in-law praised me daily. Now? She treats me like a servant.

And Elena, who used to respect me, now gives my things to other men.

It seems the Vance family has forgotten who feeds them.

The Sterling family's power is something they can't even comprehend.

Since they want to play games, I don’t mind taking back every scrap of glory I gave them.

Chapter 2

Half an hour passed. Still no reply from Elena.

I was about to call her when my secretary sent me another update.

"Mr. Sterling, the CEO took her assistant to the Diamond Gala."

"Rumors are spreading that the assistant is her new boyfriend."

Attached was a photo. Elena was wearing a couture gown, laughing with the elite.

Next to her stood Liam, wearing a bespoke suit and a watch worth a million dollars.

He stood close to her, acting like the master of the house.

I gripped my phone until my knuckles turned white.

The Diamond Gala. A high-barrier event hosted by the city's oldest money.

Usually, I, Caleb Sterling, would be the one by her side.

Instead, she took a glorified secretary.

Elena, you really have a death wish.

A wave of rage hit me. I made a decision instantly.

I called the estate manager.

"Go to the stables. Saddle a horse. I'm going to the gala."

The manager paused.

"Sir... did you say prepare the car or the horse?"

"The horse. I'm riding there."

Ten minutes later, I was on a thoroughbred stallion, galloping toward the city center.

When I arrived at the venue, I didn't dismount. I rode right through the open gates.

Recognizing me as the Sterling heir, no security guard dared to stop me.

I guided the horse right onto the outdoor terrace of the party.

I spotted them immediately. Elena and Liam, giggling together.

I pulled the reins.

The horse let out a loud whinny, silencing the crowd.

Elena looked up. Her smile froze.

She stared, processing the fact that her husband was sitting on a horse in the middle of a cocktail party.

She marched over, frowning deeply.

"Why are you here? And on a horse? Are you crazy?"

She grabbed the reins, trying to pull the horse away. The beast didn't budge.

I looked down at her from the saddle, smiling coldly.

"What? You're at a party. Shouldn't your husband be here?"

"I didn't see a 'No Horses' sign."

She let go of the reins but hissed a warning.

"I am here to discuss business. Don't embarrass me."

I laughed loudly, making sure everyone heard.

"Business? Is that why you're practically sitting in your assistant's lap?"

"Is the business discussion about which hotel room you're going to later?"

The crowd gasped. Whispers erupted immediately.

Elena’s face turned purple.

"Stop spouting nonsense! We are communicating normally!"

Liam looked terrified.

"Mr. Sterling, Ms. Vance and I are innocent. Nothing happened."

"Innocent..."

I rolled the word around in my mouth.

"Fine. Let's pretend you're innocent."

I dismounted smoothly and tossed the reins toward Liam.

"Then, Assistant Liam, take my horse to the stables. Feed him well."

"This horse cost me a fortune. Don't treat him poorly."

Liam froze, looking at Elena for help.

Suddenly, a friend of mine from the old money circle stepped out of the crowd.

"Caleb! You rode a horse here? That's legendary!"

"Is that an Akhal-Teke?"

Chapter 3

I smiled at my friend, Ryan.

"Good eye. If you like him, I'll send you one. I converted a garage into a stable, plenty of stock."

After a brief chat, I turned to address the entire party.

"If anyone is interested, feel free to visit my new stables. Pick a horse, it’s on me."

The crowd cheered.

"Mr. Sterling is generous!"

"I saw the video of the renovation! Very avant-garde!"

I smiled, then glanced at Liam.

"Some animals are just too wild," I said, my voice dropping.

"You have to give them space to run, or they start coveting things that don't belong to them."

"But in the end, a beast is just a toy to be ridden and tamed."

I locked eyes with Liam.

"Right, Assistant Liam?"

"I... I don't understand," Liam stammered, hiding behind Elena.

Elena was confused.

"What stables? When did we build a stable?"

A guest chimed in, laughing. "Ms. Vance, your husband smashed your luxury garage and turned it into a horse ranch! It's trending #1 on Twitter!"

He showed her the video.

Elena’s face went from confused to horrified.

She whipped around to face me.

"You smashed my garage?!"

I smiled brightly.

"Yep. Are you happy? We can ride horses together now."

"Caleb! Sterling!"

She gritted her teeth.

"Are you out of your mind?!"

"That garage cost me $40 million and took two years to build!"

"And you smashed it without asking me?!"

"I'm not crazy," I said, my smile vanishing.

"You gave my car to another man without asking. Why can't I smash your garage?"

"I'm just learning from you, Elena. Don't have double standards."

Elena finally understood what this was about.

"The... car?"

"I gave it to him as a reward for his performance! He worked hard!"

"You have so many cars. Why does it matter if I give one to a subordinate?"

"If you're that stingy, I'll buy you ten more."

"Restore my garage immediately. We'll talk about this at home. Stop making a scene."

She tried to grab my arm to drag me away.

I shook her off.

"I'm not leaving."

"You're acting so guilty. Are you actually keeping him as a pet?"

The crowd whispered louder.

"I told you, it was a work reward! We are clean!"

Seeing her arrogance, I lost the last shred of patience.

I reached into the saddlebag and pulled out the diamond necklace I had just bought at auction for her—worth $2 million.

I smashed it onto the pavement.

Crunch.

Diamonds scattered everywhere.

"First you give my car to him. Now you parade him around as your partner."

"Elena, you have some nerve."

"I'm warning you. If you touch my things again, or let this trash appear in front of me..."

"You won't just lose a garage."

"I have the power to raise the Vance family up, and I have the power to wipe the name Vance off the map."

I turned around and walked out, leaving the stunned crowd behind.

Chapter 4

We entered a cold war.

Elena didn't come home. I didn't call her.

While organizing my desk, I found a supplementary credit card Elena had given me when we got married.

She had been depositing money into it for years—a "allowance" to soothe her ego. It had about $15 million on it.

I never touched it. I thought of it as emergency funds for her company.

But thinking about the money she spent on Liam, I realized I was an idiot.

I took the card and went straight to the mall.

I was going to spend every cent.

I shopped for hours. When the cashier rang up a mountain of luxury goods, she paused.

"I'm sorry, Mr. Sterling. This card has been declined. It's frozen."

"Frozen?"

"Yes, the primary holder locked it three days ago."

Three days ago?

While I thought she was reflecting on her actions, she was busy cutting off my funds?

I tried to call her. Blocked.

Just then, my secretary texted me a screenshot.

It was a new post from Liam.

Caption: "Promoted to Chief of Staff! Thank you, Ms. Vance, for the trust. I won't let you down~"

Image: A photo of the top-floor corner office—the best view in the building.

Another text followed:

"Sir, she didn't just promote him."

"Yesterday, she bought him a villa in the city center. Paid in full."

I laughed in disbelief.

She ignored my warning. She doubled down.

Frozen my card, but bought him a house and gave him a promotion?

Elena, you really have a death wish.

Since you want to play hardball, don't blame me for breaking the board.
