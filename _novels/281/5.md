I returned home to pack up Leo's toys and clothes.

With each item I packed, my heart was pierced by a sharp needle.

Leo's favorite toy plane still had his messy, childish handwriting on it.

His neatly arranged picture books still held his innocent scribbles, with "I love Mommy" written inside.

My tears fell onto the floor, my hands trembling uncontrollably, as if I saw my son running towards me.

I reached out to embrace him, but only grasped empty air.

I finished packing. As I passed by the walk-in closet, I suddenly vomited a mouthful of blood.

The opened closet was covered in scratch marks, bloody streaks everywhere. Small, chaotic bloody handprints were slapped all over the closet door. It wasn't hard to imagine what had happened inside.

I walked closer, step by step, gently tracing the marks on the cabinet. Then, I took photos and videos for evidence.

I don't know what state of mind I was in when I did all this. I only snapped back to reality when I stood at the main gate, watching the moving truck pull up.

Just then, Julian finally returned.

His private jet landed on the tarmac, and as he stepped off, he saw Mr. and Mrs. Davies standing there, their faces grim.

Behind him, Brittany Miller's face lit up with a triumphant smile. She stroked her belly, then linked arms with Julian.

Julian frowned, looking at his parents' somber faces.

"Mom, Dad, what are you doing here? Where are Scarlett and Leo?"

Mr. Davies snatched a cane from nearby and lashed out at Julian.

"You have the nerve to mention Leo!"

"How could I have a son as beastly as you?! You killed our child, and you still have the audacity to parade around with your mistress!"

Julian instinctively shielded Brittany beside him, complaining,

"I just locked him up for a bit. I was about to tell my assistant to let him out. Is it really necessary to react like this?"

Mr. Davies clutched his chest, his eyes filled with profound disappointment.

"Don't you know?! I personally saw Leo's body sent for autopsy! The medical examiner said the child suffered extreme pain and struggled fiercely before he died!"

Julian's face turned ashen. He mumbled in disbelief,

"How could this be? I just wanted to punish him a little. Mom, Dad, you must be lying to me, right?!"

He saw the sorrow on his parents' faces, and a wave of unease flooded his heart.

Brittany, seeing Julian's shift in demeanor, immediately looked distressed. She tightened her grip on Julian's arm.

"Julian, honey…"

Before she could finish, Julian forcefully shook her off and rushed into the house.

There, in the center of the living room, was a black and white photo of Leo…


The lawyer, standing nearby, placed the divorce agreement in front of Julian. His hands trembled as he flipped through the papers.

The last page of the agreement bore my tear-stained signature.
