Three days later, I dressed casually and arrived alone at the banquet venue.

The moment Sophia saw me, her eyes lit up, and a smug smile played on her lips.

"You said you wouldn't come, but your actions speak louder than words."

"But if you want to win me back, you need to at least please me. For an occasion like this, you must dress appropriately to match my status."

I ignored her sudden bout of narcissism and tried to walk past her to my seat.

After just a couple of steps, an irritated Sophia grabbed me.

"Jack, I'm talking to you. Are you listening?"

"Our seats are here. Where are you going?"

I shook off her hand and calmly said:

"That's your seat. My seat is over there."

Following my gaze, Sophia looked towards the main table, her face turning extremely unpleasant.

Lucas shot me a venomous look and pointed at my watch, shouting:

"Jack, how did you sneak in here? Are you here to cause trouble? How... how dare you wear that watch?"

His voice was loud, immediately attracting everyone's attention.

"Isn't that watch the 'True Love Eternal' that CEO Gu bought for her husband at a high price? Today is the first time CEO Gu is appearing with her husband. How dare you?"

"Did you sneak in? Are you trying to embarrass us in front of CEO Gu?"

"Ms. Song, is this your friend?"

Seeing that I hadn't even glanced at her, Sophia tightened her sleeves and said calmly:

"No."

Hearing Sophia's words, Lucas's expression brightened, and he looked at me haughtily:

"Take off the watch and get out!"

I looked at him with amusement and sneered:

"Are you sure you want me to leave?"

Lucas lost face and his eyes turned vicious as he shouted:

"Stop pretending! Take off the watch now!"

As he said this, he reached out to grab my wrist.

I pushed away his approaching hand, stepping back to avoid him.

Unexpectedly, someone tripped me from behind.

I was stunned by the sudden fall.

Lucas stepped on my hand and forcibly yanked the watch off my wrist.

"This piece of trash, and you treat it like a treasure."

My arm ached from being stepped on, and my wrist was raw and bleeding.

Yet I could only stare blankly at the now broken watch.

"Pick him up and throw him out!" Lucas commanded arrogantly.

People immediately surrounded me. Seeing them about to grab my arms and legs, I struggled and hurriedly said:

"Stop! I'm Amelia's..."

"Slap!"

Before I could finish, Lucas slapped me across the face.

"Are you going to spread rumors about being CEO Gu's lover again? You're not worthy!"

Not satisfied, Lucas backhanded me with another slap.

I hadn't planned to settle scores with him on this trip back.

Because there was no need.

But now, I will definitely make him pay.

Sophia crouched in front of me, trying to touch the wound on my wrist, but I instinctively recoiled.

She looked at me coldly:

"Jack, have you had enough?"

"You came here today wearing that watch and dressed like this just because you saw I've become successful and can't let me go, right? You want to make me jealous?"

"If you beg me, I'll agree to take you back."

I let out a cold laugh and looked at her, saying:

"Sophia, you're finished!"

Sophia frowned, about to speak, when she noticed the venue had suddenly grown quiet.

The guests at the banquet began tidying themselves up and moving towards the main entrance.

Sophia quickly pulled me up and whispered:

"CEO Gu is here. Behave yourself!"

"Don't worry, Lucas and I are already divorced."

How absurd.

I rubbed my hand that was nearly broken from being stepped on, feeling nothing but disgust for the woman in front of me.

What does it matter to me whether you're divorced or not?

At that moment, Amelia entered, carrying our daughter, surrounded by a crowd of admirers.

Once in the hall, our daughter fussed to be put down from the woman's arms.
