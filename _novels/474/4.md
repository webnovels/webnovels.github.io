Ignoring Sophia's face, which had turned the color of pig liver, I turned to leave.

But before I could take a few steps, Sophia grabbed me and coldly questioned:

"Jack, you won't even take my money? What do you mean? I'm a stranger?"

I replied: "Since we've broken up, it's better not to have any contact. It might lead to misunderstandings."

I thought of my slightly jealous wife.

Sophia, however, glanced at Lucas with a knowing look.

"The company is hosting a banquet for CEO Gu in three days. I was planning to bring you along to broaden your horizons."

"But you'll need to buy some proper clothes, so you don't embarrass yourself..."

Before she could finish, I directly declined:

"Really, there's no need. Thank you."

Hearing my rejection again, Sophia became somewhat annoyed.

Her hand, still holding out the check to me, froze in mid-air, her teeth audibly grinding.

"Jack, you've really grown some backbone. I guess it's true that poverty breeds insolence."

"If you don't want to go, then forget it. I'll take Lucas instead!"

Hearing that Sophia wanted to bring him to the banquet, Lucas's eyes lit up, and he quickly said:

"Sophia, I'll definitely perform well. I won't embarrass you at all."

Not wanting to entangle with them any further, I turned and strode away, leaving one last sentence:

"I hope you'll still be this confident three days from now."

Quickly leaving the arrival hall and breathing in the fresh air, the nausea in my stomach finally subsided.

Three years ago, my family had arranged for me to go abroad for a blind date. Defying my parents' pressure, I begged my girlfriend of seven years, Sophia, to marry me, planning to present them with a fait accompli.

Sophia agreed.

But unexpectedly, at the door of the registry office, I not only waited for Sophia but also her longtime crush, Lucas.

"Lucas's child needs to be registered, so I need to marry him first."

"After a month, when we get the divorce certificate, I'll marry you right away."

"It's just for the child, don't overthink it."

Watching Sophia walk into the registry office hand in hand with Lucas, I was completely heartbroken.

That night, I flew abroad for the arranged blind date.

A month later, I held a wedding and married Amelia. A year later, we had our first child.

Recently, Amelia became pregnant with our second child. If it weren't for accompanying Amelia to pay respects to our ancestors, I wouldn't have returned to the country at all.

Let alone run into Sophia.
