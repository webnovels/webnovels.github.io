Suppressing my thoughts, I didn't want to argue with them here. It was pointless.

I looked at Sophia and said calmly, "Weren't you here to pick me up? Let's go."

The scene fell silent for a moment, and then they exchanged glances before bursting into laughter.

Lucas sneered coldly, "Wait for you? Who do you think you are?"

He pointed at the sign, "Look carefully. We're waiting for Helina. Do you know who that is?"

Of course I knew. It was my English name.

"Helina is the husband of the Gu family, the legitimate spouse of CEO Gu," someone explained.

"CEO Gu is a force to be reckoned with in the business world, but she's also quite the romantic. They say she refused to marry for years, just waiting for Helina."

"Everyone in the circle knows that if you want to get on CEO Gu's good side, it's better to please her husband!"

Hearing their chatter, a smile of happiness spread across my face.

In our three years of marriage, Amelia's business had grown exponentially, and her reputation as a doting wife had spread just as far.

Lucas, always trying to one-up me, couldn't resist showing off:

"To win her husband's heart, CEO Gu once bid on a 'True Love Eternal' watch at Christie's, worth 20 million... dollars."

"CEO Gu's husband is the envy of men worldwide."

He paused, then pointed at my wrist and exclaimed, "It's that one!"

The scene suddenly fell silent as everyone looked at my watch.

Sophia abruptly grabbed my hand, examined it for a moment, then said mockingly:

"It's quite an exquisite fake! Which delivery guy bought it for you? Giving a counterfeit as a gift, how trashy."

"Garbage."

I yanked my hand away from her, smirking as I gently caressed the watch.

Seeing my happy expression, Sophia's pupils constricted. She suddenly grabbed my wrist again and roughly wiped the watch.

I hadn't expected this to happen and was caught off guard.

Lucas stepped forward to examine the watch, taking it from Sophia's hand to play with.

"It is indeed more exquisite than the fake I bought, but I'd never wear it out. It'd be embarrassing."

"The counterfeits abroad are really something else. It feels quite nice."

"Or are you saying, Jack, that you're Helina? That you're the legendary husband of CEO Gu?!"

With that, the people around burst into laughter.

After all, it was too absurd for them to believe.

Amelia Gu was a world-renowned financial genius, cold and ruthless in the business world, decisive in her actions.

While just three years ago, I was still hanging out with this group, a loser whose wedding was cancelled by Sophia.

It seemed impossible no matter how you looked at it.

Lucas twirled the watch around his finger.

"Jack, let me have this watch. I'll pay double for it."

Afraid he might drop it, I quickly said, "Give me back the watch. Amelia gave it to me..."

Before I could finish, Sophia slapped me so hard that blood appeared at the corner of my mouth.

"Shut up!"
