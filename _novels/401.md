My wife, three months pregnant, aborted our child against my will to make room for her childhood friend's baby because he was terminally ill.

Afterward, she calmly stated, "Ryan doesn't have much time left. Why would you argue with a dying man? I promise you, once I give birth to Ryan's baby, we can have another one of our own."

Everyone thought I was head-over-heels in love with her, convinced I wouldn't refuse and would eagerly play the pathetic step-dad.

But this time, I decisively signed the divorce papers and bought a plane ticket abroad the very next day.

I saw my ex-wife again two years later at a class reunion.

The moment she stepped into the private room, she shoved her two-year-old child into my arms, a haughty look on her face.

"Liam, you've been throwing a tantrum for two years. Isn't it time you cooled down? If you apologize to me publicly, I might give you a chance to take care of us, mother and son!"

Everyone stifled their giggles, whispering that I had gotten a good deal, a two-for-one.

But I simply flashed the wedding ring on my left hand.

"No thanks. I already have my own wife and child. No need to be a pathetic chump!"
