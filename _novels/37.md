"You, who is the father of your illegitimate child?"
My parents demanded to know frantically. They wanted to find out who fathered the child I was carrying. I looked at them and suddenly laughed, "The kidnapper."
Shock froze my parents and brother, leaving them pale-faced.
I continued softly, "Don't you remember? The kidnapper asked for ransom, but you chose to save your other beloved daughter instead, saying I needed to learn a lesson."
My mother slumped onto the sofa. "That's impossible. We just wanted to teach you not to bully Adeline. We never thought..."
I knelt before my mother, "You never considered that the kidnapper might violate me, did you?"
Without waiting for her to respond, I pressed on, "Did you really think a group of male kidnappers would show mercy?"
My mother opened her mouth to speak, but I cut her off, "When I returned home covered in scars, why did no one ask me about them?"
"You didn't come to rescue me. You just took Adeline away."
"You didn't come on the first day, or the second, or even after a whole month..."
"Did you think the kidnapper still believed they could get a ransom?"
Now it's over. I'm dying.
