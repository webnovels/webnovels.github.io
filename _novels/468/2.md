This year marks my third year in the borderlands.

Looking at the man and woman kneeling on the ground, I knew I was about to get blood on my hands again. I hated the feeling.

Duke had ordered me to 'handle' this man and woman. Apparently, their only crime was having an affair.

I didn't bother to think twice. The faster it was done, the better.

I dealt with the man quickly and cleanly. But the woman stared at me with wide, tear-filled eyes. Perhaps her tears reminded me of Skylar. In the end, I let her go.

The woman whispered a trembling "thank you."

My heart remained unmoved. I didn't look at her, just walked back to my room.

I'd caught a chill last night, and my head felt heavy. I lit a cigarette, leaving the lights off, just sitting there, silently gazing out the window.

This was a lawless place, home to the world's most vicious criminals and its poorest people.

I lived in this environment, day in and day out.

I almost forgot why I joined this outfit in the first place...

No! I wouldn't forget!

Never!

I narrowed my eyes. The nicotine stimulated my nerves, making me feel much clearer.

My phone vibrated on the table. I picked it up and put it to my ear.

"Sterling wants to see you."

Just a few words, but I couldn't help but tremble.

I hung up the phone and laughed, a rush of excitement.

The head of the syndicate wanted to see me. The ruthless leader who dealt in all kinds of dark trades, whose hands were stained with countless lives!

I was escorted into his office, keeping my head down.

The man stood there, his back to me. His corpulent frame, surprisingly, still exuded a formidable presence.

He was the most vicious gangster in this dark territory.

He turned, waving a hand.

Immediately, two men rushed forward and attacked me.

Heavy blows landed on my gut. Even with years of training, my body still struggled to cope. My abdomen cramped with sharp pains, and I felt something clawing its way up my throat.

I couldn't help but cough twice, blood mixed with bile splattered across the floor.

Sterling raised a hand, and the two men stopped beating me.

He walked toward me, step by step.

"Do you know why I called you here?" His voice was thick, muffled.

I said nothing, just glanced at the corner.

A woman was kneeling there. It was the same woman I'd let go earlier that evening.

I smiled, looking directly at Sterling.

I knew he wouldn't kill me.

"You're smart. Different from the others." Sterling took a drag from his cigarette, then tossed a towel at my face. "But being too smart isn't always a good thing."

Sterling turned and waved his hand, signaling that I could leave.

Still silent, I gave him a slight bow, then exited the room.

Standing in the hallway, I thought for a moment.

Maybe I should have just killed him then.

I stood there, staring at the gun in my hand, lost in thought.
