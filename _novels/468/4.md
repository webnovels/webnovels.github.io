I returned to the syndicate, standing before Sterling.

I coolly reported the outcome of the operation.

Caleb and all those who defected with him were eliminated. The few men I brought with me had also unfortunately perished.

As for the shipment, of course, I told them it had all been destroyed.

Sterling listened to my loud report, his expression impassive, only a fleeting frown crossing his face at the news of our lost men before he returned to his usual composure.

"Not bad."

Sterling just tossed a badge at me.

I'd seen that badge before, pinned to the former manager, Caleb. Its meaning was crystal clear.

I silently took the badge, then looked up at Sterling.

This was just the beginning...

I remained impassive.

That night, I returned to my new place.

My old, cramped room had been replaced by a sprawling, luxurious apartment. It was the standard perk for a manager.

Duke still came to see me, giving me a quick rundown of things.

Then he pulled a thick wad of cash from his bag.

Seeing my eyes widen at the sight of the money, he clapped me on the shoulder, satisfied.

Anyone who chose to live this life, to claw their way through this underworld, was chasing the same few things.

And I, a seemingly insatiable money-grabber, was exactly the kind of person they thought they could control.

Only, he didn't know that after he left, I threw the entire wad of cash into the trash without a second glance.

I only had one purpose for being here.

It was the reason I was willing to abandon a comfortable life and a high-paying job to come to this place.

They had no idea I was a patient, calculating madman.


I took over Caleb's work, rarely touching the bloody stuff myself.

Sitting in front of the computer, staring at the colossal sums of money flowing in and out, the endless invoices, I finally grasped the sheer scale of the syndicate's operations.

They were involved in almost every dark transaction imaginable.

I searched through the computer, scrolling through photo after shocking photo, searching.

Finally, I found what I was looking for.

A beautiful young woman's photo.

Her smile was gentle, like a delicate narcissus.

My right hand trembled slightly as I scrolled through the woman's information. It listed her merchandise number and details.

"She's alive," a calm female voice said behind me.

My hand instinctively shot to my hip, only to be stopped by a pair of delicate, pale hands.
