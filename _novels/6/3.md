Declan paused for a moment, then sneered, "Don't want to take care of Tessa, so you're trying to run away?
"Don't even think about it. This is what you owe our family. You're supposed to slave away for me!"
I retorted, "No, I'm going home..."
Declan's phone suddenly rang. He gave me a long, unreadable look, then walked away without hearing me out.
A few minutes later, I received a transfer notification from him. The note said: [If you're that bored, go buy some new clothes. Tired of seeing the same two outfits. And if you don't want your brother getting isolated at school, don't even think about running home.]
I wanted to explain to Declan, but remembering I needed to request leave from the orchestra, I put my phone away.
Then, I saw Tessa's new social media post.
[So what if I'm a little moody during pregnancy? He still has to spoil me.]
The accompanying picture showed Tessa telling Declan she wanted grape-flavored oranges.
Declan expressed his shock, but instead of finding her request unreasonable, he just told her to wait patiently.
The next picture showed a large plate piled high with orange peels filled entirely with grape pulp.
Then Tessa said she suddenly didn't feel like eating them, and Declan praised her for knowing not to eat cold things, calling her sensible.
My stomach churned as I looked at the screen.
Once, before a performance, when I was hit with sudden, unbearable abdominal pain, I asked Declan to help me buy medicine.
He had said dropping me off was already enough trouble and told me to stop being dramatic and just endure it.
He left me pale-faced and went to play pool with his friends.
My performance suffered greatly, and the collaborators were furious, almost terminating the contract.
It was only through my desperate pleading, citing my previously excellent performances, that they let me stay.
Arriving at the orchestra hall, I ran into Declan and Tessa, who were passing by.
Declan casually asked, "Didn't you say you had no concerts? Why are you here?"
I told him truthfully I was requesting leave.
Declan smiled with satisfaction. "Good. You know you need to take leave to care for Tessa. It seems you haven't forgotten your duty."
I couldn't be bothered to explain. I tried to walk away but was blocked by Tessa.
"Hollis, you are so nice! But I've never heard music in a place like this before. Can your coworkers play something for me?"
I wondered, "Everyone is busy. Who has time to entertain her?"
I reached for the other door, trying to go around them.
Declan thought I was going to attack Tessa and shoved me straight down the stairs.
"Tessa's pregnant! How can you be so vicious?!"
I fell to the ground, touching the dull ache at the back of my head. The image of Declan's expected hateful glare stole my breath.
He could abandon all trust in me for someone he'd known less than half a year!
Tessa immediately feigned shock, shrinking into Declan's arms.
"No wonder you're a murderer, attacking even an unborn child."
Declan suddenly realized he'd pushed me too hard. He wanted to help me up but couldn't bring himself to push Tessa away.
In the end, he just stared at me without saying or doing anything.
A passing colleague stopped in shock. Tessa immediately added, "Didn't you know? She deliberately ran someone over to dig out their heart!"
A colleague I wasn't on good terms with immediately seized the opportunity.
"Money really lets you do whatever you want, huh? No wonder her skills have slipped so badly, yet she still gets to stay in the orchestra."
I couldn't take it when they insulted my family.
Staggering to my feet, my vision blurry, I grabbed Tessa's collar. My voice was hoarse as I tried to explain.
Amidst Tessa's terrified screams, Declan grabbed my hand but didn't push me away this time.
"You lunatic, calm down! Or else I'll make sure your brother..."
Declan lost his patience, resorting to his usual threats. He yanked my arm and slammed me against the wall.
Unable to bear the false accusations any longer, I raised my voice, interrupting Declan, "Make my brother what? Let the whole world know what he did. Ask him why he wasn't the one who died?! Well, now he's dead! He's dead. Are you satisfied now?!"
