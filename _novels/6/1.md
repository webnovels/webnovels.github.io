"If it weren't for the fact that you need to take care of Tessa later, I would've completely ruined your hand for what you did to her."
Declan's new lover, Tessa, knew I was a violinist and thought my nimble fingers would be perfect for massaging her feet.
I was unwilling, but Declan threatened to go to my brother's school and spread the word that he was a murderer's sibling.
Stifling my disgust, I massaged Tessa's feet. Her sudden shriek made Declan think I was intentionally hurting her.
Afraid I would bully Tessa in the future, Declan directly stomped on my hand, breaking it as a lesson.
My husband Declan was reprimanding me while talking to Tessa on the phone, completely oblivious that my injured hand could no longer hold the water glass steady.
"Declan, you sound so fierce. You're going to scare the baby in my belly," Tessa cooed over the phone.
Declan immediately softened his voice as if protecting something fragile.
"Sorry, I lost my temper again. I've got to work on that. For you, I will."
Then he turned and ordered me, "What are you spacing out for? Go make Tessa her tonic soup!"
At this, the hand that I had been gripping tighter and tighter suddenly lost its strength.
The exact words Declan once said to me were now being directed at Tessa.
Every time we argued and got heated, Declan would quickly apologize, reflecting on his own quick temper.
Declan had told me to voice any dissatisfaction. He promised he would change.
He had sworn that regardless of the reason, he wouldn't let me suffer as long as I married him.
But the promise remained unfulfilled. Influenced by his mother, Declan came to believe that my family orchestrated June's car accident to get the heart for my brother.
He started treating me like a servant, stayed out all night, and openly brought other women home.
He even brazenly told me his mistress was pregnant.
Declan casually gave to someone else the affection that once belonged only to me.
The way Declan looked like he wanted to crawl through the screen to comfort Tessa absolutely tore my heart apart.
Seeing I didn't react, Declan snatched my phone away.
The sudden jolt made me drop the glass I could barely hold, and it shattered at Declan's feet.
His shoes were soaked. Declan roared furiously, "It's just a hand injury! Can't even hold a cup? Are you useless now?"
Declan grabbed my wrist, ready to continue his tirade, but then he saw the faint bloodstains seeping through the gauze.
He hesitated for a second, then his brow furrowed, his voice softening considerably.
"Is it that serious? Why didn't you say so?"
I had told him many times, but Declan just thought I was being dramatic.
I wanted to explain, but the pain in my hand made it difficult to speak.
I dug my fingernails into my palm, trying to distract myself from the throbbing ache when Declan's hand suddenly covered mine.
A ripple disturbed the stagnant water of my heart, and I couldn't help but recall fleeting moments of warmth with Declan.
Before Declan could speak, Tessa's voice came through the phone again.
"Declan, I think the heating is broken. I'm so cold."
Declan sprang up like he'd been electrocuted. Even as I held his hand tightly, he slipped away without hesitation.
Looking at the blood steadily seeping out, I finally understood. The Declan I once knew was gone forever.
Jasper had killed himself. I didn't owe them anything anymore. It was time for me to leave.
