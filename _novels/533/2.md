After getting home, I washed up and went straight to bed.

In the middle of the night, while I was sound asleep, I heard the sound of the door opening.

I knew it was Zachary coming back.

Annoyed at being woken up, I kept my eyes closed and pretended to be asleep, not wanting to deal with him.

The soft footsteps stopped at the bedside, and there was silence for a long time.

Even with my eyes closed, I could feel his intense gaze on me.

Is Zachary crazy?

Why doesn't he just wash up and go to sleep instead of staring at me when he gets back?

It's really annoying to disturb someone's sleep like this.

Could it be because I didn't turn on all the lights in the apartment and sit angrily in the living room waiting for him to come back, then question and argue with him like I used to?

He should be happy, shouldn't he?

After all, in the past, whenever I went crazy or even became hysterical, he would just stand by coldly, his eyes full of impatience and disgust.

His condescending gaze made me feel like a ridiculous clown.

In the past, when I argued with him about his relationship with Chloe, he would at least explain a little, saying they were just friends and had never crossed any lines, that I was overthinking things.

Later, he couldn't even be bothered to explain anymore.

He would let me explode with emotion like a volcano, then slowly burn out on my own.

Now, I've finally come to terms with it and let it go.

Thinking back to how I used to be, I really was quite crazy. I must have looked so ugly when I had those emotional breakdowns.

No wonder Zachary was disgusted.

At this moment, I had no desire to question him at all. I just wanted to sleep.

Zachary stared for a while, and seeing no reaction from me, he called out, "Olivia?"

I pretended to be in a deep sleep, not moving at all.

After a moment, he finally left.

I heard the sound of running water from the bathroom. He was washing up.

The faint sound actually had a hypnotic effect, and I fell asleep listening to it. I didn't even know when Zachary came to bed.

The next morning, I got up and went straight to work.

All day, I was immersed in my work, and time passed quickly.

After work, I ate dinner out before going home.

As soon as I walked in, Zachary was sitting on the sofa.

"Why are you home so early today?" I asked while changing my shoes.

"No overtime," he said.

"Oh." I nodded, hung up my bag, and was about to go to the study.

"Olivia." Zachary called out to me, "I bought your birthday gift a long time ago. Yesterday—"

"Thank you!" I took the small, beautifully wrapped box from his hand.

Opening it, I saw a pretty bracelet.

"It's beautiful, I like it," I smiled at him. "I'll wear it tomorrow."

As I was about to leave, Zachary grabbed my arm.

"I'm sorry about yesterday. I stood you up," he explained. "I was almost at the restaurant when I got a call from Chloe. She said her ex-boyfriend was stalking her again, and she was scared. It's not safe for a girl living alone—"

"I believe you," I interrupted him. "It's true that we can't let a girl face danger alone. You've mentioned before that her ex-boyfriend has an unstable personality. Alright, I still have some work to finish, so I'm going to do some overtime."

"Olivia!" He still didn't let go of my arm.

"Hmm?" I looked back at him, confused.

"I haven't eaten dinner yet."

"Oh, I've already eaten. Why don't you order some takeout?"

Saying this, I pulled my arm free and went straight to the study.

Just as I sat down, I heard the front door slam shut.

When I came out to look, Zachary was no longer in the apartment.

He had given me a gift and taken the initiative to smooth things over, but I didn't take the bait.

He was angry.
