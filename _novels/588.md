Chapter 1
Nadine Devine and Hunter Goldman were infamously known as the most toxic married couple alive in their social circle.

In their first year of marriage, he paraded around with young models, so she retaliated by smashing his million-dollar sports car to pieces.

During their second year, he locked her in a walk-in freezer for an entire day; she responded by pushing him, a non-swimmer, straight into a pool.

By the third year, he stopped coming home and was constantly caught in scandals, only for her to storm into every high-end club in the city to drag him back.

They hurled vicious insults by daylight and made hate-fueled love by night, each secretly wishing the other would drop dead.

Then, in their fifth year, Hunter's wish finally came true when Nadine died. She died on her birthday, stabbed a total of 33 times by a masked stranger who broke into their home.

Agony seared through every inch of her body as her consciousness faded. She tried to scream, but only a weak whimper escaped her throat.

"Hunter…"

Her fingers trembled as she groped for the phone beside her. She then used the last shred of strength to dial his number.

When he didn't pick up the first time, she called again. She pressed the button a third time when he ignored it the second time. She lost count of how many times she called before he finally answered.

"Hun—"

She managed to utter a single syllable before his icy voice cut her off. "Nadine, are you deranged? Stop harassing me. I'm not in the mood for your theatrics today. Serena's back. I'm on my way to the airport to pick her up!"

The line went dead with a sharp click. Hunter had hung up, then turned off his phone entirely. His impatience robbed her of the chance to say her final words.

"Hunter… I-I'm dying. Can we not fight… Just this once…"

The phone clattered to the floor, its screen fading to black. A bitter laugh escaped her before her hand fell limp.

…

When her consciousness returned, Nadine found herself standing at the banks of a black river. The River of Forgetfulness swirled before her, its dark waters swirling like an abyss ready to devour everything.

The river's guardian, Lethenia, emerged. She then handed Nadine a cup that was filled with water. "Drink. The river water will bring you peace."

She took the cup and drained it in one gulp. Yet every memory remained.

She then drank a second, and then a third. Nonetheless, nothing had faded even by the tenth cup.

"Ma'am, is this overly diluted?" Nadine asked with a bitter smile.

Lethenia sighed. "Some chains defy even death. What binds you so?"

What was binding her? Nadine squeezed her eyes shut, trembling.

Nadine, Hunter, and Serena Hogan grew up together as childhood friends. Though both women were his childhood companions, Hunter only ever loved Serena.

He would stay by Serena's bedside all night when she had a fever, sneak out past curfew to buy her favorite cherry-flavored ice cream, and gaze at her with endless tenderness.

But Nadine wanted Hunter to look at her too. So she began opposing him at every turn to get his attention. That was how they became sworn enemies over time.

Everything changed when Hunter's grandmother, Emilia Reed, threatened to take her own life unless he married Nadine. Hunter resisted but ultimately surrendered, though he couldn't understand why.

That was until he accidentally discovered Nadine's diary on their wedding night; its pages filled with his name, and that was when Hunter found out she liked him.

At that moment, he became convinced that she was behind it all. He thought she had manipulated Emilia into forcing the marriage, robbing him of any chance to wed his true love. He despised her from then on.

What he never knew was that after his car accident, Serena—the woman he adored—immediately fled abroad when doctors warned he might become a vegetable.

It was Nadine who came to the hospital every day, not knowing if he would ever open his eyes again. She wiped his face, talked to him, and kept vigil at his side. 

Emilia, seeing Nadine's profound devotion and not wanting Hunter to lose someone who genuinely cared for him, insisted on the marriage the instant he regained consciousness.

Nadine wanted to tell him the truth so many times. But every time she met his hate-filled gaze, the words died in her throat.

Those who could not forget their past were not allowed to cross over. As Lethenia shared Nadine's memories, she sighed softly.

"Unresolved regrets shackle your soul. Very well. I shall grant you five days to return to the living world. 

"If you can get Hunter Goldman to say that he loves you, I will restore your life. Fail, and you must let go and move on."

Nadine was stunned. She parted her lips slightly, but Lethenia waved her sleeve before she could speak. A gust of wind swept over her, and darkness swallowed her vision.

By the time Nadine opened her eyes again, she was standing in the familiar villa. Blood was splattered across the floor as her own lifeless body lay sprawled across the tiles, eyes wide and unseeing.

Her heart lurched at the sight. She knelt and reached out with trembling fingers, brushing her corpse's cheek before recoiling at the icy touch.

Her throat constricted as if blocked by an invisible force, making even breathing difficult. She'd spent a lifetime failing to make Hunter say "I love you" to her. How could she possibly succeed in just five days?

Yet deep within her, a fragile voice whispered, "What if… What if he actually says it?"

Now wasn't the time for self-pity. She needed to deal with the immediate crisis first. Bending down, she hauled her own corpse up with tremendous effort, dragging it step by step toward the wardrobe.

The dead weight left her gasping for air, but she didn't dare stop until the body was stuffed inside and the door shut behind it. Only then did she allow herself a shuddering breath.

Next, she filled a bucket with water, knelt on the floor, and began scrubbing away the bloodstains with a rag. Every swipe of the cloth sent a fresh pang through her heart.

The blood might as well have been the scars between her and Hunter—deep, indelible, and etched permanently into her memory.

Just as she wiped away the last stain, an icy, disgusted voice cut through the silence. "Nadine? What are you doing?"

Her body froze, and the rag slipped from her fingers. Turning slowly, she found Hunter standing in the doorway.

Dressed in an impeccably tailored black suit that accentuated his cold elegance, he radiated aristocratic detachment—but his eyes burned with pure revulsion. Nadine stared at him, overwhelmed by a sense of lifetimes passing between them.

Her throat worked, but no sound emerged from it. It was because Hunter hadn't come alone. Standing behind him, flawless as ever, was Serena.

Serena was wearing a white sundress, with her long hair cascading over her shoulders. She was the picture of gentle elegance. 

However, her face turned deathly pale the moment she saw Nadine. Terror flooded her eyes as she stumbled backward several steps, as if she were confronting something monstrous.

Though Nadine and Serena hadn't seen each other in years, this reaction was excessive even for their strained history. Serena's behavior was clearly unnatural.

Even Hunter noticed the abnormality. He asked urgently after steadying her before she could fall, "Serena, what's wrong?"

Serena clutched his arm like a lifeline, visibly struggling to compose herself. "It's nothing... I just caught a whiff of blood and was feeling faint, that's all."

Hunter immediately turned to Nadine, the disgust in his eyes intensifying. "Nadine, must you always cause trouble? It's been five years. When will you finally stop?"

Nadine stood motionless as she met his gaze steadily. When she spoke, each word landed with deliberate clarity. "You want me to stop? Then say it, Hunter. Tell me you love me."

Chapter 2
Nadine's voice was soft, yet it seemed to drain every ounce of her strength. Her eyes shimmered with fragile hope.

Nonetheless, Hunter only let out a cold laugh as his lips curled into a mocking smirk. "Me? Love you? You think you deserve that?"

Then he turned to Serena, his voice softening as he said, "Serena, you're the only one I love."

Serena blushed as she stood behind him, her cheeks tinged with a shy flush.

"Hunter, don't be like this. Nadine will be hurt," she said.

Hunter scoffed, seemingly unmoved. "If she had any shame, she wouldn't have forced me to marry her in the first place."

With that, he took Serena's hand. "Ignore her. Let's go pick your room."

Nadine's heart twisted violently, and the pain was so sharp that she couldn't breathe. She stepped forward to block their path before asking in a trembling voice, "What are you doing?"

Hunter stared at her with an icy gaze. There wasn't a tinge of warmth in his voice. "Serena has just returned to the country, and her place isn't ready yet. She's staying with us for a few days.

"Don't go acting like you're the lady of the house, Nadine. If it weren't for your scheming, this position would've been hers."

Nadine's face immediately drained of color. It was as if she'd been slapped. She would have erupted into a furious fight with him in the past, but now, she only felt exhaustion.

She could only watch helplessly as Hunter walked past her while holding Serena's hand. It was as if she were nothing more than a stranger.

That night, Hunter and Serena sat together at dinner. Their intimate gestures made it seem as though Serena were the lady of the house.

They whispered and laughed while Nadine was completely ignored. She merely kept her head down as she mechanically lifted food to her mouth, but tasted nothing.

The sound of Hunter's cold laughter and Serena's coquettish giggles echoed in her ears, each one stabbing at her heart like countless needles. The pain was so sharp it nearly choked her.

It wasn't until late at night, just before bed, that Nadine accidentally overheard Serena on a phone call in the hallway. "Didn't I tell you to kill her? Why is she still standing here, perfectly fine?"

Nadine's heart plummeted. The glass in her hand slipped and shattered on the floor with a sharp crash. Serena whirled around at the sound, her face instantly turning paper pale.

"You hired that man?" Nadine's voice trembled as her eyes widened in disbelief.

Serena's lips parted, but her gaze flickered to something behind Nadine before she could speak. Suddenly, she threw herself to the ground with a staged cry of pain.

Hunter rushed over at the commotion. His fury ignited as he took in the scene, and he shoved Nadine aside. "What the hell is wrong with you?"

Serena looked up at him with tearful eyes as she clutched Hunter's hand. "Hunter, don't blame her. She's just upset because you confessed your feelings to me today. I don't mind suffering a little if this helps her vent."

Hunter shot Nadine a glare so venomous it could have been meant for his worst enemy. Yet with Serena watching, he held back, not wanting to frighten her.

Instead, he bent down and scooped Serena into his arms, his voice softening as he said, "Let me take you to get treated."

Nadine stood frozen, watching them leave as bitterness flooded her chest. Back in her room, she pulled out the first-aid kit and silently tended to her own wounds.

A thin trail of blood marked her wrist—a cut from when Hunter had shoved her earlier. The antiseptic stung as she applied it, but the pain was nothing compared to the ache in her chest.

Hunter pushed the door open just as she finished tending to the wound. His face was dark, and his voice was dripping with accusation. "Do you live just to cause me trouble?"

Nadine looked up at him with red-rimmed eyes. "Yeah. And what are you going to do about it?"

Hunter didn't answer. Instead, his gaze darkened, and there was a dangerous glint flashing in his eyes.

Nadine knew that look. It was the same harbinger of violence that had preceded every cruel encounter between them.

Sure enough, he strode forward the next second, seized her wrists, and slammed her down onto the bed. He tore at her clothes, his movements rough and detached. It was as if she were nothing more than an object for his rage.

Nadine winced at the pain but clenched her teeth, refusing to make a sound. Pinned beneath him, she couldn't move and was forced to endure as he took what he wanted.

His breath scorched her ear as he growled in a low and icy manner. "Nadine, you'll never have my love."

She shut her eyes, tears slipping silently down her cheeks. As it neared the end, her voice came out hoarse and broken. "Hunter… I love you."

He stilled for a fraction of a second as his face was still buried in the crook of her neck. Then he let out a derisive snort. "But I hate you."

With that, he pulled away and headed to the bathroom, leaving Nadine's cold body alone on the bed.

Chapter 3
When Nadine opened her eyes again, she was alone. Her first thought wasn't that it was a beautiful morning, but rather that she had only four days left.

Time hung over her like a blade, ready to drop at any moment and plunge her into the abyss. She threw off the covers and walked into the bathroom to splash some cold water against her face, bringing a brief moment of clarity.

As she stepped out of her room, the faint clinking of cutlery drew her attention to the dining table. She looked over to see Serena sitting there, leisurely enjoying her breakfast.

Serena looked up and smiled sweetly. "Nadine, you're awake? Hunter left earlier—he was going to cancel his meetings to accompany me to the auction today, but I didn't want him neglecting the company just for me. It took some convincing to finally send him off.

"I could use some company. Why don't you come with me?"

Nadine frowned, instinctively wanting to refuse, but Serena seemed to read her thoughts. She set down her coffee cup gently. "If you don't go with me, I'll just call Hunter and tell him you pushed me down the stairs."

Nadine's fingers tightened slightly as she dug her nails into her palms. She knew Serena's tactics, and above all, she knew how much Hunter trusted her. Hunter would believe Serena's words without hesitation.

As for her, she no longer had time left to explain, nor a chance to argue. She still needed Hunter to tell her that he loved her. She couldn't afford to clash with him now.

So she gave a cold nod. "Fine. I'll go with you."

The car moved steadily toward the auction venue. Nadine remained silent throughout the ride, while Serena sat beside her, occasionally glancing at her phone with a faint smile playing on her lips.

Suddenly, the car jerked to a halt as a black van swerved in front of them, blocking their path. Masked men rushed forward before they could react, yanking them out of the car and shoving them into the van.

Darkness enveloped Nadine's vision. The only sounds she could hear were Serena's shrill screams and their captors' heavy breathing. Rough ropes dug into her wrists, and the pain forced a grimace from her.

The van jolted along for what felt like an eternity before finally stopping. Ultimately, they were dragged out and taken to a deserted dock. The leader of the abductors pulled off his mask, revealing a cold, hardened face.

Nadine recognized him instantly. The man was Stellan Parker, the former CEO of Parker Corp, who had been destroyed by Hunter's hand.

"Stellan?" Nadine frowned. "What do you think you're doing?"

Stellan let out a humorless laugh, and his eyes were burning with hatred. "What am I doing? Hunter Goldman took everything from me. Now I'll make sure he loses what he loves most."

Nadine's stomach dropped. "Stellan, calm down. There's still room for negotiation."

"Calm down?" His voice rose sharply. "I can't calm down! Hunter destroyed my life, and now I'll destroy his!"

With a wave of his hand, his men shoved Serena and Nadine toward the edge of the dock. The inky black sea churned violently below them, its waves like gaping jaws ready to swallow them whole.

Stellan took out his phone and dialed Hunter's number. "Mr. Goldman, both of your women are with me. You have one hour to choose which one to take. The other gets thrown into the sea.

"Remember, you can only pick one."

The line went silent for a moment before Hunter's icy voice came through. "Stellan, if you hurt them, I'll make you wish you were dead."

Stellan burst into laughter. "Hunter, you're in no position to threaten me now. You have one hour. I'll be waiting."

After the call ended, Nadine's heart pounded wildly. She knew Hunter would choose Serena. She had long prepared herself to be abandoned by him, yet despite this, an ache still spread through her chest.

One hour later, Hunter appeared at the dock. His gaze swept over Nadine and Serena before settling on Stellan. His voice was freezing cold as he spat, "Stellan, let them go."

Stellan sneered. "I told you, Mr. Goldman, you can only choose one. Make your decision now. Time's running out."

Hunter's eyes moved between Nadine and Serena before he finally declared coldly, "I won't choose because I'm saving both of them. I won't abandon either one!"

Nadine froze in shock. At the same time, Serena's eyes widened in disbelief, as if she couldn't believe what she'd just heard.

Chapter 4
"I thought you hated me?" Nadine's voice trembled slightly as she spoke.

Hunter shot her a cold glare. "Yes, I hate you. But at least for now, you're still my wife. I'm not like you. I won't stoop to heartless acts that disregard life."

His words pierced through her like a blade. Her heart ached violently, as if something had stabbed deep into it. She opened her mouth, but nothing seemed to come out.

Stellan, who was now clearly enraged by Hunter's defiance, suddenly shoved Serena toward the cliff's edge. "Choose one! Or I'll push them both over!"

Hunter's expression turned dangerously cold. He stepped forward and said in a low and threatening voice, "Stellan, if you lay a finger on either of them, I'll make you wish you were dead."

Just as the standoff reached its peak, police sirens wailed in the distance. Stellan's face turned pale. He hadn't expected the authorities to arrive so quickly.

He lunged at Hunter with a snarl, plunging a knife toward his heart.

"Hunter!" Nadine threw herself between them without thinking.

The blade sank into her shoulder, blood instantly soaking through her clothes. A pained gasp escaped her as her legs gave out.

Hunter caught her, and his eyes flashed with panic. "Nadine!"

Her vision blurred. The last thing she heard was Hunter's frantic voice calling her name. She tried to speak, but darkness swallowed her before she could make a sound.

When she woke again, she found herself lying by the poolside. Hunter stood over her, his gaze burning with hatred.

"Nadine, why did you stage this abduction with those criminals? Did you really think faking a rescue would make me say 'I love you'?"

Nadine stared at him, completely bewildered.

Hunter continued, "Serena told me everything. You planned this abduction with Stellan just to hurt her. Nadine, how could you be so vicious?"

Nadine's heart plummeted as realization struck. Serena had somehow manipulated Hunter into believing this was all her scheme.

"It wasn't me, I didn't—"

Hunter cut her off, his gaze turning glacial. "I know you're spoiled. I know you love acting out to get my attention. But you can target anyone except Serena. She's my life!"

With that, he ordered his men to tie Nadine to a heavy stone and throw her into the pool.

"Hun... Hunter... It wasn't... me..."

Icy water engulfed her instantly as the stone dragged her relentlessly toward the bottom. Her breathing grew labored. The world above the water blurred into shapeless light.

Just as she neared unconsciousness, Hunter's men hauled her up. But they submerged her again before she could gasp more than half a breath.

They did it over and over. It was an endless cycle of torment. After countless drownings, they finally dragged her onto the pool deck, dripping and convulsing like a dying fish.

Hunter crouched beside her, gripping her chin with fingers like steel as he coldly said, "Remember this lesson well, Nadine Devine. If you ever harm Serena again, our next reckoning won't be nearly this merciful."

Then he rose and strode away with his entourage without another glance at Nadine.

Chapter 5
On the third day of the countdown, Nadine received an invitation to a dinner party hosted by mutual friends in their social circle, which requested her attendance alongside Hunter.

Hunter stood at the entrance, dressed in an impeccably tailored dark gray suit that accentuated his cold, aristocratic demeanor. Yet by his side stood Serena.

She wore a white off-shoulder gown. Her hair was in soft waves, her makeup was flawless, and she linked her arm with Hunter's as if she were his wife.

Nadine froze mid-step. Her eyes flickered with pain as she looked at Hunter, but she quickly suppressed it.

As she curved her lips into a mocking smile, she said, "What's this, Mr. Goldman? Are you taking Ms. Hogan to the party instead?"

Hunter shot her a frigid glance, his voice dripping with disdain. "Serena is my date. Do you have a problem with that?"

Nadine's fingers clenched the fabric of her dress, her nails nearly piercing her palms.

"It's no problem. Just a reminder—we're still married. Aren't you worried about gossip if you bring another woman to a public event?"

Hunter scoffed. "Nadine, do you really think I care what people say? You're nothing but a placeholder. Don't overestimate your importance."

With that, he turned and left with Serena, not sparing her another glance. Nadine remained rooted in place, watching their retreating figures as a bitter ache swelled in her chest.

The banquet hall glittered under dazzling lights, filled with distinguished guests. The moment Hunter and Serena entered, all eyes turned toward them.

Hunter seemed determined to humiliate Nadine—he doted on Serena openly throughout the evening. He pulled out her chair, poured her wine, and even whispered in her ear, sparking murmurs among the crowd.

"I heard Mr. Goldman and Nadine are sworn enemies as spouses. The rumor seems to be true."

"Obviously. Look how gentle he is with Ms. Hogan, while he won't even glance at Nadine."

"Poor Nadine. She's the legal wife, yet she looks like an outsider."

The whispers sliced through Nadine like knives. She gripped her wine glass until her knuckles turned white, but she didn't move from her spot.

She knew the more she reacted, the more Hunter would revel in her pain. But the ordeal wasn't over.

Midway through the banquet, Serena excused herself to visit the restroom. Hunter nodded tenderly as she left.

Yet moments later, Serena came rushing back. Her clothes were disheveled, her face was pale with terror, and tears glistened in her eyes.

"Hunter, save me!" She collapsed into his arms.

Her voice trembled as she continued, "Nadine... she hired some thugs... they tried to... to rape me in the restroom!"

The room erupted in gasps. Every eye turned to Nadine—some shocked, some scornful, and others barely tried to hide their glee.

"My God! Nadine actually did this?"

"Is she insane? How dare she attack Serena!"

"Mr. Goldman will never let this slide!"

Chapter 6
As expected, Hunter shot to his feet, his gaze sharp as a blade as it pierced through Nadine. He snatched the wine glass from the table and hurled it to the ground. Glass fragments scattered explosively, and a crimson stain spread across the carpet. 

"Nadine, what did I warn you about last time? If you dare lay a hand on Serena again, I won't let you off!" he seethed.

Nadine stood motionless. Her gaze was steady as she replied with an icy calm, "I didn't touch her."

Hunter's expression darkened further. He strode toward her as he spat, "Do you think she would lie about this? Especially when you've done it before?"

Nadine's fingers trembled slightly, pain flashing in her eyes. She lifted her chin, her voice hoarse with despair as she said, "Then what do you want from me?"

"Get on your knees and apologize to Serena!"

Nadine's pupils constricted as her hands clenched the fabric of her skirt. Her pride felt like it had been trampled into dust.

Gritting her teeth, she spat, "Never! I'd kneel to God and my parents—but never to anyone else!"

She turned to leave, but Hunter's face twisted with fury. He closed the distance in two strides and kicked her sharply behind the knee.

"Ah!" Caught off guard, Nadine crashed to the floor with a heavy thud.

"Apologize!" Hunter commanded, his tone leaving no room for defiance.

Nadine felt her dignity being stripped away layer by layer, as if she'd been stripped naked before a jeering crowd. Her eyes burned as she choked out, "I told you—I didn't do it!"

Hunter sneered and signaled to the bodyguards behind him. Two men immediately stepped forward, gripping Nadine's shoulders and forcing her to kneel.

She tried to struggle, but their strength overpowered her. Her forehead ended up hitting the floor with a dull thump. Murmurs grew louder around them, and each whisper was like a knife plunging into her heart.

"I didn't think Nadine Devine would end up like this!"

"Mr. Goldman is ruthless. He didn't leave her any dignity at all."

"I mean, it serves her right for always bullying Serena."

"Still won't you admit your mistake, Nadine?" Hunter's voice carried impatience.

Nadine felt like her self-respect was completely crushed. A wave of indescribable despair rose in her chest. Summoning all her strength, she suddenly broke free from the bodyguards' grip, stood up, and slapped Hunter hard across the face.

The sharp sound of the slap cut through the silent banquet hall like a crack of thunder.

"Hunter!" Her voice trembled with tears as they finally spilled over. "I told you I didn't do it! Is everything she says the truth, and everything I say a lie? I know you love her to death, but I'm your wife! What am I? What am I to you?"

Her words were laced with despair and anguish, as if she were pouring out all the grievances and bitterness she had bottled up inside.

This was the first time she had cried in front of Hunter—the first time she had ever shown him her vulnerability. Just like that, Hunter froze. He had never seen Nadine like this before.

She had always been stubborn and never showed any weakness. But now, she resembled a cornered animal as her eyes filled with hopelessness and pain. Something inexplicable stirred in his chest, like some long-held conviction had begun to crumble.

He opened his mouth but found no words to respond. Nadine stared at him through her tears, and her voice was hoarse with despair. "Hunter, remember this—I owe you nothing!"

With that, she turned and strode out of the banquet hall. Hunter remained rooted in place, the stinging pain on his face bringing him back to his senses. As he watched Nadine's retreating figure, an indescribable, unsettling emotion surged within him.

Chapter 7
The second-to-last day of the countdown marked the anniversary of Nadine's parents' death. She woke early, dressed in plain black mourning clothes, and prepared to leave to visit their graves.

Just as she reached the door, Hunter stopped her. "I'll go with you."

Nadine paused mid-step and turned to glare at him coldly. "What now? Going to have your bodyguards force me to kneel to Serena again?"

Hunter's expression darkened instantly. He had originally intended to ease tensions between them, but Nadine's attitude reignited the anger he'd just suppressed.

"You were in the wrong yesterday. Are you really going to keep this up?"

Nadine scoffed and pushed past him, heading straight for the door. But when she reached the car, she found Serena already seated in the passenger seat, smiling gently at her.

"Nadine, Hunter said you guys are going to visit your parents together. I wanted to come too."

Nadine's fury erupted.

She whirled around to face Hunter. "Hunter, this is where I cross the line! She doesn't get to visit them!"

Hunter frowned. "Nadine, don't go too far. Serena means well. Don't be ungrateful."

"Means well?" Nadine's eyes flashed with scorn. "Hunter, have you forgotten? Today is my parents' death anniversary, not your date night!"

Serena sighed. "Nadine, why do you hate me so much? We used to get along, didn't we? Why are you always against me?"

Nadine let out a cold laugh, and she shot Serena an icy glare. "You know exactly why I hate you."

Hunter had had enough. He grabbed her wrist and yanked her into the car. "Nadine, stop making a scene. Get in."

She struggled but couldn't break free from his grip. The car sped to the cemetery. Unwilling to look at the pair behind her, Nadine clutched the chrysanthemums and hurried ahead to her parents' graves.

She crouched down and gently placed the flowers before the tombstone, her fingertips brushing against the cold stone surface as a flicker of pain flashed through her eyes.

"Dad, Mom, I've come to visit you."

Hunter had followed without her noticing and now stood behind her, gazing at the tombstone with complex emotions. "Dad, Mom, though I don't like Nadine, I'll take care of her for life."

Nadine's body stiffened abruptly. After a long pause, she gritted her teeth. "I don't need that. Just say you love me."

Hunter's expression instantly turned icy. "That's impossible, Nadine. Don't push your luck. I told you I could never love you."

The words stabbed through Nadine's heart, and she fell silent. After paying respects at the grave, Hunter left with Serena while Nadine lingered, standing before the grave and whispering a few more words to her parents.

She was about to leave when a staff member, James Orwell, stopped her. "Ms. Devine? There's something we thought you should know."

Nadine frowned, an ominous feeling rising in her chest. "What is it?"

James lowered his head, and his voice was tinged with guilt. "Actually... your parents' ashes... Ms. Hogan had them scattered."

Nadine's pupils contracted sharply, barely able to believe what she'd heard. "What did you say?"

James sighed. "A few days ago, Ms. Hogan forced us to dig up your parents' ashes. She threatened us when we refused, saying she was Mr. Goldman's beloved and that the Goldman family would make our lives miserable if we disobeyed.

"We had no choice but to comply. But our conscience wouldn't let us keep it from you."

Nadine's mind went blank as a deafening buzz filled her ears. When she came to her senses again, she was already sprinting out of the cemetery. After making inquiries, she stormed straight into the club where Hunter and Serena were.

Dim lights pulsed to the deafening beat of music inside the club. When Nadine burst into the private room, she saw Hunter and Serena sitting on the couch playing a game of truth or dare.

Serena had lost, and the penalty required her to kiss Hunter. She lowered her head with feigned shyness and slowly leaned toward Hunter.

Nadine charged forward just as Serena's lips were about to touch Hunter's. She grabbed a liquor bottle from the table and smashed it against Serena's head.

The bottle shattered with a loud crash. Serena screamed and collapsed to the floor as blood streamed from her forehead.

Screams erupted around them, and no one had time to react except Hunter. He stood and immediately slapped Nadine across the face.

"Nadine, have you lost your mind?"

A trickle of blood seeped from the corner of Nadine's mouth, but she barely registered the pain. "I've lost my mind? She's the insane one! Do you know what she did to my parents?"

Hunter's expression darkened. "Your parents are dead. What could she possibly have done?"

"Their ashes!" Nadine's voice trembled, tears falling uncontrollably. "She scattered my parents' ashes!"

Hunter froze, shock flashing in his eyes. But Serena burst into theatrical sobs, her voice dripping with false innocence. "I didn't... Nadine, why would you accuse me like this?"

Hunter seemed to recall something too, and his face instantly turned cold. "Nadine, have your framing tactics become this cheap now? How could Serena possibly do such a thing when your parents doted on her since childhood?

"You just saw us about to kiss outside and came looking for trouble, didn't you? Let me make this clear, Nadine. Even if Serena and I had kissed, which we didn't, I won't let you off if you dare lay a finger on her."

Nadine stood frozen, her eyes brimming with tears. She suddenly threw her head back and laughed as she watched Hunter shield Serena protectively.

Her laughter turned to weeping, and tears began streaming down her face. "Hunter, you're s
