"After the reunion, my wife’s high school sweetheart wrecked his car.

My wife, a lawyer, told me to get behind the wheel and take the blame.

“Ethan's got points on his license, Liam. Just take the hit for him, okay?”

“If there are any legal issues, I’ll defend you.”

I didn't argue. I just stared at her as she led her precious Ethan away.

Last time, I fought back, convinced her not to ask me to lie.

But the accident wasn't so simple.

He was drunk and killed six people. He got eight years and jumped off the prison roof.

My wife acted like he deserved it, but on our anniversary, she slipped poison into my dinner.

“It’s your fault! If you hadn’t been so stubborn that night, Ethan would still be alive!”

I died full of despair. Then I woke up again, back to the moment she asked me to lie.

This time, she still chose her first love.

But this time, I’m done with her."
