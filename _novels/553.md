I told the school's notorious bad boy that I was Briar's real boyfriend.
I pulled out all the stops to keep them apart.
After graduation, Briar found out the truth and broke down, crying.
She hated me for destroying her love story.
Even on the day I died, she was still cursing me, calling me selfish, a despicable jerk, worse than a dog.
As a twisted form of revenge, she deliberately didn't tell my family about my critical condition.
I never got to say goodbye to them.
I died with my eyes wide open, consumed by bitterness.

After I was reborn, I chose to let go.
She finally got her wish, pregnant with the bad boy’s baby.
