Cora's dad forced me to donate bone marrow to the fake heiress.

When I felt all hope was lost, my boyfriend unexpectedly proposed we marry sooner and took me home.

But after the wedding, he seemed restless every night.

I thought it was because he loved me so much.

Then I found out I was pregnant and overheard him talking to my dad:

"Your plan's brilliant. Let Cora's child be the donor for Adeline's bone marrow. Once Adeline recovers, I'll keep my promise and marry her."

"But this is your child too. Can you really be so heartless?"

The husband who had always been gentle and loving towards me now had a look of cold indifference:

"If Cora had agreed to donate her bone marrow to Adeline, I wouldn't have needed to marry her. She owes Adeline and should repay the favor."

Hearing this, my dad solemnly patted Asher on the shoulder.

"I'm sorry for putting you through this. To save Adeline, you had to approach Cora and sacrifice such a significant life event."

"Once it's done, I'll give you an extra three percent on the Asher family project."

A flicker of delight crossed Asher's face.

"Thank you, Dad. I'll be devoted to Adeline in the future!"

Hiding outside the study, I trembled in fear.
