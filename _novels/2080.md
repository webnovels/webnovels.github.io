With my family's international business expansion keeping me abroad, I'd been largely absent from North America.

Concerned about my single status, Mom insisted I return home to accept an arranged engagement with the son of a local tycoon.

But the moment I arrived at my engagement party, I discovered my photo had been replaced with a dog's picture!

Before I could process what was happening, my fiancé’s secretary sauntered over arrogantly and thrust a bag of dog waste into my hand.

“What are you staring at? The birthday party starts soon. Go dispose of this.”

Clenching my jaw to contain my rage, I demanded, “This is my engagement party. And you expect me to do this?”

She brushed off my question with a dismissive wave.

“Just do it. Quit wasting time with questions.”

“Mr. Carter personally authorized me to run today’s event.”

I paused in shock, then pulled out my phone and dialed my fiancé directly.

“Kyle, you and the Carters think turning my engagement party into a dog’s birthday bash doesn’t require an explanation?”
