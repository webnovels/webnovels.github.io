After that deal was secured, I distinctly felt the company's morale rise significantly.

I instructed the finance department to issue a bonus to every employee as encouragement for their hard work.

This would better maintain employee loyalty.

I also specifically promoted the young assistant who had accompanied me to the negotiation, putting him in charge of liaising with Mr. Henderson.

And I specifically invited Caleb to dinner at an elegant, traditional restaurant.

Caleb and I chatted about our university days. I couldn't help but remark, "You were quite the campus celebrity back then, you know. So many girls had crushes on you."

Caleb just smiled, not saying anything.

"And now you're doing so well! What lucky woman gets to marry you?"

Caleb paused for a moment, then said, "I've been divorced for a long time."

I felt a little awkward. It seemed I had said the wrong thing.

Caleb smiled, reassuring me, "It's been a long time. I've moved on."

With him saying that, I didn't know what else to say, so I just chuckled and changed the subject.

I asked Caleb why he suddenly appeared that day to help me.

He then told me a story.

He said that once, a young man, poor and about to drop out of school, met an old man fishing in the park. Seeing how distraught he looked, the old man kindly asked what was wrong.

At that time, the young man told him he was going to quit school.

The old man disagreed and urged him to continue his studies, assuring him not to worry about tuition.

The old man asked for his ID and school details.

He thought that day he had met a con artist, but it turned out he had met a savior.

Because soon after, a sum of money appeared in his bank account, enough to see him through to university graduation.

Caleb looked intently into my eyes. "That man was your father."

"After I started university, I met you. But back then, you already had a boyfriend."

"I told myself that if you ever faced any difficulties, I would help you with all my might."

"That day, I appeared on purpose."

So, it was my deeply loving father, helping me all along.

My eyes welled up with tears. What goes around comes around.

I would carry on my father's generosity.

Once I fully took over the group, I would establish a foundation.

To help those in need.
