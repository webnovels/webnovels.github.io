Truly, there's no limit to shamelessness. It seems I need to accelerate my return to the company.

But before I could even start making plans.

That evening, Aria's homeroom teacher called me, saying Aria had gotten into a fight at school.

I rushed over, only to find my husband, Damian, who was supposed to be on a business trip, already there.

In the office, besides him, was Seraphina, his mistress. She was crying hysterically, holding her daughter, Celeste, and accusing Aria of bullying her.

My daughter stood helplessly to the side.

Damian showed no inclination to defend Aria. He even wanted her to apologize to Seraphina's daughter, Celeste.

Aria stubbornly said, "I didn't do anything wrong, why should I apologize?"

Seeing this, Damian raised his hand, intending to slap Aria across the face.

I pushed open the door and walked in, radiating power.

"Try to hit my daughter, I dare you."

His hand froze in mid-air, unable to strike.

Damian glared at me with disgust. "Look at the daughter you've raised! Bullying others!"

I scoffed. "My daughter would never bully anyone. And you, you want her to apologize without even knowing the reason?"

"Are you even her real father? Anyone would think you're someone else's dad!"

His expression flickered with panic for a second. I ignored him.

I asked Aria what happened. She said Celeste was bullying Chloe, and she stepped in to defend Chloe.

It was then I noticed a small girl in the corner of the office, likely Chloe, the girl Aria mentioned.

I patted Aria's shoulder, reassuring her.

To my surprise, my husband actually interjected.

"Why are you so reckless, sticking your nose where it doesn't belong? And you scratched Celeste's face like that!"

It was just like in my previous life. Damian had always sided with his illegitimate daughter, blaming Aria for being reckless and for stepping in.

Back then, I also thought Aria was undignified, not behaving like a proper young lady.

I completely ignored Aria's intentions and just kept scolding her.

This time, I absolutely wouldn't do that again. I glared at him. "Shut up."

I turned to Aria's homeroom teacher, who hadn't spoken yet. "I believe the teacher has already clarified the situation."

"My daughter was acting heroically. I don't believe she did anything wrong."

The one who was wrong was the bully, Damian's illegitimate daughter.

The girl Aria had protected, Chloe, looked timid.

But she also confirmed that Aria had stepped in for her.

As a homeroom teacher, she naturally knew the character of the students in her class.

The teacher asked Celeste to apologize to Chloe and Aria, but Celeste looked defiant.

Seraphina also wouldn't let her daughter apologize, insisting that her daughter would never bully anyone, that she was a good girl.

She then cast a pitiful look at Damian, daring to flirt and provoke me right in front of me.

I scoffed. Damian looked conflicted.

He shamelessly spoke up, "How about we just let it go? It's not like Aria was hurt."

I scoffed again.

"Whether we 'let it go' or not is not up to you."
