I parachuted in to take over this company that was on the verge of being shut down.

On my first day, the existing executive director tried to put me in my place.

Whatever materials I requested, she claimed weren't available.

Employee morale was also very low.

The company was a mess, and that executive director even arrogantly said, "This is how we usually operate."

I flew into a rage, deciding to make an example out of her. I fired her on the spot.

I told her to go to accounting to settle her severance. She was furious, claiming I had no right to fire her.

I ignored her shouting and simply encouraged the others, "I've taken over this company, and I will lead you to success. Work hard with me, and I won't let you down."

No matter how nice the words sounded, without actual results, there was no convincing power.

What I needed most was a big deal, one that could revive this company.

That evening, I arranged a meeting with some potential partners and, accompanied by a young assistant, went to negotiate a contract.

To my surprise, I met a bald Mr. Henderson. He brazenly eyed me up and down, then coarsely insisted I drink with him.

I thought, "I'll endure this if I can." For the sake of the deal, I drank.

But then he reached out, trying to grope me. My assistant was a man, waiting outside the private room.

I wanted to twist his arm off, but then someone walked into the room.

The moment Mr. Henderson saw him, his eyes lit up as if he'd struck gold.

He ran over like a bootlicker.

"Well, Mr. Caleb! It's rare to see you here. Come, come, let me toast you."

I looked up. It was Caleb Sullivan, my old university classmate.

I never imagined he'd be doing so well now.

Caleb exchanged pleasantries with Mr. Henderson, then sat down.

He said, "I hear you're discussing a contract with Ms. Sterling, Mr. Henderson. I wonder if I could get a piece of that action?"

Mr. Henderson smiled obsequiously, "Of course, Mr. Caleb! With your involvement, it would be twice as easy. Everyone knows following Mr. Caleb means good profits!"

Just like that, a major deal was sealed.

I looked at Caleb with gratitude. It was all thanks to him that things went so smoothly.

I took the opportunity to add Caleb's contact information.
