At dinner, Aria was still very reserved.

I remembered how she used to come home from school, excited to share her day's stories during dinner.

But I would sharply hit her arm with my fork.

Back then, I'd glare at her and say, "What did Mom teach you? No talking at the dinner table. Silence while eating, silence while sleeping."

After that, she remembered it well.

Now, thinking about it, we were a family. Why did we need so many rules?

I served Aria her favorite braised pork ribs, telling her to eat more.

"From now on, you can tell Mom anything."

Aria looked surprised but obediently said, "Okay."

After dinner, Aria dutifully went back to her room to study.

I sat in the living room, sipping tea, thinking about how to deal with that despicable couple.

Suddenly, Mrs. Davis, our housekeeper, walked over.

"Madam, this package is for you."

I opened it. It was a photo, dated for today.

In the picture, my husband was hugging Seraphina, celebrating their daughter's birthday.

In the past, seeing this would have sent me into a furious rage.

Now, I just felt a quiet sense of irony. Well, isn't that convenient?

I needed to save this. Wasn't this clear evidence of Damian's infidelity?

The photo, without a doubt, was sent by Seraphina to provoke me.

It wasn't the first time I'd received something like this, but before, my mind wasn't clear, and I'd just endured it.

This time, I planned to remain calm, not to swallow my anger.

It was just that I couldn't divorce him yet. I needed to regain control of the company first. Even though the company shares were still in my name.

Damian had been managing the business for so many years that he had successfully sidelined me from the company's management.

Once I had control again, I'd kick that scumbag out, leaving him with absolutely nothing.

Then, I'd like to see if his love with Seraphina was truly as solid as gold.
