Chloe, Noah's childhood friend, used witchcraft to exchange ten years of her life for my Certified Senior Real Estate Broker Exam passing qualification.
She quickly became a top-tier real estate broker, pulling in over a million dollars a year.
Meanwhile, I was reported for cheating, blacklisted from the entire industry, and ended up homeless.
I turned to Noah for help, but he looked at me with disbelief.
"You're useless and couldn't pass on your own, and now you're slandering Chloe? I never thought you'd be this kind of person!"
I had no way to defend myself. 
Chloe sued me for defamation, and Noah even testified against me in court.
I was ultimately sentenced to ten years.
Noah and Chloe promptly announced their engagement on social media. 
They were just waiting for their honeymoon to end before starting their new jobs.
In a daze, I fell into a river and drowned.
When I opened my eyes again, I was back one week before the Certified Senior Real Estate Broker Exam.
I tossed my admission ticket into the trash with a flick of my wrist, then signed up for the janitorial staff training test instead.
If Chloe wants to trade ten years of her life for my Certified Senior Real Estate Broker qualification, then let her go for it!
