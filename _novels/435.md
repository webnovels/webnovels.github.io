The day after I had a fight with my husband over his first love, a young, energetic guy showed up at my door soaking wet.

"Please, can I stay here?" he begged.

Without hesitation, I let him stay for three months.

During those three months, he did everything he could to make me happy and win my affection.

Everyone said he had ulterior motives and was getting close to me for some other purpose. They warned me not to fall for him.

Sure enough, as soon as I agreed to be with him, Jason smirked and told me he was Jessica's childhood friend, and he had only gotten close to me for her happiness.

But I already knew that, and I had collected evidence of my husband's affair with his first love.

"Thanks for helping me gather evidence. Now you can get lost."
