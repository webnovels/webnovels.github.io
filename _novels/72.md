When I opened my eyes, I found myself kneeling in Jasper's study.

Memories of my past life surged back.

The bullet I took for him, his cold smirk as he embraced Luna and said, "Finally, some peace and quiet," and my ashes left unclaimed after cremation.

"Sign the divorce papers."

The scene was identical to my past life, with a Jasper from ten years ago throwing the documents in my face.

I chuckled softly and decisively signed my name with the pen.

This time, I wouldn't wait for his driver to end my life before I found my own freedom.

"Mr. Gu."

I pushed the papers back and stood up, meeting his shocked gaze. "This time, I'm the one who doesn't want you."

As I turned, he grasped my wrist with surprising force. "Nora, you..."

I pried his fingers off one by one. The touch I couldn't beg for in my past life now only disgusted me.

Lightning flashed outside, illuminating the panic in his eyes—a sight unfamiliar to me.

How laughable. The attention I couldn't earn in my past life came so easily now.
