I replicated my Grandpa's masterpiece for the dessert competition, but my fiancé's childhood friend accused me of using addictive poppy seed pods.

I frantically searched for evidence to prove my innocence, yet my fiancé locked me inside, embracing me in tears and even promising to marry me.

"I'm sorry, I love you, but Sophia really needs this trophy. This is the last time; I promise you'll rise to the top again next time."

Sophia took home the competition trophy, while my Family Heirloom Signature Dessert was scorned by thousands.

This was the 99th time he took something that belonged to me for her, turning me into a laughingstock in the dessert community.

With her wish fulfilled, Oliver Thompson finally stopped blocking my participation and even asked me to make the Family Heirloom Dessert for their wedding after I won.

Yet they didn't know, my hands had long been severed by his childhood friend.

...

"What's going on? Isn't this the granddaughter of Dessert Master Ethan Johnson, Mia Johnson? How did she end up like this?"

"Look at her, she seems like she's been seriously ill. This is the International Dessert Competition. She's not here just to humiliate herself, right?"

Amid the mocking voices, two bodyguards pushed me in front of Oliver Thompson. His face darkened, and he slapped me angrily.

"I gave you a chance to showcase your family creation, but you still pretend to be pitiful. How ungrateful!"

"Besides, you're infamous now because of the poppy seed pods incident. Today is also a chance for you to turn your life around. You better prepare well."

I lowered my head silently, while Sophia Thompson began to exaggerate the story.

"Oliver, do you think Mia is still mad at me? After all, I won the trophy 99 times before. Maybe I should withdraw from the competition..."

Her eyes reddened as she cried in Oliver's arms. He comforted her with a tenderness I'd never seen.

"Baby, don't cry. That glory was always yours. With you here, he'll always look up to you!"

The reporters and Sophia's fans started jeering.

"Mia Johnson has some guts, losing to Sophia 99 times. If it were me, I'd have smashed my head long ago."

"I heard her Grandpa's dessert recipe was stolen from Sophia's family, and she's a mistress interfering with Mr. Thompson and Sophia. What a shameless family!"

Hearing this, my heart trembled. They could slander me all they wanted, but why defame my Grandpa! He poured his heart into his craft, achieving success through a lifetime of dedication. He was kind and always helped the poor and weak. Why should he bear such disgrace after death!

I gritted my teeth and stood up, facing the camera.

"Stop lying! My Grandpa never stole anyone's recipe. The Johnson family's pastry is entirely original!"

But the audience didn't believe me, only responded with disdainful snorts. I looked to Oliver for an explanation.

Oliver stepped back with a look of disgust.

"Your Johnson family is notorious. Why should I explain for you? Prove yourself if you have the ability."

I was pushed to the dessert station by the staff. Looking at the shiny kitchen tools, an indescribable emotion welled up inside me. This place, so familiar, should have been filled with a sense of mission and honor, yet it always brought back painful memories.

Once, Oliver Thompson loved me dearly. He said my desserts were the best he'd ever tasted, something he could never tire of. Yet he imprisoned me in a basement, repeatedly making me a foil for Sophia.

After being forced to lose to Sophia for the 99th time, I finally refused. Oliver looked at me with deep sorrow.

"Mia, being a pastry chef is Sophia's dream. Please don't compete with her, just this once?"

"You still have me. I'll love you forever, but Sophia lost everything saving me. I can't bear to see her lose her career too!"
