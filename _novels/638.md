Chapter 1
"My poor daughter… She died without a child of her own…" Carol Smith, Julian Whitmore's mother-in-law, wept. "Bianca and Bethany are twins, Julian. Their DNA is identical.

"Please, I'm begging you. Let Bianca bear your brother's seed. Our family has a tradition of surrogacy. Since they're genetically identical, it would be as if Bethany had a child with your brother."

Julian's face turned as pale as a sheet. His father, Richard Whitmore, chimed in before Julian could utter a single word.

"Julian, ever since Bethany died, it's like Nathan's lost a part of himself. He barely eats and sleeps. If he goes on like this, I'm worried that he'll lose himself.

"I'm begging you to just say yes. Let Bianca bear his child. It would give him something to live for. It would also be good for both families."

Judging by the way they spoke, it seemed as if Julian would be the one forcing his brother to death if he refused.

He bit down hard on his lower lip, staying silent. Richard had always favoured Nathan Whitmore of his two sons. By now, Julian had long grown used to it. What mattered most to him now was what his wife, Bianca Prescott, thought. 

Julian was the middle child, sandwiched between an older brother and a younger sister. Growing up, he had been the least favoured child. He never understood what it meant to be loved until he met Bianca.

Unlike everyone else, Bianca always put him first. 

When he fell sick, his parents only had him visit the doctor on his own. Conversely, Bianca would drop everything she was doing to care for him and stay by his side, even if it was just a cold.

Whenever they went shopping, she paid him close attention. If Julian glanced at something in the store for more than a brief moment, it would appear by his bedside the very next day. 

No matter how challenging the circumstances, Bianca would wake up at dawn to stand in line for his favorite snacks.

Bianca was born into luxury. She was the kind of woman who never had to lift a finger for anyone. But for Julian, she was willing to stand in line for hours.

She handled everything that had to do with him herself. She even designed their engagement rings with her own hands. 

That night, during the proposal, she held his gaze and whispered, " Jules, your parents may not truly love you, but I promise to be the one who loves you the most from now on. I understand every wound and worry you carry.

"I swear to always put you first once we're married. No one will ever take your place in my heart." 

Before they were married, Bianca always stood by Julian, unwavering in her devotion. Now, she did the very same, stepping forward and placing herself between her parents and Julian.

"Please stop pressuring him," she said firmly. "This is utterly ridiculous. Not only will Jules not agree to this—I won't either!"

As she spoke, she dropped to her knees before them. "Bethany died saving me. I know I should be repaying Nathan for that, but I cannot betray Jules. I will do anything for Nathan—anything except bear his child!" 

Carol cried until her eyes were nearly swollen shut, but Bianca remained unmoved. She kneeled before Bethany's grave in silence. She did not get up for the entire day.

Julian's eyes burned with unshed tears. He had married the right woman.

Bianca was the one person in the world who loved him most.

But that night, after the house had gone quiet, Julian heard Nathan's heavy, ragged breathing. 

It stopped him cold. Had Nathan remarried so soon?

The sounds of passion continued, echoing in Julian's ear. Overcome by curiosity, he put on a jacket and crept upstairs. 

Nathan's bedroom door was left ajar. 

Inside, Nathan's broad-shouldered figure was sprawled over a pale woman. His strong hips thrusted in a steady rhythm. 

The woman's face was hard to see in the darkness, but something about her felt familiar.

Just then, a shaft of moonlight slipped in through the curtains and landed on her face. That was when Julian saw her clearly for the first time.

The woman whispering beneath Nathan was none other than the woman who had stood by him so fiercely mere hours ago—his wife, Bianca.
