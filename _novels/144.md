When I opened my eyes, I found myself kneeling in Ethan's study.

Memories from my past life came flooding back like a tidal wave. The bullet I took for him, his cold smirk as he held his mistress and said "Finally, some peace and quiet" as I lay dying, and the urn of ashes that no one claimed at my cremation.

"Sign the divorce papers," Ethan demanded, tossing the documents in my face. It was the exact same scene from my previous life, but he looked a decade younger now.

I lowered my head and chuckled softly, the pen making a decisive arc across the paper.

This time, I wouldn't wait for his driver to run me over before I found my freedom.

"Mr. Greene," I said, pushing the agreement back towards him. I stood up, meeting his shocked gaze. "This time, I'll be the one to leave you first."

As I turned to go, he suddenly grabbed my wrist with surprising force. "Olivia, what are you—"

I pried his fingers off one by one. The touch I had begged for on my knees in my past life now only made me sick.

Thunder crashed outside, illuminating the unfamiliar panic in his eyes.

How ironic. The glance I would have died for in my previous life came so easily now that I'd been given a second chance.
