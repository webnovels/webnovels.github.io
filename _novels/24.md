Six months ago, my daughter was diagnosed with kidney failure and needed me to donate a kidney for her transplant.
But on the eve of the surgery, I accidentally discovered that my daughter wasn't sick at all!
The one who really needed my kidney was my husband Jack's ex-girlfriend's son!
It turned out to be a scheme set up by Jack to trick me into donating my kidney.
My daughter was also a participant and accomplice in this deception. I was the only one kept in the dark!
At that moment, ten years of marriage and family bonds crumbled, leaving only heartbreak and despair.
I threw the divorce papers at Jack, along with custody of our daughter. I didn't want it anymore.
"Tricking you was wrong, but is divorce really necessary?" Jack frowned. "Besides, I just wanted you to donate a kidney. You won't die from losing one, but Tommy will die in a few days without a good kidney."
I closed my eyes briefly and pushed the divorce agreement towards Jack. "Sign it."
"Look, you've been a housewife for ten years. You're completely out of touch with society. I've been supporting you all these years. You can't survive without me," Jack shook his head helplessly. "Stop being unreasonable. Go to the hospital with me tomorrow for the kidney donation surgery. Don't worry, I won't look down on you for being partially disabled after the surgery. I'll still give you a monthly allowance and take care of you."
"How dare you talk about divorce! You're just a maid who eats and lives in our house," my daughter Lily angrily shouted at me. "Besides, why won't you donate? You're only losing a kidney, but Tommy will lose his life!"
I stared at her in disbelief, unable to believe my sweet daughter would say such things.
"A woman like you with a ruined figure, average looks, and no skills - what man would want you if you left Dad? Even if you tried to throw yourself at a homeless person under a bridge, they wouldn't want you!" Lily looked at me with disgust and held a mirror up to my face. "Look at yourself, you're like a pig! Fat and ugly. It should be your honor to donate a kidney to Natalie's son! Don't be so ungrateful!"
The person in the mirror looked haggard and aged, completely different from ten years ago.
"Are you going to say again that you developed health problems from overworking during postpartum recovery, and that taking medication for years made you gain weight?" Lily rolled her eyes. "Please, don't blame me for your laziness and lack of self-discipline. Natalie also had a child, so how come she's still so slim?"
I remembered how Lily never let me attend parent-teacher conferences. I thought she was being considerate of my weak health and inability to handle crowds. It turns out I was just deluding myself - she was actually ashamed of me.
The family I thought was happy and complete turned out to be nothing but a mess.
