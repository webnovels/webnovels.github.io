At the dinner table, I dropped my fork. As I bent down to pick it up, I saw my brother's foot stretched out between my girlfriend's legs.
He said, "Your current girlfriend has pretty slim legs. I approve."
Later, he got together with my girlfriend and told me, "What can I do, Adrian? It seems like none of the women around you can resist me."
I laughed and immediately fell into the arms of the woman he'd loved for five years.

My brother Brandon broke up with my ex-girlfriend.
"We only dated for a month. Isn't it normal to break up?" Brandon said casually, as if he was discussing what to have for lunch.
"But when you sent me those bedroom photos, you said it was true love and hoped I'd give you my blessing," I said, taking a sip of coffee. I glanced at Emma, who was still waiting outside in the scorching heat, and clicked my tongue.
Emma was the beauty queen of our department. Not only was she gorgeous, but she also excelled in her studies. Her family seemed quite wealthy too. Add to that her cool and aloof demeanor, and she was the quintessential campus goddess.
Many guys at our college had fallen for her, including me.
Emma was technically my ex-girlfriend, but not really. After all, I was just her fake boyfriend to ward off unwanted suitors. The day after we publicly announced our relationship, Brandon stole her away.
That night, Brandon sent me several explicit bedroom photos.
"I'm interested in her because you're interested in her," Brandon had said. "But your taste is truly garbage. For your first girlfriend, you chose such mediocre goods."
I knew Brandon wasn't actually into Emma. He just wanted to steal everything I liked, even if he'd discard it later. He didn't want me to have anything.
Since childhood, he'd been jealous that my arrival stole all our parents' love. So anything I liked, he'd find a way to take it for himself.
It was like that with toys when we were little, with nice clothes, and now with the girls I dated.
"My taste wasn't great before, but this time, I'm dating someone high quality," I said, my eyes filled with infatuation.
Brandon looked intrigued by my expression. "Oh really? I find it hard to believe your definition of 'high quality.' When can you introduce us?"
"She's coming to meet me soon."
Just as I finished speaking, I saw Olivia appear at the café entrance. I smiled and said, "There, that's my girlfriend."
She wore a white blouse and had a slender figure. A silver necklace adorned her neck, and she exuded a lazy, carefree aura.
Compared to Emma, this kind of woman gave off an uncontrollable vibe. I was obsessed with women like her, and so was Brandon.
He loved making all sorts of women fall for him, and he especially loved stealing my girlfriends.
I saw Brandon's eyes noticeably brighten. He looked Olivia up and down several times before finally curling his lips meaningfully.
I was all too familiar with that expression of his. It meant he had his sights set on his prey.
The more carefree and unrestrained a woman was, the more she aroused a man's desire to conquer her. When Brandon saw that from the moment Olivia entered, her eyes were only on me, he got even more excited.
I frowned in displeasure.
The reason I dared to bring Olivia to meet Brandon was because I trusted her character. I'd known her for two years, and she was never the type to be seduced by good looks. Emotionally, she was a very loyal woman.
But looking at Brandon's flirtatious eyes and demeanor, I felt a bit uncertain.
Brandon knew exactly how to manipulate women. Take Emma for example - she was so cool and aloof at school, but she became wild and flushed with desire when she was with Brandon.
I held Olivia's hand, and she smiled at me tenderly.
I firmly believed I hadn't misjudged her.

Before leaving, Brandon kept his eyes fixed intently on Olivia.
I observed Olivia's expression. She seemed completely oblivious to Brandon, her attention fully focused on me.
After we left the café, I accompanied Olivia to the sports field.
She had plans to play badminton with some friends, while I sat on the sidelines holding her jacket and watching.
Olivia exuded a uniquely feminine charm. Her aura was completely different from Emma's - she was bold and uninhibited, like the June sun, bringing joy to those around her.
Being with Olivia was actually the result of my careful planning.
On the first day of college, I had noticed Olivia. At the time, she saw a guy taking advantage of the crowded hallway to grope a girl. Olivia immediately pinned the guy to the ground and beat him up.
I still remember she was wearing a black t-shirt that day, with a silver necklace around her neck. She had her jacket slung casually over one shoulder as she walked past me with an indifferent expression.
My first impression was that she was carefree and rebellious, with an innate bad girl vibe that deeply attracted me.
Brandon had taught me that women like her were usually harder to pursue. Pestering them didn't work - the key was using the right approach.
Throughout freshman year, I didn't make any aggressive moves. I just tried to become a familiar face to her. Sophomore year, I started messaging her frequently and occasionally asking her to hang out.
To understand her likes and interests, I did a lot of research. Gradually, we started chatting more and more, eventually progressing to daily good morning and goodnight texts. The flirting intensified to the extreme, and we were just one step away from a relationship.
My agreement to be Emma's fake boyfriend to ward off other guys was what finally broke through that last barrier.
That night when Olivia called me out with red-rimmed eyes, demanding to know why I was with another girl, I knew my strategy of playing hard to get had worked.
When Emma was stolen by Brandon, it was the perfect opportunity for Olivia and me to get together.
She was an excellent girlfriend. In the month we'd been dating, she fulfilled the role to the utmost. Even my roommates said they never imagined a girl like Olivia could be so devoted when she fell in love.
Of course, I believed in Olivia's feelings for me. But I didn't know if she could resist the temptation of a mature man like Brandon.
A cheer erupted from the crowd - Olivia had scored another winning shot.
After spiking the final point, she walked towards me. The sunlight shone on her, giving her smile a golden glow.
Olivia grinned and said, "Bored of waiting? I'll treat you to something delicious later."
I smiled brightly back. "Sounds good."
We held hands as we walked along the edge of the sports field. The warm light shone on us, and I could feel the gentle pressure of her hand in mine.
I wished this moment could last forever.

As I had expected, Brandon finally made his move.
Recently, Brandon had been coming to campus to see me much more frequently than before.
Olivia would come to my dorm every day to walk me to breakfast, attend classes together, and go on dates.
But lately, several times when I went downstairs, I saw Brandon waiting with Olivia. From a distance, Brandon was smiling brightly. Though Olivia's expression remained neutral, she occasionally responded to him.
Brandon seemed oblivious to his third wheel status, forcibly inserting himself into Olivia and my world.
One day, Brandon suddenly invited me to dinner and specifically asked me to bring Olivia.
I knew what he was up to, but I still asked Olivia to come with me.
When Olivia and I arrived, Brandon was already waiting in the private room.
He looked like he had dressed up carefully. Was his intention really that obvious?
I brought Olivia because I had my own agenda. I wanted to see if she could resist the temptation of a man like Brandon.
"Olivia, I heard you're amazing at badminton. Could you teach me sometime?" Brandon asked in his magnetic voice.
Olivia replied flatly, "If you really want to learn, you should find a coach."
Brandon was clearly dissatisfied with Olivia's attitude, but it seemed to excite him even more.
"Finding a coach is such a hassle. You're my brother's girlfriend, so why can't I just ask you?"
I stirred my soup with a spoon, listening to Olivia's cold voice beside me.
"You know very well I'm your brother's girlfriend. It's inappropriate."
Seeing Brandon's visibly paled expression, I could barely hold back my laughter.
Brandon rarely struck out with women. Aside from that one time five years ago, this was probably only the second time.
I must have been smiling too obviously, because Brandon shot me an annoyed glare. My hand slipped and I said, "Oops, I dropped my fork."
With that, I immediately bent down to pick it up.
They clearly didn't have time to react. In the split second I lowered my head, I still saw Brandon's foot that he hadn't managed to pull back in time.
Yes, just moments ago when I wasn't paying attention, Brandon had stretched his foot towards Olivia, even between her legs...
Olivia hadn't refused.
Was it because she didn't have time to, or because she didn't want to refuse?
