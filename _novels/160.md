Just after class ended, news spread like wildfire—everyone knew I was diagnosed with AIDS. The test results were positive, and I was left speechless. In the span of a single day, I had gone from being a respected teacher to being branded as morally corrupt.

When I sought my husband's help to clear my name, his family mocked me: "Lydia, how can you even show your face outside? Every place you've been needs to be disinfected. No one dares to step there."

"Who knows what you've been up to to catch such a disease? It's disgusting."

"What else could it be? A chaotic private life, perhaps. Who would've thought Lydia had such habits, not even settling down after marriage."

Behind the door, Asher quickly posted several more messages using a fake account, muttering, "Vera finally got a chance to substitute, but she insists on teaching herself. She's showing off and needs to learn a lesson."

Only now do I realize that the man who claimed to love only me had long since changed his heart. I touched my abdomen, realizing this child had come at the worst possible time.

"Our store strictly refuses service to AIDS patients. If you're sick, stay away of your own accord, have some decency, and don't harm others!"

"If she accidentally cuts herself and touches something, others might get infected too. Oh my God, people like her shouldn't even leave their homes!"

The most liked comment read: "She's a teacher—anyone with kids at that school should be cautious!"

I knew this was posted by Asher. His intentions were clear—he wanted me out of the school to appease Vera's anger.

The overwhelming online insults and accusations left me numb. I couldn't even cry. In despair, I looked up at the sky, contemplating scheduling an abortion at the hospital. But as soon as I stepped out of the school gates, a group of parents rushed toward me, pelting me with stones.

"Does someone like you deserve to be a teacher? Teaching with AIDS?"

"Everyone knows how you got this disease. Don't corrupt my kids. If anything happens to them, I'll kill you!"

Already in a daze, a parent slapped me across the face. Unable to dodge, her long nails scratched my face, drawing blood.

"Oh my God, I've made her bleed! It's transmitted through blood; am I infected?"

"Panic ensued as people shouted, 'Go get a blocking shot at the hospital!'"

Despite the chaos, I tried to stay calm and shouted, "Those are all rumors online. I don't have the disease; someone framed me."

But no one believed me. The attacks grew more intense.

"If you claim it's slander, why aren't they slandering others but you?"

"Exactly, with the diagnosis out, you're still lying. You're really twisted, trying to make others suffer because you're sick, deliberately retaliating against society!"

The woman who scratched me fainted from fear. Her husband dialed emergency services while hurling a brick at me.

"I swear, if my wife gets infected, I'll kill you, you scum, to avenge her!"

His words resonated with everyone. They threw more things at me, and I struggled to fend them off.

"If you don't leave the school, I'll complain to the Principal, to the Department of Education. We'll sue you for malicious virus spreading!"

I curled up in a corner, holding my head, too scared to make a sound. The physical and emotional pain intertwined, leaving me a mess.

Just then, Asher rushed over, shielding me behind him. "You're pregnant and still running around. If anything happens to you or the baby, what am I supposed to do?"

Vera appeared behind him, intentionally unbuttoning two buttons on her blouse. The red kiss marks were clearly visible. "Lydia, are you okay? Asher is worried about your health. I'll take over your classes, so you can rest at home."

Due to this incident, my classes were already suspended, and I didn't expect Vera to take over. Since they dislike me and like to take my things, I'll just disappear completely and not show up in front of them.

Looking at Vera's meticulously made-up face, while I was covered in blood and dirt, I felt pathetic and ugly.

I was about to leave, but Asher grabbed me, then disgustedly released his hand when he saw how dirty I was.

"Vera's lesson plan isn't ready. You should guide her."

Seeing Vera's fake smile, my chest felt heavy with anger.

"I'm suspended. It's not my job."

Asher's concern vanished, and he frowned impatiently. "You're more experienced than her. What's wrong with helping out? It's decided."

He wasn't asking for my opinion; he just made the decision for me. He dragged me to an abandoned classroom, pushing me inside and locking the door before I could react.

---

The students had left, and the teachers were off work. Even in the daytime, no one would come to this abandoned classroom. I sensed danger and tried to escape, but a force grabbed my collar.

I turned to see a man reeking of stench, drooling as he approached. "What are you doing? This is a school!"

He sneered at me, his eyes full of mockery. "You're the woman with AIDS, right? You look cheap. Did you catch it from too many men outside?"

"But I don't mind. I have AIDS too. Infected ten people this month. Since you're already sick, let's have some fun."

He reached out with his filthy hand. I kept banging on the door, hoping someone would hear and save me.

Outside, I heard Vera's coy voice. "Asher, how long are you going to stay with this cheap woman? It makes me uncomfortable knowing she's your wife. And a backbone teacher? Does she deserve it?"

Asher chuckled lightly. "After this, she's nothing. Just a rat everyone beats. She'll lose her job for sure."

"She has nothing on you. She's ugly. Best if she never leaves the house again, saves everyone the embarrassment."

Behind the door, I felt his disdain. Suddenly, the man behind me yanked my hair, forcing me to look up. His stinking mouth approached my face.

"Help!"

I shouted, but he covered my mouth, his other hand pulling at my pants. Just as he was about to succeed, the door flew open.

I ran out with all my strength, trying to call for help, but people already crowded the doorway. The man immediately pointed at me in panic, cursing.

"This cheap woman seduced me, trying to infect me. She blocked the door so I couldn't escape!"

He twisted the truth, and everyone believed him, glaring at me. An old woman rushed over, slapping my face repeatedly.

"You shameless slut, seducing my son with AIDS! My son isn't even married. Do you want us to be childless?"

"People like you should be arrested. I'm calling the police! Police!"

The Principal rushed over, seeing the scene, felt ashamed, and coldly issued an ultimatum.

"Lydia, you're fired. Leave our school immediately!"

After the Principal left, Asher's friends gave me disdainful looks.

"Lydia, really? Catching a disease and wanting revenge on society? You'd even go for a beggar or homeless man?"

"Seriously, just go to the hospital for isolation or stay home. You're already affecting our normal lives."

Asher pretended to arrive just then, pulling me out of the crowd.

"You..."

He pointed at me, speechless, looking pained and pitiful, earning sympathy.

"Wife, I've been busy with work and haven't been with you. But that's no excuse for your behavior! What have you done?"

He acted convincingly, playing the clueless, heartbroken good husband. His words made everyone understand one thing.

I'm a restless woman fooling around, and my husband knew nothing. It also subtly explained that he never touched me, so he's not sick. What great acting and plotting.

Asher tried to hug me but seemed repulsed, struggling to touch me. "Wife, no matter what, we've been married. I'm on your side. We'll solve this together."

He spoke nicely. But he'd just used his small account to post everything online. Letting everyone know I was a promiscuous woman who caught AIDS. And now, I was retaliating against society, trying to infect more people.

I never knew, the seemingly dull Asher had such a sharp mind.

Everyone's accusations made him a bit embarrassed, so he awkwardly looked at me.

"Wife, there's a party tonight for Vera's new job. It's all familiar faces. Why not use this chance to apologize on video, and it'll be over."

I looked at him in disbelief, wondering why I had to apologize when I did nothing wrong. And attending this party would make me a bigger target.

"No, I'm going home."

"Lydia!"

Asher called out, his eyes full of reproach, all his words defending Vera.

"Don't overthink. Vera got the job because of her real talent. I just want the school to do better."

"Honey, we're celebrating Vera joining tonight. It's just people we know, so why not take this opportunity to apologize in a Snapchat message and let this whole thing blow over?"

I looked at him in surprise, not understanding why I should apologize when I did nothing wrong. If I went to this gathering, I'd just be setting myself up for more scrutiny.

"No, I'm going home."

"Lydia!"

Asher called after me, his eyes full of reproach, and his words all in defense of Vera.

"Stop imagining things. Vera got the substitute teacher position because she's genuinely talented. I'm doing this for the School's benefit."

I hadn't said a word, yet he was assuming all sorts of things. Every word was defending Vera, making me out to be petty.

But I lost my job due to all the overwhelming slander and was exhausted, both mentally and physically. He acted as if nothing happened, even wanting to push me further into despair.

In the end, Asher dragged me to the gathering by force. As soon as everyone saw me, they acted as if they'd seen a ghost, avoiding me as if I were contagious.

It was like being near me was a threat to their lives.

"I heard AIDS doesn't spread through the air or saliva?"

"Can you guarantee she doesn't have any mouth ulcers? I heard people with AIDS have their whole body rot!"

"Then stay far away; it's really scary."

Hearing their words, I saw a smug glint in Vera's eyes. Then she pouted, "We're all friends here, don't be so harsh. She's still here, give her some dignity."

With that, she pretended to offer me some food. But Asher immediately blocked her chopsticks, keeping her away from me. His protectiveness over Vera was truly something else.

To outsiders, this move made it seem like even serving me food could lead to infection, and Asher was protecting Vera.

Then, a waiter, wearing gloves and a mask, brought me a bowl of some unknown concoction on a tray.
