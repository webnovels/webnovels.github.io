Chapter 1

I'd just finished my discharge paperwork when I saw Casper Hale in the hospital courtyard. Sasha Lynch was leaning against him, barely able to hold herself up, the two of them talking in hushed voices.

Then, they noticed me, and Casper's smile dropped instantly. He stepped in front of Sasha, shielding her like he expected me to hurt her.

"What brings you here?" he asked.

The wariness in his gaze sent a cold ripple down my spine.

Sasha tugged gently at his sleeve. "Cas, don't frighten Lis like that."

Before I could answer, she turned to me with an apologetic look. "Lis, please don't get the wrong idea. I got hurt, so Cas is just worried about me."

Casper turned to murmur something reassuring to her, but the second his eyes flicked back to me, his irritation was plain. "What do you want?"

I opened my mouth to speak, then thought better of it and shook my head. "Nothing. I was only passing by."

Casper must've sensed something wasn't right. He took a step closer, his voice unusually soft. "You should head home if there's nothing else. Be careful—especially now, since you're expecting."

Behind him, Sasha glared at me, her face tight with irritation.

I gave a small nod. "I understand."

Casper turned to leave with Sasha. Now her face was full of triumph.

I turned away, my hands settling on my stomach as a deep ache rose inside me. My husband was walking away with another woman. He didn't know I had already lost our baby.

He would've known the truth if he'd just glanced back that day or visited me in the hospital.

I let out a self-deprecating smile. Then, I felt the glass jar in my pocket. My fingers tightened around it as memories rushed in.

The only time Casper ever went with me to the hospital was the day his first love found him. After that, he stopped coming home. He barely even showed up at work, spending all his time with her instead.

My eyes were red from crying when I begged him to spend just one day with me.

But he only said, "Sasha's always been fragile, and now she's hurt and lost her memory. She needs me right now. Don't worry. It's just until she recovers. Nothing else."

Casper promised he'd only help her with 99 wishes. Once those wishes were done, he'd return to me for good. That was when he'd finally keep his old promise—the one to stay with me forever.

Every time he made one of Sasha's wishes come true, I folded a paper star. Seven days ago, I finished the 99th one.

Casper could give Sasha 99 wishes. Would he grant me just one in exchange for all my stars?

I ran to him excitedly, holding the jar tight, only to find him and Sasha wrapped in an embrace. A birthday cake sat on the table, its candles already out.

Then, I heard Casper's soft voice as he said, "I'll make sure every one of your wishes comes true. No matter how many there are, I'll never say no."

I didn't know how I ended up standing in front of them. Right then, nothing else mattered except getting my answer.

My voice wavered just a touch as I asked, "What are you doing?"

As soon as Casper heard me, he let go of Sasha, his eyes flashing with panic. "Lisette, what are you doing here? It's not what it looks like. We weren't—"

Sasha cut him off, tears spilling down her cheeks as she turned to me with a pitiful look, "Lis, please don't get the wrong idea. Cas was just helping me with my wish."

Casper gently comforted Sasha. When his eyes met mine again, they were filled with accusation.

I spoke before he could, "Sorry for interrupting."

I turned and left without a second glance. But I was in such a rush that I didn't notice the truck heading straight for me. It slammed into me, sending me flying onto the pavement.

I expected Casper to come after me, but as I lay there, all I saw was him holding Sasha—she'd cried herself unconscious—while he called for an ambulance.

Later, I was simply loaded into one that happened to be close by. Meanwhile, Casper had already taken Sasha to the hospital himself.

When I woke up later, the doctors told me I'd lost the baby. All I had left were tears and this hollow, aching grief.

I decided to set myself free by stepping aside and letting Casper and Sasha be together.
