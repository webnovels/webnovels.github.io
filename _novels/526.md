The day I paid cash for our marital home, my boyfriend let his 'one that got away' move into our bedroom. He even packed up my things and tossed them outside like trash.

"Seraphina needs to smell my scent to fall asleep. She can't handle stimulation. Can't you just give in a little?"

My boyfriend locked me out, and I dragged my luggage through the streets, drenched in rain.

A Maybach pulled up beside me. The window rolled down, revealing deep, captivating eyes behind dark sunglasses, twinkling with a mocking smirk.

"Need a hand, gorgeous?"

I was reborn.

Reborn on the very day I paid cash for the marital home with my boyfriend.

This time, I wasn't stupid enough to put his name on the deed.

After the paperwork was done, I tucked the front door key into the most hidden pocket of my bag.

Then, I went home.

Outside the door, a suitcase sat alongside several large bags of my belongings.

I inserted the key, twisted it.

Just as I expected, the door was double-locked from the inside.
