Seven days before the wedding, my fiancé, my childhood sweetheart, proposed to the impoverished student he'd been sponsoring.

I didn't cry, didn't make a scene. I simply stood there, in front of everyone, and wished them eternal happiness.

His buddies tried to persuade me to be generous, to fulfill Chloe Miller's long-held wish.

He, Ryan Sullivan, was furious, accusing me of blowing things totally out of proportion. He glared, his eyes ice cold, practically daring me to beg for forgiveness.

He looked down at me, condescendingly, and said, "I told you I'd come back and marry you after I helped Chloe finish everything on her wish list. You haven't been good."

I knew. That was the last wish.

I deleted those thirty-three wishes from my notes, my heart finally dead.

Then, I dialed a number. "I'm willing to marry you."
