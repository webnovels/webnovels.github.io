I was up almost all night, preparing the documents I needed to finalize everything.

At breakfast, Alex came downstairs, prayer beads in hand, back to his usual aloof, disciplined self. He walked past me, not even bothering to spare me a glance.

"Alex."

He didn't stop. I followed him, and he was just putting on his shoes. He naturally extended his arms, expecting me to help him with his jacket.

 When he turned his head and saw my hands were empty, he frowned.

 "I'll be busy today." His voice was tinged with annoyance. "Don't cause trouble."

A sharp pang went through my heart. How much did he really despise me?

I reached for his jacket and handed it to him. "I'm not going to the office today. I'm taking the afternoon meeting off."

Alex finally deigned to give me a look. "Something else going on?"

I just hummed in response.

He nodded dismissively. "Go have fun. It doesn't matter if you come to the office or not."

I gave a self-deprecating laugh. "What if it's not 'fun'?"

But he was already out the door. My answer wasn't something he cared to hear.

With Vivian's connections, my relocation back home went incredibly smoothly. All that was left was to wait.

It was still early, so I went straight to the office to pack up my belongings. 

As I was leaving, I ran into Alex and a group of his friends. Over the years, even though I hadn't managed to charm Alex, I had gotten quite close to his circle.

They practically dragged me into their gathering. 

When I was pushed close to Alex, he gave me a brief, indifferent glance.

 "So that's your game plan." He shifted away, casually brushing the sleeve I had touched.

I was speechless. It seemed no matter what I did, he would always assume the worst.

At the bar, I had just poured myself a full glass of whiskey when Leo, Alex's assistant, quietly reminded me: "Mrs. Gray, didn't you forget Mr. Gray hates it when women drink? You've been sober for years. What's gotten into you today?"

I gave a faint smile. "I'm just craving it."

The liquor slid down my throat, igniting a fire that warmed my frozen heart.

 Fueled by alcohol, I felt like I was finding some part of my old self again.

 I slipped into the dance floor with the crowd, swaying to the music. A few handsome guys approached me.

 I not only matched their moves but even hooked a finger under one of their chins.

Maya, my best friend, who I'd called earlier, walked in just in time to see this. She gasped, rushed onto the dance floor, and dragged me out.

"Aubrey Gray, are you out of your mind?! Alex is right there at the VIP table, watching!"

"Dancing like that, flirting with guys—aren't you worried he'll give you hell when you get home?"

How ridiculous. When had Alex ever given me a good look?

From the VIP table behind us, a friend said to Alex, "Are the newlyweds fighting? Is Aubrey mad you won't make your relationship public?"

"Honestly, you two have been married for four or five years now. You really should give Aubrey a proper title when you go back home."

Alex took a sip of his drink. "She doesn't care."

His words were like daggers, stabbing my heart. 

How could I not care? I’d forced myself to stay abroad all these years for him.

 My family had asked countless times who he was, but Alex never bothered, leaving me to face them alone.

His friend chuckled again. "Aubrey's got plenty of handsome guys around her. Aren't you worried about getting cuckolded?"

Alex answered casually, "She won't."

He was so certain, I almost laughed out loud. 

Maybe Alex knew how much I loved him, how he thought I wouldn't dare to cross the line. Or perhaps, he just didn't care at all.

Alex's eyes scanned the room for something. Suddenly, he stood up. He quickly moved through the crowd, stopping in front of a girl.

It was Chloe.

Of course. That's why he, who usually despised nightclubs, had agreed to this party.
