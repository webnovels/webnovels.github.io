Alex didn't leave. Instead, he stayed, saying he wanted to take care of me. 

It was the first time he'd ever softened, claiming he meant well but messed up, even buying a cake to apologize.

If this had happened before, I don't know how ecstatic I would have been.

 I would have said it was fine, and even taken some blame myself. I had loved him so humbly, I'd forgotten who I truly was.

But now, I was awake. Whatever he did, my heart felt nothing. Perhaps the pain had been too intense before, making it easy to let go now.

When I was discharged and returned home, I found Chloe sprawled on the couch, playing on her phone.

 Hearing us enter, she sprang up and threw herself into Alex's arms. 

Her long legs wrapped around his waist, and her arms hooked his neck as she whined, "Uncle Alex, you're finally home! I missed you so much."

Alex's eyes softened. "Still acting like a child at your age." Yet, his hands were firmly supporting Chloe's thighs, with no intention of letting go.

I walked past them expressionlessly. Only then did Alex put Chloe down. He whispered something softly to her.

Chloe turned to me as I was heading upstairs. "Auntie, I'm sorry about the other day."

It was a perfunctory apology, but Alex seemed satisfied. He patted her head and said to me, "Chloe will be moving in with us."

"She's old enough now, and it's not safe for her to be out alone."

What wasn't safe about a college dorm? He was just jealous that day and wanted to keep Chloe under his watchful eye. 

But I had no intention of exposing his twisted thoughts. I was leaving soon anyway; I didn't want any more complications.

But Chloe wasn't quiet. She paraded around the house every day in tank tops and hot pants. 

Alex tried to endure it, but his eyes would inevitably latch onto her.

The difference between love and not love was so obvious. As soon as Chloe beckoned, the aloof "monk" would immediately fall to earth, experiencing human joys and sorrows.

One night, after Chloe had too much to drink, Alex dragged her home from a club.

 I was woken by the noise and went to the kitchen for water.

 That's when I saw them, tightly embracing at the end of the hallway. 

Chloe was hazy with intoxication, calling Alex's name: "Alex, don't ignore me. Chloe's been a good girl, hold me…"

Her hands cupped Alex's face. With every breath, Alex's self-control completely shattered.

 He furiously kissed Chloe's lips, his hand clutching the back of her head. 

Years of restraint were unleashed in that moment.

I retreated back into my room, realizing my face was already streaked with cold tears.

 I thought I wouldn't cry anymore, but remembering all the small moments from these years…

I truly felt… so wronged.

The next morning, I handed a stack of papers to Alex, who was peeling a boiled egg for Chloe. "Sign these."

Alex took the pen, asking, "What are they?"

Chloe glanced at me and started whining, "Uncle Alex, I'm hungry."

I lowered my eyes, trying to sound natural. "Just some reimbursement forms. Nothing too important."

Alex didn't suspect anything. He quickly signed, then went back to serving Chloe her breakfast. I took the documents and left the house, looking at the flourish of three words on the divorce papers. A sudden sense of immense relief washed over me.

It was finally, truly over.
