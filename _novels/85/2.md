Running like mad, my roommate panted heavily beside me.

"Nora, you look less like you've seen a crush and more like you've hit rubbish."

Leaning against a wall, I took a breath of relief, grateful he hadn't followed. Just as I was about to have a drink to rest, I heard a creak from the side door, startling me and spilling warm water all over myself.

A muscular arm blocked my chest, "Are you okay? Here, take this shirt."

I was about to accept it, but that familiar voice, it was him!

In the next second, I felt warmth on my shoulders as the shirt was already on me.

Just as I was about to run, someone grabbed my neck.

I had no choice but to give up; it seemed like there was no escaping today.

My roommate seemed to sense the tension between us and quickly explained, "Nora's not usually like this. She might be possessed today. I'll figure it out."

Then she ran off, leaving just Asher and me staring at each other.

Before I could calm down, a sudden pain shot through my chin.

He lifted my chin with his right hand, making me look into his dark eyes.

"Long time no see, my sweetheart."

My brain buzzed, and my face instantly turned red.

So, he already knew who I was!

"I don't want..."

He blocked my escape route, leaning down close to my ear.

"What don't you want?" His voice was magnetic and alluring.
