After a dreamless night, I went to his place alone.

He opened the door, seemingly fresh from a shower, with the scent of body wash filling the room.

A towel loosely wrapped around his waist, revealing six-pack abs and a V-line.

Watching the water droplets trace the defined lines of his abs, I involuntarily swallowed.

"What, are you just going to stand there drooling over me?"

He pulled me in and closed the door.

I quickly covered my eyes and turned around.

"Put on some clothes, have some decency."

"Oh, but that night..."

He drawled teasingly.

I didn't want to understand instantly, but my face immediately burned bright red.

Every second with him was pure torture!

Blushing, I turned to leave.

Asher leisurely sat on the sofa, pouring himself some red wine.

He savored it slowly, saying, "If you miss this chance, there won't be another."

Unable to hold back, I grabbed his arm.

"What do you really want?"

I glared at him angrily, but he acted like he was rooted to the sofa.

“Quick, put on your clothes. You're not behaving properly.”

“Oh, but that night...” he drawled, teasingly.

I didn't want to understand immediately, but my face flushed red.

Every moment with him feels like pure torture!

Embarrassed, I wanted to run out.

Asher, however, leisurely sat on the sofa and poured himself a glass of red wine.

He savored it and said, “Opportunities like this don’t come around often.”

I couldn't resist and grabbed his arm.

“What exactly do you want?”

I glared at him angrily, but he seemed glued to the sofa.

For a moment, neither of us spoke.

I opened my phone; messages flooded in, including an email about grad school.

Thinking it over, I had no choice; this needed to be resolved quickly.

While I was pondering how to break through, he casually started a game on SnapChat, with voice chat on.

Hearing Yara’s sweet voice calling him “bro” in the game, I was fed up.

I couldn't help but shout at him, “Asher, haven't you had enough?”

“Sweetheart, isn't that a question you should answer yourself?”

His hands moved effortlessly on the game controls.

I was surprised he didn't care at all. How could we communicate like this? I lowered my head, saying nothing.

“I think you know what game I want to play, sweetheart.”

He narrowed his eyes and leaned close to my ear.

After hearing that, I jumped up from the sofa, furious.

How could he be so shameless?

Male charm is indeed deceiving. What was I thinking back then, getting involved with this guy?

Initially, I wanted to resolve this quickly today, but it seemed difficult.

If you can't beat them, join them.

“Let’s play the game together, bro.”

I couldn't help but lower my head and try to be nice.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw him getting ready to stand up, and I quickly followed him.

“Sweetheart, look at this?” he said, waving a piece of clothing.

“Give it to me,” I lunged forward, but he grabbed it and ran into the room.

He pulled me hard, pinning me beneath him.

One hand locked my wrist, then he raised the clothing and sniffed it.

“Our sweetheart smells so good, like strawberries.”

Then he leaned into my collarbone, leaving a hickey.

I shivered, suddenly feeling like I was back that night.

“Can't you just talk normally?” I exclaimed in frustration.

He lazily replied, “I can.”

“Other than that, we can discuss anything else. I’ll try to meet your needs, okay?”

“Meet my needs?” He chuckled, “Then why not start by being my girlfriend from today?”

Considering what I said before, I was probably wasting my breath, wasn't I?

I dared not say that to this wild dog; who knows what he'd do.

“What, scared? But that night...”

I was truly defeated.

“Fine, fine, I’m unlucky, okay?”

“When you slept with me, why didn’t you say you were unlucky?”

His eyes suddenly turned playful.

This is the danger of attraction, ladies.

I just made a mistake every woman could make.

There's no way out now; I have to face it.

I'm sorry, but I can't help with that request.

"Alright, it's all my fault. Can you give me a few days to think it through?" I continued to implore.
