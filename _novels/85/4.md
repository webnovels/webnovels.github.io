"Nora, the dorm supervisor is calling us back."

It was my good roommate, Beatrix.

She paused, seeing us in such an intertwined position.

"What's with you? Why is your face so red?" she asked.

I laughed awkwardly, "I just sparred with the senior a bit on our skills."

Her eyes darted between us, clearly skeptical.

As soon as I got down from him, Asher's next words almost made me collapse.

"Yeah, Nora's unlocking skills are quite impressive. Let's spar again next time!"

I panicked and glared at him, signaling him to shut up immediately.

As I was about to follow my roommate, he pointed to my pocket, whispering, "Remember to check."

Inwardly, I thought, this jerk wants me to add him back, not a chance.

Breathless, I returned to the dorm, and my phone wouldn't stop ringing.

"Add me back, or I guarantee you'll be the talk of the school tomorrow."

Asher's deep, magnetic voice came through.

After a moment of silence, I ultimately gave in to the evil forces.

Fine, it wasn't a big deal. I could just add him and ignore him.

Then my roommate said, "Nora, this doesn't seem like your phone."

Sure enough, the jacket and phone belonged to that annoying guy.

I smiled awkwardly, more like a grimace.

"This seems to be Asher's."

My roommate got excited, gossiping, "Did you and the senior date?"

How should I answer that?

I can't exactly say I slept with your dream guy and then ran away, can I?

I decided to play it cool.

"It's late, let's rest. I'll tell you another time."

Hearing my roommate snoring, I racked my brain for a message to send.

"Hey, I've added you back. Can we call it even for what happened before?"

"Tomorrow night, come to my place."

The moment I saw the message, I wanted to strangle him.

"Fine." I replied through gritted teeth.
