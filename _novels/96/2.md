Back in my seat, I couldn't help but tear up.

All of James's past kindnesses now seemed distorted, unable to withstand scrutiny.

Faced with his entire family, I still had to make excuses for him and comfort them. What sin had I committed to deserve such torment?

"Miss, do you know the passenger who was supposed to sit next to you? They checked in but didn't board. Our plane is about to take off..."

A pleasant male voice sounded beside me. I looked up with teary eyes at him, suddenly feeling emotionally overwhelmed.

"He... left."

The flight attendant panicked and hurriedly offered me tissues.

"Left?"

"Yes, he... just left."

My anger, grievance, and heartache completely overflowed at that moment.

"I'm... so sorry for your loss. If you need anything, please don't hesitate to ask."

The flight attendant looked at me with sympathy and surprise. Only then did I realize how ugly my crying must have been, leading him to misunderstand the situation entirely.

The flight attendant was exceptionally attentive to us throughout the flight, giving James's father an extra meal and even gifting James's little niece with an airline mascot toy.

As we were disembarking, I wanted to thank the flight attendant, but seeing him coldly refuse a female passenger who asked for a photo with him, I just quietly followed the crowd off the plane.

I might as well consider James dead. Thinking this way, I actually felt a bit better.
