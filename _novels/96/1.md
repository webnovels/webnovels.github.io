James had always been attentive to detail, while I tended to be more carefree.

During our three-year relationship, he pampered me like a child.

He remembered my menstrual cycle, all my food allergies, would warm my cold feet on his thighs when we slept in winter, and in summer, he'd drowsily cover me with a blanket in the middle of the night to prevent me from catching a chill.

Our friends, seeing how he'd hold my hand even when crossing the street, urged us to get married and have kids soon, telling us to stop showing off and experience the hardships of married life.

James would laugh and pull me close.

"Even if we get married and have kids, Sophia won't suffer one bit. We'll book the best private hospital and the best postpartum care center."

During a long weekend, James wanted to introduce me to his family and had arranged an international family trip.

They say that traveling together before marriage is the best test for a relationship. All flaws are magnified during a trip, and you'll know if you can make it work after just one try.

I was even more nervous about being tested along with his whole family.

But James assured me that I didn't need to worry about anything, just focus on looking beautiful, and he would take care of everything else. Only then did I feel at ease.

The night before our departure, he tossed and turned, unable to sleep. I thought he was worried about overlooking something in the arrangements, so I gently patted him, but he said nothing, just let out a long sigh.

At the airport, after meeting up with all his family members, he still seemed distracted, checking his phone every few minutes.

James's sister and brother-in-law had already gone through the boarding gate with their little daughter. I tugged on James's sleeve, signaling him to show our tickets.

Instead, he pulled me aside.

"I'm sorry, Sophia. I can't go. Please take care of my family for me."

Even as his running figure disappeared from view, I couldn't process what had just happened.

For the past three years, no matter when I messaged James, he always replied instantly.

But this time, he didn't answer my calls or respond to my messages. He didn't even offer a proper explanation.

What was going on? I was so angry that tears welled up in my eyes.

"Ma'am, the boarding gate is about to close. Please board quickly."

This was James's parents' first trip abroad, and his sister had a three-year-old child with her. I couldn't imagine how panicked this family would be in a foreign country, so I had no choice but to go ahead and board.

As I walked across the jet bridge, my phone buzzed. I thought it was James, but when I opened it, I saw it was a message from my best friend, Olivia.

"Did you know James's first love, Nora, is back in the country? I heard she has a terminal illness and came back for treatment."

"Hey, I'm just gossiping with you. James is so good to you, whether she's back or not shouldn't affect your relationship."

Reading these lines, I took a deep breath, my hand trembling slightly.

Thinking back on James's recent strange behavior, everything suddenly made sense.

My boyfriend, who had always showered me with affection, had abandoned his entire family and left them with me, all for his first love.

James, who was usually so meticulous in his interactions with others, had done something so outrageous.

I couldn't help but steady myself against the nearby handrail, suddenly feeling dizzy.

Once on the plane, faced with James's waiting family, I hurriedly made up an excuse, saying James had an urgent matter at work.

His mother seemed displeased.

"Sophia, dear, why didn't you try to persuade our James to stay? It's a holiday, and we finally got to go on a trip together. He works too hard."

"If James isn't going, what's the point of us going?"

I was taken aback. James probably couldn't face me, not even offering an explanation, let alone giving me a chance to persuade him.

The cabin door had already closed, and nearby passengers, hearing their conversation, began to whisper worriedly, concerned it might delay the takeoff.

"When we finally get to go on a trip, we should try to overcome any obstacles and enjoy ourselves as much as possible."

I said this to James's mother, but I was also saying it to myself.
