Leading this big family through immigration, with the elderly complaining about the long wait and the little one crying from hunger, was overwhelming.

All the things James said I wouldn't need to worry about now fell on my shoulders, leaving me feeling utterly helpless with nowhere to vent my frustrations.

When I received Olivia's call, my mind was in a fog.

"Sophia, why did it take you so long to answer? Is James with you? Have you seen Nora's Instagram post?"

"That person in the photo looks a lot like James!"

Urged by Olivia, I hung up and checked Nora's Instagram post.

In the photo, there was a stark white hospital room with flowers and a card on the table. In the blurred background was a figure I knew all too well.

Nora's caption read: "The doctor asked what regrets I had in life. I made a long bucket list. But when I see the moonlight on your brow, with you by my side, what regrets could I possibly have?"

In the comments, Nora's readers expressed concern about her condition.

Some began to speculate about Nora's love life, guessing who the person in the photo might be.

I sent Olivia a message.

"I've seen the photo. It's probably my soon-to-be ex-boyfriend, James."

We had once promised each other that even if we argued, it wouldn't last more than a day. We would communicate clearly about any issues and never resort to the silent treatment.

But in the days since we left, James hadn't contacted me at all.

James wasn't answering his parents' calls either, only sending them brief messages saying he was busy with work and would explain everything when he got back.

His uncle and aunt were worried but didn't want to say much. His sister pulled me aside.

"Sophia, tell me the truth. What's really going on between you and James? Did you two have a fight?"

"James went to the hospital to take care of Nora."

"What? They broke up years ago! This is ridiculous!"

Right in front of me, his sister dialed James's number, but after a few rings, the call was disconnected.

I gave a bitter smile. Perhaps he was also feeling guilty and couldn't face his family's questions.

Ever since I started thinking of James as my deceased ex-boyfriend, I felt a touch of pity when looking at his family members.

It wasn't until we returned home and I led the whole family out of the arrivals area with their luggage that I saw James again.
