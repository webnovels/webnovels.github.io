In my previous life, my mother-in-law secretly had a daughter with another man, unbeknownst to my father-in-law.

She knelt down and pleaded with me to treat this child as if she were a twin sister to my own.

I hesitated but eventually agreed.

Later on, the child developed kidney failure.

My husband was a compatible donor, but my mother-in-law refused to let him donate a kidney.

The child passed away, and only after her death did I discover she was actually my child.

When I confronted my mother-in-law upon learning the truth, she pushed me down the stairs, leading to my tragic demise.

I opened my eyes to find myself back at the moment when my mother-in-law was begging me.
