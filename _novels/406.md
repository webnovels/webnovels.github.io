Caleb Thompson and I had been in love for ten years. Then, right before our wedding, he suddenly vanished without a trace.

The next time I saw him, he was sweetly holding hands with another woman.

He told me he was on an undercover mission, that the woman was just his target, and I was the only true love of his life.

Later, when the mission ended, he blocked her everywhere and came home to marry me.

For six years, our life together was blissful. I had long forgotten about the past, until I went to file some official paperwork.

“Ms. Hayes, our records indicate you are still unmarried.”

Those words sent a shockwave through me.

“That’s impossible. My husband, Caleb Thompson, and I have been married for six years.”

“The system shows Mr. Thompson is indeed married, but you are not.”

“Then who is his wife?”

“Alexa Monroe.”

The very woman who was Caleb’s undercover target all those years ago.
