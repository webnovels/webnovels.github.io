The next morning, Jack entered pushing a breakfast cart.

He was wearing that light blue shirt I loved most, carrying a small bouquet of yellow lilies.

The flower meaning: Get well soon.

To me, it felt bitingly cold.

"Wendy, are you feeling better?" His voice was still so gentle, but now it made me nauseous.

"I bought the rice porridge you like."

I forced myself to squeeze out a smile.

"Much better, just the incision still hurts a bit."

Jack set down the flowers and naturally adjusted my pillow height.

This practiced feeling, as if he had done it countless times.

"Where's Emily?" I asked casually.

"Oh, she went for a follow-up check. Dr. Zhang said the transplant was very successful, she's recovering faster than expected."

I stared at him intently. He remained outwardly calm!

Even now, he was still lying to me.

If I hadn't accidentally overheard Emily's conversation with you last night, would I have been kept in the dark forever?

When he leaned in close to me, a familiar perfume scent suddenly assaulted my nostrils.

It was the fragrance Rachel always wore.

After being around her for so many years, I couldn't mistake it.

"When did you change your cologne?"

Jack visibly stiffened.

Then he nonchalantly pulled away, raising his hand to rub his shirt collar.

This motion fully exposed the faint red mark on the side of his neck.

A hickey.

In all these years, he never allowed me to kiss his neck, saying he wasn't used to it.

Later, I carefully avoided it.

"I felt like I'd gotten used to the scent of the cologne you gave me before," he said, avoiding my gaze.

"I switched to a different fragrance, I think it smells nice. I'll let you try it next time."

My gaze was fixed on his neck. That glaring mark felt like a slap across my face.

No wonder he suddenly wore such strong cologne, it was to cover this up.

"Is that so?" I said softly, my nails digging deep into my palm. "What brand is it? I've been wanting to change my perfume too."

Jack's eyes began to dart around.

"It's just... something I bought at a regular mall. I don't remember the name."

I almost laughed coldly.

He had grown tired of our relationship of over a decade, just like he'd grown tired of that bottle of cologne I gave him.

My heart felt like it was being squeezed by an invisible hand, each beat bringing pain.

The spoonful of hot porridge in my mouth, no matter how I tried to swallow, wouldn't go down.

Noticing my discomfort, he frowned slightly.

"What's wrong? Is it not to your taste? I specially went to that place you liked in South Bridge to buy it."

I suddenly gave a bitter smile.

My smile made him look at me with a hint of confusion.

You probably bought it out of convenience.

Then, I shook my head at him.

"It's nothing, I just feel like you're so good to me! If only it could always be like this!"

He looked at me adoringly, raising his hand to stroke my head as usual.

"It will be. Don't think too much, your only job now is to rest well."

I subtly dodged that hand.

That hand that had touched who knows how many people.

I turned over, pulling up the blanket.

"I'm tired, I want to rest. You should go check on Emily."

"Alright... you sleep for a bit then."

"Oh, could you bring me a fresh set of clothes from home later? I'm not used to the hospital gowns."

"Sure, I'll be back soon."

That hand hovering in mid-air finally stroked my head a few times.

I instantly widened my eyes, my scalp tingling.
