When the door slammed shut, fighting the urge to vomit, I reached for the call button by the bed, summoning a nurse.

When the nurse entered, I was vigorously wiping the hair Jack had touched with disinfectant wipes.

I only stopped when my scalp was burning with pain.

"Hello, could I see Emily Leaf's medical report and my kidney transplant report?" I asked, forcing a weak smile.

"I'm the patient's mother."

The nurse didn't suspect anything and gave me the two authentic hospital reports.

Both were ones I, the person involved, had never seen before.

The reports showed — Patient diagnosed with acute respiratory infection, otherwise normal.

What a "normal" diagnosis.

And my report at the end — signed by Rachel Song.

I took out my phone and quickly snapped a few photos for evidence.

By the time I had everything prepared, it was already evening. Jack still hadn't returned.

Home was less than 20 minutes from the hospital!! I gripped my phone tightly, my fingertips almost turning white.

Where had he gone? The answer was obvious. I still masochistically dialed that familiar number.

The call was answered after just a few rings. Laughter could be heard on the other end, mixed with a soft woman's voice.

"Wendy." Jack's voice suddenly became guilty.

The background noise instantly went quiet.

"Jack, when exactly are you going to bring me the clothes I asked for? I need them tonight." My voice was frighteningly calm.

"Emily was just clamoring to go out and buy some things. I lost track of time!"

I stared at the ceiling, my fingertips digging into my palm.

Inwardly, I laughed coldly.

This one little thing I asked you to do, you still can't manage for me now.

"Didn't Dr. Zhang say Emily needed to rest? How can she go out?"

Jack was momentarily speechless.

Until our daughter's sweet voice came through. "Mom's the best, don't blame Dad. I was the one who asked Dad to take me out."

My nails dug deep crescents into my palm.

I took a deep breath, trying hard to suppress the anger and desolation welling up inside.

"Emily, don't lie to Mom. I'll ask you one more time, did you want to go out or did Dad make you go?"

I still held a glimmer of hope for my daughter.

The other end of the line suddenly went quiet.

Then, Emily's voice became shrill.

"Mom, you don't believe me now? I'm telling you, I asked Dad to take me out!! I—"

"......."

One sentence was enough to shatter my illusions.

Before she could finish, I abruptly hung up and threw the phone forcefully onto the bed.

I lowered my head, laughing bitterly as I muttered.

"Why? I gave everything for this family. Jack is one thing, but why is even my daughter the same?!"

At this moment, I felt like a failure in marriage.

My husband, cheating midway through.

And with my best friend, no less.

My daughter, now breaking my heart.

If that's how it is, I no longer hold any illusions about them. There's no point in wasting my breath.

I raised my hand and forwarded those "evidence" that didn't quite look like evidence to my alternate social media account.

Though it didn't have many followers, it was enough to reach internet celebrity Rachel's eyes.

"Shocking! Husband conspires with daughter to fake illness, tricks wife into donating kidney to mistress!"
