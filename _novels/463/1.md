When the door closed again, I finally opened my eyes. Tears immediately blurred my vision.

I trembled as I touched the wound on my side. Beneath the bandages was where my missing right kidney had been.

I desperately needed to know some truth.

I found my phone on the bedside table. The moment the screen lit up, the lock screen photo of Emily's radiant smile stabbed at my eyes.

That child who I thought needed a kidney transplant to save her life.

Now it seemed utterly ironic.

I opened the chat history with the contact labeled "BFF".

It was full of mundane conversations.

Then I instinctively checked Rachel's social media profile. Most of it was just daily life updates, nothing unusual.

Until I saw Rachel's last post from three days ago.

"In a few days, I will welcome my new life." The photo showed her in the hospital.

But in the corner was a familiar deep black suit jacket. That was the one-of-a-kind custom-made jacket I had specially ordered for him!!

I stared at the screen, my fingertips trembling uncontrollably.

My chest felt like it was being crushed by a boulder, even breathing became difficult.

Tears kept falling from the corners of my eyes.

Why? We were all familiar with each other, all known each other for over a decade.

One was my best friend, the other my husband of 11 years.

I never imagined that the man who once revolved around me, keeping me warm and comfortable, and the daughter I was so proud of would one day deceive and betray me.

We were once the couple everyone envied from college.

I always thought we would walk hand in hand through life, growing old together.

But I never expected that after so many years of trust and companionship, it would all turn to ashes in the face of reality.

Now, he had crushed my future with his own hands.

Seeing this suit, I was almost certain Jack had cheated on me.

There was no need to torture each other anymore.

I wiped away the tears I had unknowingly shed for him all night.

I wanted a divorce from Jack.

As for Emily, I was willing to give her one more chance! Perhaps she had only been manipulated by Rachel.
