Chapter 1

"Ms. Lundy, we've prepared a replica corpse matching your specifications. It's an exact double of yourself and will be delivered to your and Mr. Hatcher's wedding in ten days."

Thea Lundy had been wound tight for days. Now, the voice on the phone brought her a hint of relief.

"Alright. Thanks," she said.

"You're welcome. We're just doing our job. And rest assured, no one will doubt the corpse's authenticity."

Thea let out a relieved sigh at the assurance. She went over the delivery details one last time before hanging up and entering a private room.

The lively conversation inside cut off abruptly when she entered.

Terrence Hatcher, seated at the center, immediately rose and took her hand, his eyes filled with concern as he signed, "Thea, you were in the restroom for so long. Are you feeling sick? Let me take you home right now."

He was about to guide her toward the door, his gaze so intensely focused on Thea that it made her heart ache.

Suppressing the tightness in her chest, she shook her head. "I'm fine. You all go on ahead."

Terrence paused, but at her insistence, he reluctantly guided her back to their seats, their fingers staying intertwined.

The room's cheerful atmosphere had barely returned when a voice cut through the chatter. "Terrence, now that you and Thea are getting married, what happens to that assistant you've been keeping around?"

Thea's nails bit into her palms as the color drained from her face.

Someone nearby elbowed the speaker. "Thea's still right here. Have some tact."

The man merely shrugged. "Relax. She can't hear anything. I'm just curious what Terrence plans to do with his side piece."

Every eye in the room turned to Terrence.

"I'm keeping her," he said.

Picking up a shrimp, he peeled it carefully before placing it on Thea's plate.

Then, he continued, "She's just entertainment I keep around. Thea's the only woman who matters to me. But she'd leave me if she found out, so I've made sure she never does—not before the wedding, not after. And let me be clear. If any of you breathe a word of this to Thea, you'll regret it."

His gaze turned steely as it swept across the room.

Everyone present moved in privileged circles where keeping mistresses was commonplace, making Terrence's declaration all the more surprising.

"Poor Terrence, can't even keep a mistress without hiding it. My wife's known about mine for years."

"Don't compare Terrence to your tawdry affairs. What he has with Thea is something real."

Eyes gleaming with salacious interest, someone asked, "Terrence, with Thea being deaf, did you and your assistant ever, you know… at home?"

He left the question deliberately unfinished, dangling it with suggestive implication.

Terrence gave a low chuckle, spinning his engagement ring absently as he replied, "Naturally. It's… thrilling."

The room exploded with cheers and approving thumbs-up gestures.

"Savage! Only you could manage this, you dog!"

"I'll bet you've christened every damn room of that house! You lucky son of a gun!"

"So, marriage won't slow down your side action at all, huh?"

The flattery rolled on, oblivious to how Thea's grip on her fork blanched her knuckles white. None of them knew about her regained hearing or her decision to leave Terrence forever.

There would be no wedding. When the day arrived, Terrence would find only a flawless replica of Thea's corpse waiting for him.
