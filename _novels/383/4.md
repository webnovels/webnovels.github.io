Damien’s eyes were bloodshot, his hands falling helplessly to his sides.

He finally snapped back to reality and pulled us into the coffee shop next door.

Seraphina, leading Stella, picked up the menu and ordered with practiced ease.

Chloe, meanwhile, looked utterly out of place.

She knew I didn't have money to pay for this meal. She looked up at me.

“Mommy, why are the cakes here so cheap?”

“How can the cakes here compare to what Stella eats in the States?”

Seraphina and Stella smirked, then Seraphina lifted her eyes to look at me.

“What would you two like to order?”

The menu was written in elegant cursive, every item a string of French words. Chloe and I stared blankly, not understanding a single thing.

Damien made a phone call, then called over a server and ordered some desserts.

Seraphina looked utterly blissful. “Damien, I can’t believe you remembered Stella and I are allergic to mango!”

“Daddy, I knew you loved Stella the most!”

Stella burrowed into Damien’s arms, showering him with affection.

Chloe sat forlornly, her head drooping.

The desserts arrived, and every single one had almond slivers.

My heart felt half-empty.

I had foolishly believed Damien would remember I didn't eat almonds.

He didn't notice my disappointed expression. He simply sent Seraphina and Stella off.

“Mr. Damien, I’m not interested in your family’s happy life. Can Chloe and I leave now?”

Hearing my words, Damien looked utterly disbelieving.

“I was forced to make that choice back then! Why can’t you understand me?”

“‘Forced to,’ huh? What a pathetic excuse.”

I scoffed, turning my head away.

“Were you ‘forced’ to marry Seraphina too?”

“No one forced you to do any of this. These were all *your* choices.”

After I finished speaking, I felt a sense of relief wash over me.

Damien fell silent, his expression wounded.

But I was the one who should be hurting the most.

I’d clung to the foolish hope that when Damien finally returned, I’d get my wedding, the one that was rightfully mine. That we'd just… go back to how things were, to our quiet, peaceful life.

But I was wrong.

Terribly, horribly wrong. I was so wrong that Damien already had a whole new family, and I was still holding onto a ghost.

The more I thought about it, the more ridiculous I felt.

“Chloe, let’s go.”

“I’ve already called my lawyer! We *have* to talk about Chloe’s custody!”

But Damien was insistent, as if he was afraid I’d run away.

I struggled twice, but Damien wrapped his arms around me and Chloe.

A wave of violent nausea churned in my stomach, and I shoved him away with all my might.

Damien’s hands froze in mid-air. Noticing the disgust in my eyes, he stood still, stunned.

“Aria,” he whispered, his voice laced with disbelief, “do you truly hate me that much?”

He mumbled, his body swaying slightly.

Just as he reached out again, Seraphina’s shriek echoed through the cafe.

“Damien! Stella’s gone! Help me find her!”

Damien didn't hesitate for a second. He spun around, abandoning us, and rushed out of the shop.

Outside, Seraphina watched me with a smug, triumphant smirk. And peeking from behind a parked car, a supposedly “missing” Stella was barely suppressing her giggles.

Their mockery made me feel utterly humiliated.

I forced myself to appear calm, picked up Chloe, and walked away.
