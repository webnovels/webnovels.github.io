I looked at the package and opened it.

Inside was a tiny lipstick, pathetically small.

Coincidentally, an ad for the brand appeared on my phone.

This tiny thing was a freebie from a Valentine's Day gift box.

I almost laughed at the irony.

Jasper's face looked a bit awkward, but he forced a response:

"I know you don't usually wear makeup. I searched every brand for this size. Please stop making a fuss."

I ignored his words.

The alarm went off, and I took my medicine one after another.

Jasper's expression changed. He quickly took the medicine bottle away.

"What are you doing? Don't you know you can't take medicine while pregnant?"

Seeing my expression, he softened his tone, tossing the lipstick aside.

"Fine, fine. If you don't like this shade, throw it away. I'll buy you another one, okay?"

"Adeline, you're not alone now. Getting upset can affect the baby's development."

I placed the printed divorce agreement on the table.

"The agreement is ready. Sign it when you have time."

"Also, I don't have time to babysit your little secretary. Since you pamper her so much, why not hire her a nanny?"

Jasper was busy, so I didn't bother him with drafting the agreement.

But after hearing it, he directly frowned and stood up suddenly.

"Divorce? Are you joking? Just because I glanced at Fiona during the press conference?"

"She's just my secretary. You were the one who hired her. If there was something between us, it would have happened long ago. Why wait until now? Can you stop overreacting?"
