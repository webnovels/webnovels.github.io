"Is the partnership offer you mentioned still open? I'd like to join."

"Only under one condition: I must have management control of the company, with a 50% stake."

The other party agreed easily, teasingly.

"Adeline, have you finally come around? The shares are negotiable. As long as we can have you onboard, I'm ready to do whatever it takes!"

"But I'm curious. When you graduated, you said you didn't want to work with me. I've waited ten years. Why the sudden change today?"

"Don't ask unnecessary questions. You talk too much."

I rolled my eyes, grabbed my keys, and drove straight to the hospital.

After the procedure, I took a taxi back home.

Jasper and I arrived almost at the same time.

He immediately noticed the shirt from yesterday still on the sofa, frowning.

"Why haven't you done the laundry?"

Turning to the dining table, his face darkened further.

"No dinner either? Are you feeling unwell today?"

Holding my aching stomach, I didn't want to speak. I just looked at my phone.

I simply shook my head in response.

Jasper casually handed me a package, saying:

"Then do it now. Make enough for one more person; I'm taking it to the company. The press conference just ended, and I have to work late tonight."

"Fiona is with me, and we can't let an employee go hungry."

In the past, I would have managed all the household chores without him asking.

During the day, I was the marketing manager, hustling in the business world with him.

At night, I was the housewife, doing laundry, cooking, and catering to his whims.

This had been my life for ten years.

But now, I found it utterly pointless.

After he spoke, I only let out a cold laugh, not moving.

"Sorry, I can't."

"Besides, didn't you already eat out?"

"I'm not just talking about food."

Jasper's calm expression suddenly turned cold.

"What nonsense are you spouting?"

"I've been busy all day. Do I have to come home and see your sullen face at night? Do I owe you anything?"

"You know today is our wedding anniversary. Didn't I bring you a gift? Can you stop being so passive-aggressive? When will you understand my difficulties?"
