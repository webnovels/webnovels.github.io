The live broadcast of the press conference continued on the screen.

Jasper, smiling, took the microphone from Fiona and continued from her introduction.

"Thanks to my secretary, for the past ten years, every project, big or small, has gone through her hands. She's worked hard, and I've noticed."

"Taking this opportunity, with everyone here today, I announce the transfer of 20% of the shares to Fiona. From now on, we're not just superior and subordinate; we're also partners. I hope she continues to excel."

The audience gasped in surprise.

Then, a wave of applause followed.

The congratulations brought tears to Fiona's eyes, and Jasper handed her a tissue with a smile.

Since he was the first to be unkind, I felt no guilt in being ungrateful.

I took out my phone and made an appointment for an abortion.
