The day after my sister Olivia gave birth to her child, she was ready to quit her job to focus on taking care of her family. I advised her to return to work after her maternity leave, telling her that financial independence gives women strength and confidence.

But during her first week back at work, her husband Jack fell in love with Alice, the single mother living next door, and insisted on getting a divorce. Jack blamed Olivia for not knowing how to take care of their child or how to comfort her husband, calling her a useless trophy wife. Even their baby rejected Olivia, only drinking Alice's breast milk.

Olivia blamed everything on me. In her fury, she broke into my house and threw me into the swimming pool to drown me while I was unconscious from sleeping pills.
