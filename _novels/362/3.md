The sudden white light was blinding.
What came into view was Liam's handsome but slightly gloomy face.
The man's cheeks were flushed, his clothes disheveled, clearly having just experienced that act.
I looked at him with pleading eyes, hoping he would save me.
But Liam didn't seem surprised that I was awake. He looked at me with disdain.
"Tsk tsk, how pitiful. You're about to be buried alive. Scarlett went to handle the funeral arrangements. Good little brother, let me keep you company for a while."
"Five years ago, your mother uncovered my identity. To clear the obstacles for you, she drove my mother to death and made Dad remove me from the Wilson family! Not only that, you also stole my wedding. The one who should have married Olivia was me!"
"For five years of marriage, you've been tortured by Olivia for five years. I didn't expect you to be so patient, refusing to divorce. I had no choice but to let Scarlett seduce you. You were so stupid, actually falling in love with Scarlett. Didn't you fantasize about going abroad to marry Scarlett? You stole my marriage, so I'm going to steal yours too!"
"I've been waiting for your mother to die. I also tampered with your fake death pill. Once you're buried, you'll watch yourself die with your eyes wide open. Your death day will be my and Scarlett's wedding day."
Liam spoke the cruelest words one by one, and my heart grew colder and colder.
The hope that had just been rekindled was extinguished once again.
Liam curled his lips, extremely pleased.
He took out the water and food prepared in the coffin, saying carelessly:
"Since you're going to die anyway, you won't be able to eat these things. But I'll leave the oxygen tank for you, to let you live a few more days. Too bad you won't be able to see my and Scarlett's wedding."
The coffin was closed again, and the last bit of light disappeared.
My fingers dug deep into the wooden board, my nails almost breaking.
My eyelids grew heavier, and I passed out from exhaustion.
When I woke up again, I could only hear the hustle and bustle outside.
My funeral had begun.
Guests exchanged greetings and laughter, no one mourning my "death".
"The Wilson family's second young master has finally been tortured to death. Olivia beat him until he was unrecognizable, but for the sake of the family, he refused to divorce no matter what."
"He deserved it! Who told him to steal his brother's woman? His brother is more handsome and capable than him. If it weren't for being exposed as an illegitimate child, how could it have been Lucas's turn to take over?"
"Exactly. To marry Olivia, he even drugged her. How shameless. As a result, right after they got married, Olivia miscarried their child. Serves him right. Now that he's dead, Olivia won't even attend the funeral."
"Liam is the lucky one. Although he suffered five years ago, now that his brother is dead, he's the only heir to the Wilson family. In a week, he's even going to marry the only daughter of the Shen Group. Who would dare call him an illegitimate child now?"
...
People discussed my family and my marriage, freely belittling and mocking me.
Yet they didn't know that lying in the coffin was a living person, desperately waiting for death.
The priest finished the prayer, and it was time for the burial.
I struggled bitterly, feeling time ticking away second by second, yet no one could save me.
I was carried to the cemetery. Before being lowered into the grave, I heard Scarlett leaning against my coffin.
I desperately forced three words out of my throat: "Save... save me."
