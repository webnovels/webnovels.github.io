But no one could hear my inner cries. The only response was Scarlett's cold voice.
"Liam, you're still too soft-hearted. We've planned this for so long, all for this day. We can't ruin everything at this point."
"Have you forgotten how Lucas took everything from you? If it weren't for his mother, your identity as an illegitimate child wouldn't have been exposed, your mother wouldn't have died, you would have married the woman you loved, and you wouldn't have been kicked out of the Wilson family!"
"Don't worry, when this is all over, I'll make it up to Lucas."
My whole body trembled, my limbs numb and convulsing, as if a thousand needles were piercing my body.
The taste of blood filled my mouth, and I had to swallow the metallic sweetness in my throat.
Scarlett, I don't want your compensation!
If you just let me out, I'll willingly give up my position as heir, run far away, and never bother you again!
Liam seemed to be crying, choking out:
"Scarlett, you're so good to me. Every time I was sad and upset, you deliberately provoked Olivia to torture Lucas, and had her send photos and videos."
"Seeing Lucas beaten black and blue, kneeling on the ground begging for mercy, and him locked in the closet for three days and nights until he was dehydrated, it always made me feel better."
Scarlett held Liam tightly in her arms, sighing:
"As long as you're happy, hurting Lucas a thousand or ten thousand times is worth it. This is what he owes you."
In the coffin, my tears gushed out.
My heart felt as if it had been heavily hammered, caving in.
Scarlett, is this how you've always seen me?
How can people be so cruel?
So every time I was abused, it was your doing.
You were extremely gentle to my face, but behind my back, you took videos and photos of me being tortured to please another man.
I laughed silently, tears sliding down the corners of my eyes, instantly absorbed by the wooden board.
Perhaps it was because of the extreme pain, but my body suddenly burst forth with unprecedented strength.
My fingers could move!
No matter how much I hated this despicable couple, I just wanted to live now!
My nails scratched several marks on the coffin board beneath me, making a faint scraping sound.
I hoped they could hear the movement inside the coffin.
The next second, my hope was shattered.
I heard the sound of passionate kissing outside.
I could feel the man being pressed against the coffin, his back tightly against the wooden board.
I desperately tapped on the wooden board with my fingers.
But the two outside were lost in the heat of the moment and couldn't hear anything.
The man and woman's heavy breathing intertwined, the two of them bumping against the coffin, making it creak incessantly.
My desperate cries for help were easily drowned out.
The woman moved her body while professing her love:
"Liam, do you know how long I've waited for this day? I've finally waited for you to give up Olivia and agree to marry me."
"For you, I endured the disgust of seducing Lucas. That night with him, all I could think of was your face."
I closed my eyes, gritted my teeth, and forced myself not to listen to those nauseating sounds outside.
I thought my desire to live would outweigh my hatred for them.
I was wrong. I hate them so much.
As much as I once loved Scarlett, I now hate her just as intensely.
I hate myself even more for falling in love with two women who hurt me without restraint.
After what seemed like an eternity, it finally quieted down outside.
Just as I was despairing and waiting for death, the coffin suddenly opened a crack.
