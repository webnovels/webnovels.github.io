I had just gotten up, but Lucas was already fully equipped and standing at the front door.

"The clothes are all here, and the documents are organized."

He frowned slightly, his slender fingers brushing away stray hair as he carefully checked the luggage.

"The calming incense got a bit damp, so I didn't bring it. I'll buy you new ones later."

"I packed the stuffed animal separately......"

"Throw it away."

I said flatly.

That stuffed animal was a gift from Lucas.

He had originally intended to give it to Sophia, but when she refused, he passed it on to me.

Pathetically, I had treasured it.

Lucas was stunned.

"Why?"

This was the first time he hadn't obeyed my order.

"Don't you really like it? Keep it......"

"Lucas!"

A girl ran into the yard with light steps, throwing herself into Lucas's arms.

"Thank you so much for yesterday. I came to express my gratitude."

Lucas stiffened, not knowing where to put his hands, his ears turning red and hot where the girl couldn't see.

His scorpion tail raised high, afraid of hurting her.

I glanced at the back of my hand.

It was red and swollen from being grazed by the poison needle last night, almost breaking the skin.

Maybe I was used to it, as I couldn't feel the pain anymore.

"Oh? Isn't this the doll I didn't want?"

Sophia picked up the beautifully packaged stuffed animal, examining it.

"Why is it here?"

"Did you give it to Olivia?"

Lucas glanced at me.

Slightly hesitant.

"Uh...... no."

I turned my face away, unconsciously clenching my hand at my side.

He said: "I forgot to throw it away at home. It's just trash."

His scorpion tail hooked.

The stuffed animal was flung into the garbage pile.

Its plush face still wore a smile as it tumbled down, soaked in filth and slime.

"I knew it. How could you give Olivia the trash I didn't want?"

Lucas caught sight of my pale face, his pupils trembling before quickly looking away.

I didn't know if it was guilt or pity.

He was afraid Sophia would misunderstand.

So he chose to hurt me. Well, there was no comparison between me and her.

Even gifts were just leftovers others didn't want.

I unclenched my hand.

Several crescent-shaped marks were left on my palm.

"Throw away the luggage. I'll buy new ones."

"I don't want any of it anymore."

I looked at Lucas.

"Including you, I don't want you anymore either."
