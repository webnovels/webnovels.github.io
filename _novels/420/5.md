On a rare day off, I went to the bar alone.

It was mostly beast-people inside. Seeing me, a pure human, they couldn't help but be curious, gathering around.

"Hey sis."

A young man sat down beside me, his yellow ears perked up.

"Let's play together."

"I'll teach you a game we beast-people play......"

His tail unconsciously wrapped around my arm, soft and furry, feeling nice.

"Are you a cat?"

He paused, then smiled, revealing sharp teeth.

"Yeah, do you like it? Many people......"

Before he could finish, he was lifted up by the neck.

The young man was about to get angry.

Seeing the poison needle suspended in front of his eyes, he immediately deflated.

Lucas stood tall, his mere presence driving away many beast-people.

In the dim light, his expression was unclear, but the veins on his neck were clearly visible.

"He's not a cat, he's a leopard."

"It's so dangerous outside. How could you go out alone? Or is he your new bodyguard?"

I stared straight at Lucas.

"Put him down, then get out."

An invisible pressure spread through the bar.

Lucas took a deep breath and threw the young man to the ground.

Instead of leaving, he came closer to me.

"Let's go home."

"The magnetic field has been unstable lately. Be careful of riots."

"What riots?" someone spoke up. "General Ethan is about to return. Who would dare rebel!"

I instinctively looked towards the bar entrance.

No one. A wave of disappointment washed over me.

Lucas saw it clearly.

His heart inexplicably irritated.

"Let's go."

He reached out to pull me.

The young man suddenly pounced, biting Lucas's arm hard, tearing at it.

Immediately after, red-eyed beast-people surged from all corners of the bar, attacking anything alive, especially pure humans.

Countless eyes stared at me hungrily.

If Lucas dared to leave, I would be torn to shreds.

"Lucas!"

Sophia crouched in the corner, tears falling in big drops.

"I'm scared!"

Out of survival instinct, I clutched Lucas's clothes tightly, my fingernails curling up and bleeding.

"Protect me, you're my bodyguard!"

He tried to break free.

"Don't you dare! If you leave me, I'll have the Commander kill you and Sophia!"

Lucas hesitated.

At that moment, Sophia was pounced on by a tiger beast.

"Sophia!"

I don't remember much of what happened after that, but anyway, Lucas abandoned me again.

It hurt so much.

I bled so much.

Herbivorous beast-people fought over the grass and flowers growing on the floor, while carnivorous ones greedily sucked at my wounds.

A flash of white light passed before my eyes.

Time seemed to freeze, and the next second, all the beast-people collapsed on the ground.

I was lifted up.

"Olivia, hold onto me."

The light shone on his face.

Was it Lucas?

No, he was never this gentle, never called me Olivia, and would never hold me in his arms.

"Ethan......"

"Mm."
