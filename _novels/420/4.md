I could sense my life force draining away.

For some reason I felt tired, slept longer, and even the plants in the lab were no longer fully under my control.

"I'm tired. I'm going back first."

"Alright, Doctor."

Lucas was waiting outside the lab.

He stuffed a hot water bottle he had been holding for a long time into my arms, saying nothing, walking on the windward side to block the flying snow.

"Cough cough—"

I coughed violently.

The experiment earlier had used up a lot of energy. I could barely stand steady and started running a fever as soon as I got home.

Lucas used cold water to wipe my body over and over.

"Ethan......"

I was delirious with fever, my hand gently caressing Lucas's cheek.

"I love you so much......"

He suddenly grabbed my hand.

"The Ethan you're calling, is it me?"

"Who is your Ethan?"

I closed my eyes, about to fall asleep in a daze.

Lucas kept asking.

"Stop asking. Ethan is you, okay......"

He breathed a sigh of relief, the tension in his back finally relaxing.

He took out a photo hidden in his pocket.

Examining it carefully, the man's face was identical to his, but Lucas couldn't remember ever taking such a photo.

"Maybe I forgot."

He muttered to himself.

As he pulled up the blanket, the woman's semi-transparent hand caught his attention.

Lucas's heart skipped a beat.

When he blinked, her hand had returned to normal.

"Ding—"

The ringtone interrupted his thoughts.

"Lucas, you haven't comed his thoughts.

"Lucas to see me in so long......"

Sophia was drunk on the other end.

"If you don't come, I might be taken away......"

Lucas put on his coat and was about to leave.

I grabbed him.

"Don't go. Stay and take care of me. I feel so bad......"

"I'm about to die......"

He broke free.

"Don't talk nonsense."

"Sophia has an emergency. I have to go over there first."

His retreating figure was resolute, never lingering for even half a second for me. He was supposed to be my bodyguard, yet he always left me behind.

He had promised to protect me with his life.

Lucas, I trusted you time and time again.

Everything Sophia said was true.

"If the Federation hadn't forced him, he would never be your bodyguard."

"The person Lucas cares about most is me. Olivia, even if you died in front of him one day, he wouldn't feel an ounce of pity."

"You're just a burden to him."

Whether it was during the beast riots three years ago when he left me in the eye of the storm, or three years later when I told him I was dying.

Lucas never took it to heart.

I called my assistant.

"Take out the blood I stored for Lucas before."

"Yes, give it to the North District for them to cultivate crops."

I wouldn't leave anything for him anymore.
