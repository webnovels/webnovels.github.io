I applied to the Federation for a new bodyguard.

"Are you sure?"

"You spent half your life saving Lucas."

The Commander smiled.

"Miss Olivia, the crops in the East District are growing well. Would you like to take a look?"

"It took half your blood."

"And the place where you knelt and kowtowed in the Council Chamber has grown green grass. That beast-man doesn't know, does he?"

"How could such a failed genetic experiment be worth you risking your life?"

"Oh, I forgot, he looks just like Miss Olivia's childhood sweetheart. No wonder......"

I had already made up my mind.

Replace Lucas, never have anything to do with him again.

The next day.

The new bodyguard sent by the Federation arrived. It was a tiger beast, even taller than Lucas, with a snow-white long tail curled around the luggage.

"Hello, Miss Olivia."

I cleared out the room I had prepared for Lucas and let the tiger beast move in.

Just as I was explaining his duties, the doorbell rang.

I didn't go to open it.

Lucas waited outside for a while, thinking no one was home, so he entered the passcode himself.

"Incorrect passcode—"

He thought he had misheard.

He tried again.

"Incorrect passcode."

He started knocking on the door.

Annoyed by the noise, I asked the tiger beast to send him away.

A huge crash shook the whole house.

I rushed out to see Lucas wrestling with him, neither giving way, tearing down the front door.

"Stop!"

Lucas looked up, jealousy almost materializing and dripping down.

His scorpion tail stabbed forcefully into the tiger beast's waist.

With a muffled groan, the tiger beast collapsed, his skin visibly turning purple.

"Are you crazy!"

I slapped Lucas hard.

His head turned to the side, splattering several drops of blood. Only then did I notice the bloody hole on the back of his head where the tiger beast had clawed him.

"Who is he?"

Lucas stared intently at the man.

"My new bodyguard."

I supported the tiger beast, quickly cutting open my arm to feed him my blood.

Lucas's eyes turned red.

"I am your bodyguard."

The fire in him died down, and he stood there at a loss, especially when he got no response from me. Even his scorpion tail drooped.

"I am your bodyguard......"

"You can't protect me," I said coldly. "Get out."

He stood rooted to the spot.

Perhaps realizing he had gone too far before, he mumbled, unable to utter a word of rebuttal.

"I can......"

"I'll definitely protect you well from now on, with my life......"

Lucas's face was reflected in the glass window, his jaw clenched, gaze locked on me.

He didn't even blink as blood flowed into his eyes.

"Give me one more chance."

The tiger beast woke up.

He pushed me away and rushed towards the door, afraid of getting stung again.

"Olivia, no one is more suitable for this job than me," Lucas stepped forward. "I can protect you."

I was silent for a while.

Looking at him.

"You said you'd protect me with your life."

Lucas nodded vigorously.

"I promise."
