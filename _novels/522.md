Olivia Sullivan, the Oscar-winning actress and my girlfriend of five years, was caught spending a night with a mysterious man.

To protect Marcus Shaw's reputation, she quickly posted intimate photos of them on Twitter, publicly acknowledging their relationship.

The caption read: "Waiting for falling leaves, cold winds, autumn fireworks, and a better us. From beginning to end, I've only loved one person."

Looking at the man in the photo whose face was 50% similar to mine, a chill gradually enveloped my entire body.

So for all these years, I had always been someone else's stand-in.

Olivia called soon to explain: "Marcus just returned to the country and can't afford any damage to his reputation. I did this for work reasons, don't take it seriously."

I only replied calmly: "It's fine, I understand."

Seeing that I had no reaction, Olivia sounded confused on the other end: "Why aren't you jealous today?"
