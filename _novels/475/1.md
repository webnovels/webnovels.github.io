"Officer, I'm at XX University, 3rd floor of the teaching building. Someone is trying to rob me, deliberately damaging my property, and assaulting me."

Olivia's face changed dramatically. She lunged at me. "Are you crazy?!"

She snatched my phone and, without even looking, threw it out the window.

Crack!

The phone shattered on the concrete below.

The classroom fell silent for a second.

But to their surprise, in less than ten minutes, police sirens were heard outside.

When the police entered the classroom, Tyler and Olivia's faces instantly turned pale.

"Who called the police?" the lead officer asked, looking around.

"I did," I raised my hand. "They tried to rob me and smashed my phone."

The officer looked at the scattered items on the floor, then at my broken game console and the smashed phone outside the window. He frowned. "What happened here?"

Tyler immediately put on an innocent act. "Officer, it's a misunderstanding! We were just joking around!"

Olivia quickly chimed in. "Yes, yes, it was just a prank between classmates!"

Other classmates also started testifying.

I coldly scanned the room. These people were exactly the same as when they gave false testimony in my previous life.

The officer let out a cold laugh. "Smashing phones and hitting people, you call that a joke?"

Mr. Johnson, our counselor, rushed in, his face ashen. "What's going on here?! Causing such a scene at school?!"

The officer briefly explained the situation. After listening, Mr. Johnson glared at Tyler. "You again!"

Tyler tried to argue, but the evidence was irrefutable.

In the end, under the police's mediation, Tyler and Olivia had to compensate me for my phone and game console, and apologize publicly.

As we left the office, Olivia lowered her voice, gritting her teeth, "Jack Wilson, you just wait!"

Looking at her twisted expression, I suddenly smiled.

"Sure, I'll be waiting."

While packing my things in the dorm, I felt like someone had gone through my stuff, but nothing was missing, so I didn't think much of it.

Just as I walked out of the school, a black Maybach stopped in front of me.

"Young Master Wilson, the old master has important matters to discuss. He needs you to come home immediately."

Mr. Wang, the butler, didn't let me speak, just pulled me into the car.

That evening, my father pushed two documents in front of me, his gaze sharp behind his gold-rimmed glasses.

"Jack, this is your last chance to choose. The $30 billion family trust fund inheritance rights, or a monthly allowance of $1,500."

"The $30 billion has already been deposited into your Swiss bank card. As soon as you sign, you can access that money and take over the family business."

The crystal chandelier behind my father refracted blinding light. I squinted, momentarily seeing that car rushing towards me again, hearing the crunch of bones being crushed.

Tyler's vicious grin from my previous life's death still echoed in my ears.

"I choose the $1,500 monthly allowance," I said.
