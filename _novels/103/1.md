Melody was shocked that I, who had always been timid and afraid, dared to fight back.

She immediately ordered the butler, Mr. Quinn, to drag me away.

Mr. Quinn had barely taken a step when I glared at him. He quickly stepped back, a flicker of panic in his eyes. "Miss Chloe, didn't Madam and Master William confine you at home? How...how did you get here?"

I fixed Mr. Quinn with an icy stare, frightening him so much he lowered his head, not daring to meet my eyes. "My father is one of the world's wealthiest men, and I'm his only daughter. Yet you dare call me 'Miss Chloe'?"

"Mr. Quinn, you've worked for our family for 20 years. If you can't even recognize your true masters, what use are you to me?"

In my previous life, Mr. Quinn ignored my father's orders to take good care of me. Instead, he followed my stepmother and stepbrother's commands, often depriving me of food and clothes and verbally abusing me.

When Melody beat me to death with a golf club, he even stood by watching coldly.

Now hearing that I wanted to fire him, Mr. Quinn fell to his knees begging for mercy. "Please spare me, Miss..."

Melody put on an act of helping Mr. Quinn up, then took on a sisterly tone to scold me.

"Chloe, you're just a singer I picked up from a nightclub. What right do you have to fire Mr. Quinn?"

Tiffany, the daughter of the company's general manager who always fawned over Melody, couldn't wait to jump in and yell at me.

"If it wasn't for our Melody taking you in from that nightclub, who knows where you'd be now. How dare you be so rude to Melody!"

The other guests all felt indignant and started criticizing me as well.

"So this is the singer that Miss Collins took in? How ungrateful!"

"Exactly! I heard Miss Collins took her in and treated her like a real sister, indulging her in everything. Who knew she'd be so presumptuous!"

"A mere singer dares to impersonate the real Chloe Collins? She must have a death wish!"

How ridiculous. The truth was that I was the one who had taken Melody in from the nightclub.

But to my surprise, when my stepmother Vanessa saw Melody, she strangely loved her like her own child. My stepbrother William was thoroughly captivated by Melody's charms and sweet talk, doting on her excessively.

So for any company events or galas, they would have Melody attend while keeping me confined at home.

Living this life again, I've finally woken up.

My father is an incredibly wealthy and powerful man who adores me.

Why should I let these people walk all over me?

I swept my gaze across the crowd, finally locking eyes with Tiffany. I gave her a contemptuous smile.

"Who do you think you are? Even if your father Thomas were here, he wouldn't dare raise his voice to me."

Tiffany was stunned that I dared to call out her father's name in public. Enraged, she raised her hand to slap me.

I was quicker, slapping her across the face first.

Her face turned deathly pale with anger as she shrieked, "You...you dare hit me? I won't let you get away with this!"

Melody gnashed her teeth and shouted, "Someone come and seize this singer Chloe!"

Security guards rushed over. I swept my cold gaze across them and declared loudly, "My father said that if anyone dares touch a hair on my head, he'll make them disappear from this world!"

With those words, the guards froze in place, not daring to take another step forward.

Melody took two steps back, her guilty conscience showing. She tried to maintain her composure as she yelled, "You...you're lying! Everyone here knows that for any company events or galas, Mom and William always have me attend."

"If you're really the true Chloe Collins, why have they never once let you appear?"

The crowd nodded in agreement.

"Miss Collins has a point. That singer must be lying and trying to impersonate the real Chloe Collins!"

"How outrageous. A perfectly good gala ruined by this singer who snuck in."

I gave a disdainful laugh and turned to Mr. Quinn standing nearby. I ordered him, "If you don't want to be thrown out of the Collins family, go fetch my stepmother and stepbrother."

"Tell them that if they don't come immediately, I'm going to beat Melody to death."

Mr. Quinn was shocked.

He knew that Vanessa and William both doted excessively on Melody.

Every time, no matter who was right or wrong, as long as Melody was unhappy, they would severely punish me.

But after a brief hesitation, he still hurried out.

Melody smiled smugly at me. "Chloe, I think you've lost your mind. How dare you summon Mom and William here."

In my previous life, when Melody was beating me bloody with a golf club, I had begged them for help, only to be cruelly rejected.

Now that I've returned from hell, I won't let any of them off the hook.

Before she finished speaking, a warning voice suddenly came from outside.

"Chloe, you haven't been disciplined for three days and now you think you can do whatever you want?"
