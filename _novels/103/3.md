The smug look on Melody's face instantly turned to terror as she looked up.

Vanessa strode into the banquet hall.

The guests all bowed slightly in greeting. "Mrs. Collins."

The bodyguards immediately released their grip on me.

Seeing it was Vanessa, the fear in Melody's eyes dissipated. She flashed me a gloating smile.

Vanessa's eyes swept over Melody with concern, making sure she was unharmed. Only then did she turn to glare at me with utter disgust.

"Who gave you permission to steal Melody's identity as the real Chloe Collins?"

In my previous life, I never understood why Vanessa was so biased towards Melody.

It wasn't until after I died that I learned the truth - Melody was actually the daughter of Vanessa's true love.

That man had once sworn undying love to Vanessa. But later, Vanessa was forced to marry my widowed father in order to save her family's failing business.

A year after marrying my father, that man died in a car accident while trying to save Vanessa.

So when Vanessa discovered Melody's true identity, she loved her like her own flesh and blood, vowing to give Melody the best of everything.

Although Vanessa held the position of CEO in my father's company, the person with true absolute power was still my father.

Understanding the full story now, I couldn't help but laugh coldly. "I'm only taking back what rightfully belongs to me. How is that stealing?"

Now that even Vanessa was backing Melody's claims, the crowd below became even bolder in hurling abuse at me.

"This singer not only impersonates the real Chloe Collins, she even dares to speak so rudely to Mrs. Collins. She really doesn't know her place!"

"I think she's gone mad with greed, fantasizing about being rich. What a fool!"

William angrily declared, "Chloe, you've been eating and living well in our home all thanks to Melody's kindness."

"But we never imagined our generosity would lead you to have such foolish delusions of impersonating Melody."

A cunning look flashed through Melody's eyes.

She pointed to the jadeite necklace around her neck and asked, "Mom, isn't my necklace beautiful?"

Vanessa was momentarily stunned. She glanced at me, realizing Melody had snatched it from me.

She smiled and nodded. "It's beautiful. It suits you perfectly."

Getting the answer she wanted, Melody grew even bolder. "Everyone, you all heard that, right? My mom has confirmed this necklace belongs to me."

"Chloe was just lying earlier when she said my dad gave it to her. She actually stole it from me."

The crowd below all chimed in agreement.

I glanced at the clock on the wall. It was already 9:59 pm. I couldn't help but smirk.

In less than a minute, my father would arrive.

Seeing I showed no signs of remorse, William flew into a rage.

"Mom, Chloe has publicly impersonated our family's true daughter. It's unforgivable. I suggest we kick her out of the Collins family!"

Vanessa hesitated, not agreeing immediately. "Chloe, if you kneel down and apologize to Melody now, and promise never to steal her identity as the real Chloe Collins again, I can allow you to continue staying in our family."

Melody's eyes flashed with displeasure. Of course she didn't want me to stay. She quickly spoke up.

"Mom, it's fine. She can't really steal my identity as the real Chloe anyway."

"But she did try to impersonate me in public. If we don't punish her severely, won't others think our wealthy Collins family is easy to bully?"

Seeing how this could damage the family's reputation, Vanessa's expression instantly changed. She berated me harshly.

"Chloe, I'll give you one last chance. Kneel down and apologize to Melody right now. Otherwise, I'll kick you out of the Collins family immediately!"

I laughed disdainfully. With my father away, she really thought she could act like the queen of the family.

"You and William have twisted the truth, allowing Melody to impersonate me as the real Chloe Collins. You're the ones at fault. Why should I apologize?"

"Besides, you're just my stepmother. What right do you have to kick me out of the Collins family?"

William snorted coldly. "When Dad's not here, Mom is in charge of all family affairs. Of course she has the right to kick you out."

Seeing me dare to talk back, Vanessa flew into a rage. She shouted for all to hear.

"Someone come and take Chloe away."

"From today on, Chloe is forbidden from ever setting foot in the Collins family again!"

Melody shook her head at me in mock pity, sneering, "Chloe, bullying me is one thing, but you dare to disrespect Mom like that?"

"Someone bring me a bottle of acid. I'm going to destroy her face. Let's see how she tries to impersonate me after that!"

Vanessa and William nodded in approval. Melody was practically giddy with excitement.

Dong, dong.

The grandfather clock struck 10 pm.

Mr. Quinn came running up to me, out of breath. "Miss, the Master has returned."

A large group of bodyguards in black suits rushed in, lining up on both sides like an honor guard. The atmosphere turned solemn.

Then, my father strode in with a group of company executives, his voice booming like thunder.

"Such big talk! Let's see who dares touch a hair on my precious daughter's head!"
