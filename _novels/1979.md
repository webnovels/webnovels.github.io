Finally, after bearing three of his children, I was permitted inside Julian Campbell's mansion.

But in this house, I was not Julian's wife, nor the children's mother.

I was just a nanny, brought in to help.

Julian placed the newborn in my arms. His voice was cold and distant.

"You have three days. Leave when the regular nanny Martha returns."

"Do not tell Charlotte who you are. Do not make trouble for me."

"After these three days end, I'll send you back to your villa outside the city."

"I will give you everything you want, except the title of Mrs. Campbell."

He was so sure, so certain I would compromise again, as before, for the children.

But he did not know I had already bought my plane ticket to leave the country before coming here.

I was only here to say goodbye.


The baby in my arms, as if sensing my turmoil, began to whimper.

Julian frowned, his eyes darting toward the master bedroom upstairs.

"Keep the child quiet. Don't disturb Charlotte."

As if on cue, Charlotte descended the stairs in a white dress, a child held firmly in each hand.

Her delicate, pale face seemed to glow with an almost ethereal light.

And in that instant, Julian's entire demeanor softened.

He slipped back into the role of the perfect husband, the doting father.

He returned to the home that belonged only to him and Charlotte.

He quickly went to her, pulling her frail body into his embrace. His voice was doting, yet laced with a hint of reproach.

"It's so cold out. Why are you barefoot?"

"You're so delicate; be careful not to catch a cold."

As he spoke, he naturally bent down, carefully slipping a pair of cashmere socks onto Charlotte's feet.

He was so reverent, so earnest, as if he were tending to an invaluable treasure.

Charlotte was clearly accustomed to Julian's doting care.

She leaned into his embrace, her voice soft and sweet.

"I just wanted to see you sooner."

"You've been gone for so many days. If I didn't have Leo and Lily with me, I'd be so lonely..."

Hearing this, Leo immediately puffed out his chest, his face beaming with pride.

"I said I'd be Mom's big hero!"

"I'll always stay by Mom's side and never let her be sad!"

Lily nodded along.

"Me too!"

"Dad, I even picked fresh flowers for Mom today. I'm even better than Leo!"

The two children, one after another, crowded around Charlotte, showering her with affection and concern.

What a heartwarming scene, what a wonderfully happy family of four.

But it was me... I was their mother!

My heart twisted painfully.

Tears blurred my vision as I looked at Julian.

But he ignored my tearful gaze, simply taking the baby from my arms and presenting her to Charlotte.

Charlotte took the infant with practiced ease, smiling.

"What a darling baby. Have you decided on a name?"

"How about we call her Ava?"

Faced with Charlotte's suggestion, Julian gave his consent without a moment's hesitation.

He immediately nodded, instructing his assistant to change the baby's name.

I instinctively reached out to stop him, my voice urgent.

"Julian, you promised me..."

When I gave birth to this child, I suffered a severe hemorrhage and was forced to have a hysterectomy, losing my ability to bear children forever.

I pleaded with Julian, begging him to let me keep this last child by my side.

But he looked at me with cold indifference and said, "Amelia, don't be childish."

"The Campbell bloodline cannot be left outside the family."

"However, considering all you've been through, I can allow you to name this child as a keepsake."

That fleeting moment of tenderness, hard-won after almost dying, was now being casually erased by a single sentence from Charlotte.

I looked at Julian, unwilling to accept it.

My eyes welled up, tears threatening to spill.

Julian noticed my distress.

But he merely frowned slightly, quickly averting his gaze.

"Charlotte, this is Martha's niece. Martha is sick, so she's filling in for three days."

"If you don't like her, I can have her sent away right now."

"She'll never appear before you or the children again, ever."

That statement was an open threat, bare and brutal.

I bit my lower lip, desperately trying not to cry aloud.

But the wrenching pain in my heart only intensified.

Years of accumulated grievances surged over me all at once.
