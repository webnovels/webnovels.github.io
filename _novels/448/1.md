Our daughter Lily also looked at me smugly.

"You left the Young family so decisively back then. I thought you had some special skills up your sleeve. Turns out you've just been wandering around homeless all this time!"

"If I were you, I'd find a block of tofu and smash my head against it. Save everyone the oxygen you're wasting."

I paused for a moment, looking at Lily with a complex gaze.

I couldn't believe that after all these years, she still hadn't changed her disrespectful ways.

But I wasn't angry. Instead, I looked at them calmly.

"What does this have to do with you?" I asked coolly.

From the moment they kicked me out of the Young family, I had no connection to them anymore.

"Your family may be better off now, even comparable to one of Lucas's subsidiaries," I said.

"But that's your own business. No need to brag about it to me."

Seeing that I didn't react the way they wanted, father and daughter were both stunned for a moment.

After a while, Jack looked at me with disdain.

"You've been reduced to wandering the streets, yet you're still so stubborn?" he scoffed.

"If it wasn't for Dad wanting to see you for his 80th birthday, we wouldn't even bother looking at you."

"But since Dad asked, whether you agree or not, you have to come back with us."

Jack's tone was full of determination, just like years ago.

I still shook my head.

"Those are your parents!" he insisted.

"From the moment I left, I no longer had parents," I replied firmly.

They may have raised me, but when I left empty-handed years ago, leaving all the assets to them, I had already repaid that debt.

Seeing me still so stubborn, Lily's face became even more contemptuous.

"You've been reduced to wandering the streets. No need to put on an act in front of us," she sneered.

"Us bringing you back is a blessing for you, understand?"

"But just because you're coming back doesn't mean you can have any ideas about Aunt Emily. We'll never let that happen."

Looking at her increasingly twisted expression, my heart sank.

She had always been cunning, even as a child.

At just seven or eight years old, to stay with her aunt forever, she deliberately ran into the middle of the road to lure me over.

When a speeding car approached, she suddenly dodged aside. I was so focused on saving her that I was thrown seven or eight meters by the impact.

While I was seriously injured in the hospital, she even slandered me, saying I was trying to take her to commit suicide together, just so Emily could smoothly enter the Young family.

Later, when I told Jack about this incident, he just scoffed dismissively.

"She was only eight years old. How could she have such vicious thoughts?" he had said.

"I think you're the truly vicious one, framing your own daughter for your own benefit."

What he said wasn't wrong. If I hadn't experienced it myself, I wouldn't have believed an eight-year-old could have such malicious intentions either.

But that was the reality, no matter how unbelievable.

The flesh and blood I once cherished more than my own life turned out to be the one who hurt me the deepest.

Looking at Lily before me now, I had completely written her off as a stranger in my heart.

Just as I was lost in thought, Jack and Lily kicked aside the dog that had accompanied me for years, roughly dragging me into their car.

I struggled desperately, wanting to check on my dog's condition, but I was no match for the two of them.

Lily even took out a fruit knife from the car and waved it in front of my face.

"You'd better behave, you ugly freak. Otherwise, I'll disfigure the other side of your face too!" she threatened.
