That night.

Tigers and foxes attacked the territory together.

I led the warrior wolves in defense, but Gideon broke through from the side, driving the foxes and tigers away.

Gideon was injured protecting the wolf pups.

His wound oozed black blood, a clear sign of poison.

The human woman named Nora is a doctor.

She came at the sound and without hesitation sucked the poison out for Gideon.

But the poison had already reached his lungs.

Nora said, "We must climb the mountain to get the snow lotus to cure Gideon."

She called him Gideon.

But even I, as luna, can only call him alpha.

In this urgent moment.

I shouldn't focus on this.

The pack looked to me.

Hoping I'd make a decision.

The alpha fell, so the luna must rise.

At this moment, Gideon held my hand.

He firmly said, "Listen to Nora, she won't harm me."

That sentence contained many meanings.

But in a life-and-death situation.

No one focused on anything else.

I said, "Finn and Milo, accompany me up the mountain, the rest of the pack guard the territory, ensure the pack's stability."

"Yes!"

After a unified howl.

I took the two bravest warrior wolves and headed for the snowy peak.

Before leaving, Nora specifically instructed, "Gideon’s poison will spread throughout his body in three days, so please, luna, bring back the snow lotus within that time."

After speaking.

She knelt on the ground and bowed to me.

I didn't understand what her bow meant.

Gideon and I are married.

We are one.

Finding the snow lotus for Gideon is something I ought to do.

Her bow seemed to entrust Gideon's life to me...

But what was her relation to Gideon?

What position did she have to bow like that?

I left.

Thinking, when I return from the mountain, I will surely drive this woman out of the pack.

The mountain is far.

The journey is tough.

Finn and Milo guarded me from behind, shielding me from the wind and snow.

When we encountered a cliff, we dared to rest only briefly.

Afraid we couldn't return in three days, delaying Gideon's treatment.

"How could the alpha be injured by a fox, we both know his strength, he was clearly injured on purpose that day..."

Milo bit a branch, showing dissatisfaction.

"And that Nora, who is she to live in the best cave and enjoy the best resources! Even luna was never personally fed by the alpha!

"Luna is the daughter of the previous alpha, if not for luna, who would have served Gideon as king, Gideon can't even compare to a single finger of Finn's in governance or defense!"

Finn frowned, stopping them: "Don't say that again."

Milo was defiant: "I wasn't wrong, it was Finn who rescued Esme from the tiger pack, Gideon just helped Esme home, making her mistakenly think Gideon was her savior, which accidentally led to Gideon becoming alpha."

Esme is my name.

Before becoming luna.

Finn, Milo, and I called each other by our names.

But after my father died, I became luna...

I had more responsibilities.

And grew distant from them.

"Enough, luna is back."

Finn said, and Milo immediately fell silent.

I threw the hunted food on the ground, handing it to the brothers to store.

After thinking, I finally said, "When Gideon and I married, he told me that it was Finn who saved me, so... I've always known Finn is my savior."

I straightened up, looking at Finn: "I will repay your kindness, but it has nothing to do with whether Gideon becomes alpha."

Finn was startled.

His sharp eyes cooled slightly.

Then dimmed a bit.

He lowered his head, placing his hand on his chest, promising, "I swear loyalty to luna."

I frowned slightly.

I didn't dwell on why his loyalty was to luna and not alpha.

Milo, still dissatisfied, muttered softly: "We'll talk when you're married, Gideon really knows how to time things."

In a day and a half, the three of us reached the snowy peak.

It took another half day to find the snow lotus.

After picking the snow lotus, I carefully placed it in an ice box, wrapped it in a hide, and carried it on my shoulder.

Racing against time, the three of us rushed down the mountain.

But I accidentally got caught in a human trap, and my leg was injured.

Blood splattered on the snow lotus.

I quickly wiped it off, relieved to see the snow lotus was unharmed.

But I couldn't walk.

The journey back was so long.

Finn immediately made a sled, and with Milo, they pulled me down the slope.

Finally.

Within the three-day limit.

We delivered the snow lotus to Gideon.

But I didn't expect.

The Gideon who was gravely ill three days ago.

Now had regained his vigor, sitting on the alpha throne.

And the snow lotus, obtained with great effort, was given as a gift to that human woman.

"Nora saved my life, so the snow lotus is her reward."

Gideon said.

Casually.

And I looked at my leg wound, feeling uneasy inside.

Hesitating whether to expel the human woman from the pack.

Gideon added, "Nora is human, it's not suitable for her to stay in the wolf pack for too long, soon I will personally escort her back."

Sending Nora away is what I wanted.

But Gideon personally escorting her, isn't that too... casual...

A human woman.

Is she really worth that to the alpha?

I don't understand, I'm confused.

But that night.

Gideon gave me the answer.
