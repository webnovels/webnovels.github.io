After I Chose to Marry the Country Boy, My Three Rich Fiancés Were Devastated

I'm the true daughter of the Sinclair family, brought back from a small town.

To make up for lost time, my father specially gave me three fiancé candidates to choose from. Back then, only Ethan Grant didn't look down on me for coming from a small town, and I gradually grew dependent on him. Even when he later started deliberately distancing himself from me like the others, I still tried hard to win his favor, thinking he would be moved by my sincerity.

But on the night before our engagement party, I overheard him comforting Ivy Chen, the fake daughter:

"Just bear with it a little longer. She's from a small town after all. Once we're married, I'll be the one managing the Sinclair family business. Then I'll make her kneel down and apologize to you. You're the true lady of the Sinclair family!"

So at the banquet, I turned to my father and said I didn't want to choose any of these three men.

I wanted to choose Liam Kennedy, who grew up with me in that small town.

Last week, he was just brought back to the Kennedy family and was about to be announced as their sole grandson - the next leader of the prestigious Kennedy family in New York!
