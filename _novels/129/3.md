The engagement party was set for next month.

Lucas's mother said the Lu family would handle everything, and I just needed to wait patiently. She gave me the chance to change my mind at any time.

I smiled helplessly and replied: "That wouldn't be fair to Zachary."

He's just sick.

I sent a message to the research institute's assistant, asking them to prepare experimental equipment for me. In my previous life, after Zachary had his heart transplant, I locked myself in the lab for a while to research antibacterial drugs.

Later, when the drug was ready for production, he had already died from infection.

I hope we'll be in time this time.

Suddenly, Lucas sent me a message: "Come to the Nine Nights Club. I have something to discuss with you."

I refused directly.

After Lucas was reborn, the first thing he did was come to my house to cancel our engagement and confess his love for my adopted sister, Rose.

To make Rose happy, he set off fireworks all night.

The topic about them had been trending at number one for a while. Everyone was saying they were a perfect match. Some paparazzi had recorded a video of them walking on the beach.

Rose seemed to get tired and asked Lucas to carry her on his back. I thought he would refuse.

But he didn't. He smiled indulgently, knelt on one knee, gently rubbed her ankle first, and then carried her on his back. His movements were smooth and tender.

Some netizens commented: "Young Master Lu really loves Rose to death."

During this time, he had been by Rose's side, dutifully pleasing her, spoiling her like a little princess. He was trying hard to make up for the regrets of his past life, wanting to live a different life.

I didn't object, as long as it didn't involve me.

But in the end, I still went to the Nine Nights Club, though not because of Lucas.

I wanted to see Zachary. His assistant called me back:

"Miss Young, Mr. Lu is at Nine Nights for a business meeting. If you have urgent matters, you can come directly."

I frowned instinctively and couldn't help but joke: "He's still drinking when he's sick? Is he afraid he's not dying fast enough?"

The assistant on the other end immediately muted himself.

After a moment of silence, only a very light cough came through.

Finally, the assistant hurriedly left a private room number and hung up.
