I pulled out my phone and called him, my voice trembling.
He answered quickly.
"Nolan, where are you?"
His voice was as gentle as ever.
"Lydia, I’m at the office in a meeting, very busy. I’ll call you back later."
The call ended, and Nolan spent a long time soothing the upset woman he was with.
I hid nearby, watching them.
I was flooded with memories of the day Nolan found out I couldn’t have children.
He cried until his eyes were red and knelt before me.
"Lydia, I’m sorry. It’s all my fault."
Yes, he should be sorry.
Back then, I was pregnant, but he was so busy with work that he forgot to check in with me.
A snowstorm blanketed the city, and worried about him, I went out to find him.
I was hit by a car that ran a red light.
I lost the baby.
The doctor said I could never be pregnant again.
Nolan said, "Lydia, I love you, and that includes the love I had for the child."
"It doesn’t matter if we don’t have kids. I just want you."
Young love is intense.
So intense that it made me forget my pain.
But young love is also fleeting.
In just five years, he had a child.
With another woman.
