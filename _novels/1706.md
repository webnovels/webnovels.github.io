I am Jo Miller, and my daughter is the community's golden girl, the poster child for filial devotion. Yet, on Christmas Eve, I signed the papers to legally sever our bond.
The mediators from the local Family Services office rotated through, trying to talk sense into me.
"Your daughter, Daisy, she's devoted, Jo. Never gave you a moment's worry growing up. She visits every other weekend, never comes empty-handed."
"What is wrong with you? You’ve got one foot in the grave, Jo, what in God's name are you doing severing ties?"
I stood my ground. I used a fireplace poker to drive Daisy out of the house.
She wept, refusing to leave, and then, from the fourth-floor window of my old apartment, she threw herself out.
I walked past her body. She was lying in a pool of blood, fingers frantically trying to clutch the hem of my jeans.
I took a step back. "Try to bleed out somewhere else."
The neighbors couldn’t bear to watch. They called me a monster, wrapped me in a blanket, and drove me to the hospital.
When Daisy woke up, intubated and broken, all she could do was whisper "I’m sorry" over and over again.
I didn't look at her. The next morning, I filed the final papers for the Petition for Familial Severance.

1
The Petition for Familial Severance hearing is straightforward.
The petitioner asks three questions. If the respondent—the person being disowned—answers even one question correctly, the petition is denied.
On the day of the hearing, Daisy was wheeled onto the platform by a kindly neighbor.
She was skeletal, her face the color of wet plaster. Her hospital gown hung loosely on a frame of jutting bones.
When she saw me, her voice was a rough whisper. "Mom…"
I turned my head, refusing to meet her eyes.
The Mediation Panel seemed annoyed by my callousness. Their pointed whispers and judgmental sighs drilled into my ears.
"Silence," the Judge’s voice was clipped. "The hearing is now in session. Joanne Miller, you will begin the questioning. Are you prepared?"
I nodded.
There was no preamble, no polite softening. I went straight for the throat.
"My first question."
"Why did I first hit you?"
Daisy’s eyes held a knowing, theatrical sadness. "Because I skipped school."
She sighed, her expression shifting to one of tragedy. "Dad had just been hospitalized in the ICU after his accident. We had no income. You were up all night, every night, so worried. I was trying to help, Mom. I was secretly skipping classes to work, and you caught me. You slapped me."
"Oh, that's right! I remember that night. These old walls are thin. They were yelling so loud, my husband even went over to intervene."
"Skipping school is wrong, yes, but it came from a good place! She was trying to help her parents. No mother should hit her child for that."
"Exactly. Sweet Daisy was on the floor after that slap, shaking, but she pulled out five hundred dollars—money she'd earned—and begged her mother not to be angry. It broke my heart!"
The murmurs, though low, were perfectly audible.
I didn't blink. I just spoke two words. "Pathetic."
The shockwave was instantaneous.
Before Daisy could reply, the chorus of her defenders erupted.
"Pathetic? Does this woman deserve to be a mother? Her daughter sacrifices her education to make money for the family, and you have the nerve to call it pathetic?"
"She's lucky to have such an angel! I say skip the trial. Grant the severance immediately before she bleeds her daughter dry in old age!"
I gave a dry, humorless chuckle. "Fine by me. Let's sever. It saves us all time."
But fear flashed in Daisy’s eyes. She lunged, sliding dramatically from her wheelchair, her face a streaked mess of tears and snot. "No… Mom, no, you can’t sever the bond…"
Some people turned away, unable to watch; others glared at me with dagger-sharp contempt. The Judge looked down at Daisy, her expression pure pity.
When they confirmed Daisy wasn’t injured from the fall, everyone sighed in collective relief.
"Mom, that was the first time you ever hit me, the first time you ever lost your temper over my schooling. I never forgot it. After that, I was a model student. You drove me to and from school every day, even getting up at five a.m. for my last two years of high school. The only thing you ever talked about was my education."
She gazed at me, trembling.
I said nothing, slowly turning my head to face the Judge.
The Judge's pity hadn’t yet left her eyes, but it instantly chilled when she glanced at me. She shuffled through her notes, pulling up the "obvious" answer, but her pupils narrowed sharply as she read the card.
"The answer… the answer is… incorrect."

"H-How is that possible? Mom, are you doing this on purpose? Are you trying to lie just so you can sever our ties?"
Daisy furiously shook the wheels of her chair, turning to the Panel.
"Mrs. Peterson, Mr. Harrison, you've been our neighbors for twenty years. You know what happened."
"They certainly do," I cut in, my voice calm. "But Daisy, do you remember what happened in our home just before I first struck you?"
Her eyes were glossy with unshed tears, and she spoke tentatively.
"Dad was critically injured and in the hospital."
"That evening, I was mugged on my way home from evening study. When Dad found out, he confronted the guys, and they retaliated. They beat him into the ICU. It was my fault. I ruined him. After he was hospitalized, I didn’t want to live. I took an overdose of sleeping pills that night, and to be sure, I cut my wrists."
She pulled up her sleeve, exposing a web of hideous, jagged scars on her inner wrist. The tears finally spilled over.
The low murmur of the Panel stopped, replaced by a heavy, profound wave of sympathy.
I could feel my fingers starting to shake at the memory. I squeezed them into my palms, digging in my nails.
Daisy’s voice was a plea.
"Mom, you never left my side. You stayed up all night to watch me. You dragged me to every therapist and specialist in the city because you were terrified I'd hurt myself again. You told me you would sell the house, sell your blood, do anything, just to make me well."
"You loved me so much then… Why… why have you brought us here today?"
Before she finished speaking, sniffles and muted sobs rose from the Panel. Everyone was moved by the tragic history of my daughter. All of the agony my husband and I endured for her was seen as a simple parental obligation.
I remembered the day Rob was moved from the Critical Care Unit to a regular room. He squeezed my hand and begged me to take care of our girl. He made me promise so many things.
I did every one of them.
"So, Mom, after all that, what is your answer?" Daisy prompted, pulling me back to the present.
"You were dating." My answer was blunt.
Daisy stared, speechless.
Her high school guidance counselor laughed with disbelief.
"Joanne Miller, you are an outrageous liar! Daisy was my student! Ours was an all-girls' academy, you forget? For a mother to invent a sexual smear against her own daughter in a court of law… that is pure malice! Are you even her mother?"
Everyone in the room fixed me with hateful, murderous stares.
"Are you finished?" My voice was level. I turned my head slightly, catching Daisy’s face. "You tell them."
"Was it random thugs who put your father in the ICU, or was it your boyfriend, Mitch Sullivan?"

Daisy’s lips pressed into a tight line. She shook her head back and forth like a frantic metronome. She stammered. "I… I…"
"Second question," I cut her off coldly.
"Why did I insist you attend a local university after high school?"
The question wasn't difficult. We lived in Boston. Most kids stayed local for the excellent colleges. The day she got her acceptance, the neighbors praised her for staying close to care for me.
But was that the truth?
With me and her teachers watching her, Daisy made it through high school. But in college, failing grades became the norm. She was facing expulsion.
I swallowed my pride and went to a college friend I hadn't spoken to in thirty years. I leveraged his connection to reach an obscure intermediary. That person led me to the Dean of Daisy’s department.
I had no money, no connections of value.
I just drove out to his home with baskets of fresh, small-farm produce and volunteered to clean his house, even helping to care for his bedridden mother.
I constantly mentioned Daisy to him, painting her as a devoted, hardworking student who was distracted by having to care for her ailing father—a man in a vegetative state—and manage the household, using this as an excuse for her grades.
Daisy's fabricated "devotion" made the Dean relent.
Afterward, I stayed on to care for his elderly mother, refusing payment. But the Dean was a good man; he started paying me a generous salary, enough to finally cover Rob's staggering monthly hospital bills. He even took an interest in Daisy, offering her an internship and a place at the City Research Institute after graduation.
I thought my years of sacrifice were finally paying off.
But Daisy refused every one of the Dean’s job offers.
The reason she gave? That my excessive control wouldn't allow her to leave.
She even managed to get me fired, losing my primary income, simply by casually mentioning in front of the Dean that I had scolded her for giving his mother too many potatoes, which she claimed I did out of spite.
I looked at Daisy's worried frown. I was genuinely curious how she would spin this.
"You made me stay local because of your control issues. You wanted to keep me close."
Her voice was thick with manufactured injury. Large, fat tears dropped onto the floor, splattering onto the Panel’s hearts.
"Mom, I’m an adult now. I have my own mind. I listened to you for twenty years, but I have my own family now, my own child. You can’t chain me up for the rest of my life…"
Her eyes were red and fixed on me. She spoke each syllable with deliberate clarity. "Mom, I am not your accessory. I am my own person."
"Well said!" someone whispered, triggering a wave of hushed agreement.
The looks directed at me twisted from suspicion and dissatisfaction to outright fury and disgust. The entire room supported her, and the weight of their judgment pressed down on me.
I quickly glanced at Daisy, not pausing for a second. "Yes. You’re right."
Before she could smile, I continued. "But you’re only half-right."
Everyone, including Daisy, was confused.
"I made you stay local, not to keep you close to me, but to keep you away from Mitch Sullivan."
I turned my gaze toward the corner of the room where he sat.
Following my eyes, everyone else stared, too. The noisy whispers died instantly, replaced by a thick silence.
Mitch Sullivan was no stranger. He was a local thug, known for dozens of petty crimes and violence. A born piece of trash.

"Hey! What the hell is that supposed to mean? You’re here to sever ties with your daughter! Leave me out of your crazy drama!"
"Besides, I’m a changed man! Everyone rebels when they're young. Your daughter isn't fifteen, she’s thirty-five! She has the right to decide who she dates! What right do you have to interfere?"
His words spewed out like machine-gun fire.
I was here to sever ties with my daughter. I saw no reason to engage with a lowlife like him.
Seeing my silence, Mitch gave a sneering, knowing "Ohhh."
"I get it now. You haven't had any male attention in years, so you’re jealous your own daughter does. If you’re that desperate, Jo, go find someone! Don't lock your daughter up just because you can't stand seeing her happy."
A wave of titters and whispers ran through the Panel.
They furrowed their brows at his crude words, but I saw them slowly nodding in agreement.
Someone in the crowd chimed in.
"She’s right! The mother slandered her daughter, claiming she was dating in high school, and she's still interfering in college! She just can’t stand to see her daughter happy. Competing with your own child is disgusting."
"That mother is a control freak. This girl was totally messed up by that home, yet she still doesn't want to sever ties! If it were me, I’d have cut her off years ago."
"I can tell by her face she’s the kind of mother who will sleep between the bride and groom on their wedding night."
Daisy just sat there listening, neither confirming nor denying, a calculated look in her eyes.
The tidal wave of condemnation grew louder. I bit my lip, my fingertips curling. I tried to stand to defend myself, but the room went black, and I collapsed back into the sofa.
Daisy was instantly at my side, her eyes red, her voice choked with sobs.
"Please, please don't say those things."
"Yes, my mother secretly hid Mitch’s boxers and tore up our photos, but she didn’t mean to hurt us! She’s just so lonely…"
That one sentence launched me right into the eye of the storm.
I was like a criminal in ancient times, paraded through the streets—cursed, spat on, and shamed by everyone. Someone in the chaotic crowd actually spat toward me.
Daisy turned back to me, smiling sickeningly. She patted my hand, her voice syrupy sweet. "It’s okay, Mom. Everyone understands."
The curses, the mockery—it was all behind a thick pane of glass. I was alone, hearing only the frantic drumming of my own heart.
Something inside me fractured in that moment.
I violently shook off her hand, raising my voice to reclaim the space. "Daisy Miller, you also got the second question wrong."
The smile froze on her face. She quickly reverted to her pitiful, vulnerable look.
"The final question," I said, my hand trembling as I held the microphone.
"Why have I not spoken a single word to you in ten years?"
She didn't hesitate. "Because I married Mitch Sullivan."
I shook my head slowly. "Yes, and no."
Daisy’s fingers clenched the armrests of the wheelchair. Her voice was laced with impatience.
"What do you want, Mom? Are you going to be satisfied with anything I say?"
"If Dad knew how you were treating me today, he would hate you."
The rigid wall I’d built up since entering the courtroom finally cracked. The tears I’d held back for so long flooded my eyes. With shaking hands, I pushed the button on the remote to play the security footage.
Everyone gasped at the scene that appeared on the screen.
