Back in my office, Lucy carefully brought in some tea.

"Ms. Green, should I look into the specific flow of that fund?"

"Do it. As detailed as possible."

Two days later, Lucy brought a stack of photos, her hands trembling.

"Ms. Green, take a look at this."

In the photos, Ethan and Olivia were coming out of a high-end French restaurant. Olivia was helping Ethan adjust his shirt collar.

They were laughing happily, and Ethan's hand was on Olivia's shoulder.

"When was this taken?" I picked up the photo to examine closely.

"Last night at 9:20 PM." Lucy pulled out her phone.

"I followed them until 10:30 PM before they left separately."

I clearly remembered that last night when I texted Ethan, he said he was working late on files and his phone was about to die.

"Anything else?"

Lucy took out another stack of documents: "This is Mr. Parker's schedule for the past week."

I flipped through page by page, getting angrier with each one.

The schedule said he was meeting important clients, but the actual locations all matched Olivia's activity tracks.

"This bastard!" I threw the documents on the table.

"Ms. Green, there's something even worse." Lucy played a recording on her phone.

"I recorded this in the break room yesterday."

Olivia's voice came through the recording: "Mr. Parker looked so handsome in that navy suit last night, much more manly than usual."

Another female voice asked: "What's really going on between you two?"

Olivia gave a light laugh: "You know."

I smashed the water glass on the floor, shattering it to pieces.

"Keep investigating! I want to know their every move!"

The next day, I decided to test Olivia myself.

I cornered her in the design department's break room.

"How was the French dinner yesterday?" I asked deliberately.

Olivia was making coffee. Hearing this, her hand shook, spilling coffee grounds all over the table.

"What... what French dinner?" She nervously cleaned up the mess.

"Don't pretend." I walked closer to her.

"That place by the river last night. Pretty good, wasn't it?"

Olivia's face turned pale instantly, then she forced a smile.

"Oh, that. It was nice. Mr. Parker said he enjoyed it too."

As soon as she finished speaking, she realized she had slipped up and immediately shut her mouth.

"Is that so?" I stared into her eyes.

"Didn't Ethan say he was working late last night?"

"I... I..." Olivia stammered.

"Maybe I remembered wrong."

"Remembered wrong?" I sneered.

"Or have you gotten so used to your dates that you forgot to keep them secret?"

"Ms. Green, you've misunderstood!" Olivia was sweating profusely.

"Mr. Parker and I really just have a work relationship!"

"Work?" I took out my phone and showed her the photo Lucy sent me.

"Is this work too?"

In the photo, Ethan and Olivia were laughing and chatting in the restaurant. Olivia was intimately wiping the corner of Ethan's mouth.

Olivia's face went completely white when she saw the photo. "This... this is..."

"What is this?" I held the phone in front of her face.

"Care to explain?"

Olivia opened her mouth but couldn't say a word.

Just then, Ethan pushed open the door: "What are you two talking about?"

"About your date." I showed him the phone directly.

"Care to explain?"

Ethan's face changed when he saw the photo.

But he quickly regained composure.

"What's there to explain?" He even acted righteous.

"Olivia and I were discussing the project over dinner. Is there a problem?"

"Does discussing a project require feeding each other?" I pointed at the photo.

"Is this what you call discussing a project?"

"That was... that was an accident." Olivia started to panic.

"We were talking about the design plan, and I had papers in my hand, so..."

"So you fed him by accident?" I sneered.

"Olivia Wilson, do you think I'm an idiot?"

"Rachel, you're overthinking this." Ethan started to act gentle.

"Olivia and I really just have a work relationship."

"Is that so?" I took out another photo.

"Then how do you explain this?"
