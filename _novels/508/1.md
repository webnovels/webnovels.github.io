It was an ordinary Tuesday until I noticed something unusual in the studio's account.

Three million dollars, gone.

"Lucy!" I called out.

Lucy Liu hurried in, looking flustered. "Yes, Ms. Green..."

"Where's the $3 million from the Starlight Design Fund?" I slammed the bank statement on the desk.

"It... it was approved for transfer by Mr. Parker." Lucy was trembling as she spoke.

"He approved what? That was my dedicated design project fund!" My voice rose several octaves.

"Mr. Parker said it was a temporary loan..."

"Temporary loan?" I stood up abruptly.

"What right does he have to touch my money?"

Lucy took half a step back in fear. "Ms. Green, I was just following Mr. Parker's instructions..."

"Get out!"

Ethan Parker, my fiancé, was also the general manager of Inspired Creations Advertising.

We had been dating for four years and were supposed to get married next month.

Now it seemed that wedding needed to be reconsidered.

I stormed straight to his office.

Ethan was organizing some files. When he saw me burst in, the pen in his hand fell to the floor.

"Where's my money?" I walked up to his desk, both hands on the surface.

"What money?" His gaze shifted.

"Don't play dumb! The $3 million from the Starlight Design Fund!" My voice was so loud the next office could probably hear.

Ethan stood up, adjusting his tie. "Lower your voice. What will the colleagues think?"

"I want everyone to hear!" I pointed at him.

"What did you do with my money without my permission?"

"Oh, that money." Ethan said nonchalantly.

"Olivia's new project needed some startup funds, so I borrowed it temporarily. I'll return it this week."

"Borrowed?" I sneered.

"Is $3 million just pocket change to you?"

"We're getting married soon. Why be so particular?" Ethan was getting impatient.

"Don't you trust me?"

"Married?" My voice got even louder.

"Does being married mean you can take each other's money as you please?"

Just then, Olivia knocked and entered.

She was the studio's assistant designer, admittedly quite attractive, with a very approachable demeanor.

"What's going on? I could hear arguing from the hallway." Olivia pretended to look concerned.

"Perfect timing, Olivia." Ethan immediately changed his attitude.

"Explain to Rachel why your project needs that startup capital."

Olivia immediately put on a pitiful expression, her eyes reddening.

"Ms. Green, it's all my fault for not being capable enough. The project ran into difficulties."

"If we didn't urgently need these funds, I wouldn't have troubled Mr. Parker..."

"You troubled him?" I stared at Olivia.

"Did you know that was my personal fund?"

"I... I didn't know." Olivia lowered her head.

"I thought it was the studio's working capital. I'm really sorry!"

"If sorry was enough, we wouldn't need contracts, would we?" My voice was cold as ice.

Ethan suddenly slammed the table: "Enough, Rachel! Olivia has apologized. What more do you want?"

"What do I want?" I turned to him.

"I want my money, right now!"

"I don't have it now!" Ethan shouted back.

"The funds have already been invested in the project. We have to wait until this week to recover them!"

"This week? What if the project fails?"

"It won't fail." Olivia hurriedly said.

"I guarantee the project will succeed."

"You guarantee?" I looked at her.

"What can you use as collateral?"

Olivia opened her mouth but couldn't say a word.

"It must be repaid this week," I pointed at Ethan.

"Not a penny less!"

I left, but turned back at the door.

"Oh, and in the future, you'd better get my permission before touching my money!"
