I grew up poor, financing college with student loans, while my roommate was a rich kid who'd never worked a day in his life.

But from day one of freshman year, he was dead set on being my friend.

He took me out, showed me a good time, and even introduced me to his inner circle—including Scarlett.

Then Brandon flipped when Scarlett and I actually started seeing each other.

He intentionally knocked over my meal plan tray, then claimed I'd burned him and demanded compensation.

After I gave him every cent I had, he spread lies that I was a thief—specifically, that I'd stolen his Louis Vuitton wallet.

The school put me on academic probation, classmates froze me out, and even Scarlett wanted out.

She called me a loser with delusions of grandeur, saying I was way out of my league.

I couldn't fight back. Ostracized and broken, I dropped out and tried to drown myself when my mind finally gave out.

But when I opened my eyes, I was back to the day Brandon first introduced me to Scarlett.
