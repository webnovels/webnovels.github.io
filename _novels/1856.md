The moment my husband Liam entered me, the lubricated passage didn’t bring the expected pleasure.
Instead, it was a searing, burning pain.
I panicked, trying to get up.
Suddenly a figure crawled out from under the bed—it was Liam’s female friend, Chloe.
“Bro, you actually did it! That’s my bestie!”
I stared at them in disbelief.
Chloe waggled a bottle of mustard at me.
"Liam lost a dare, he had to swap the lube for mustard. You're not mad about it, are you?"
Liam tilted his head slightly, a smug smirk plastered across his face.
"Don't worry, she can take it. She practically begged me to trap myself in this marriage, so she needs to be a little more understanding."
I was in too much pain to straighten up. 
Fine. If this is a cage, I'll smash it to pieces.

I hailed a cab to the hospital, not looking back.
Behind me, I could still hear the mingled jeers and laughter of men and women.
Liam, I've truly had enough this time.
I clenched my jaw, enduring the searing pain 'down there' as I checked in, desperate not to let anyone notice anything wrong.
Sweat dripped from my forehead.
But when I reached the OB/GYN waiting room, there was already a long line.
"Excuse me, how much longer will it be?"
The older nurse shot me an impatient glare.
"What's the hurry? You were having such a blast doing it, weren't you? Now you can't even wait a minute?"
I leaned against the wall, my pale face reflected in the window.
I wanted to curse, but I didn't even have the strength to speak.
My phone vibrated. It was a message from Liam.
I thought back; he hadn't messaged me in almost half a year.
My hands trembled as I unlocked my phone.
He sent me a business card for a gynecologist.
My traitorous heart skipped a beat.
I hastily contacted the doctor he recommended.
"You must be Aubrey, right?"
He helped me onto the cold examination bed.
"Relax, just take off your pants."
The room was vast, so vast it made me anxious.
I forced myself to ask.
"Is there a female doctor available?"
I couldn't read his expression behind the mask.
But I had a vague, unsettling feeling that he wasn't exactly friendly.
"To a doctor, there's no difference between men and women, it's all just flesh. What's the big deal?"
"Liam always said you were a handful. Guess he wasn't kidding."
I bit down hard on my lower lip, until the metallic taste of blood in my mouth snapped me back to reality.
Following his instruction, I lay naked on the machine.
Suddenly.
A burst of laughter echoed from above.
My shame reached its peak at that moment.
"What's so funny?!" I screamed it.
"So, things aren't exactly harmonious in your bedroom with Liam, huh?"
"So desperate for 'fun' you're using mustard to spice things up? "
"No wonder Liam dragged us to Chloe's place on your wedding night. Honestly, you're pretty loose 'down there.' I know a great doctor who does tightening procedures, want me to send you their number?"
My brain exploded in a buzzing haze.
"Liam was with Chloe on our wedding night?"
But on our wedding night, the next morning, I woke up to Liam sitting neatly beside my bed, looking at me so tenderly.
He pulled a jeweled necklace from his pocket.
And with such deep affection, he placed it around my neck.
"That ring you lost yesterday wasn't good enough for you. I bought this overseas at an auction overnight. Only the most dazzling gem in the world is worthy of my Aubrey."
I was utterly moved.
"Everyone always knew Liam and Chloe were meant to be. You're the one who got in the way."
Whether it was revenge or unintentional, I couldn't tell.
The spray of medicine on my intimate area sent a searing, gut-wrenching pain through me.
Tears streamed down my cheeks, splashing onto the floor.
When I got home, clutching the medicine, Chloe was perched on Liam's lap, taking bites directly from whatever he was eating.
I stormed over, grabbed Chloe by her hair, and with all my strength, slapped her twice.
Chloe's cheeks swelled up grotesquely, making her look ridiculous.
But I still didn't feel satisfied.
Before I could even raise my hand again, Liam kicked me across the room.
"Enough!"
His eyes burned with pure disgust and revulsion as he looked at me.
"Aubrey, what the hell is wrong with you?!"
"Chloe already explained, it was just a dare."
