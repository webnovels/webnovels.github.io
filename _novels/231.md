"A week before my wedding, my fiancé used my younger brother’s frozen embryos to get knocked up.

She even had the nerve to flaunt the ultrasound on social media, captioning it, “So blessed that our love will live on in this special way.”

Barf!

My brother, that snake, commented, “Meeting you was the luckiest day of my life.”

My mom, ever the opportunist, chimed in, “Honey, you deserve the world! That condo we bought for him? Put it solely in your name!”

I simply commented: “Congrats.”

Bitch called me immediately, screaming, “Your brother can’t have kids anymore, so what’s the big deal? Besides, it's still a Song kid! Why are you being such a petty jerk?”

I chuckled, dialing a number I hadn’t called in years.

“Wanna elope?”"
