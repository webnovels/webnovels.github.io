Damon’s plan went smoothly.

I had no strength left to fight, not even a tiny bit.

The doctor took my heart and left with his team.

I tried with every last ounce of will, but I couldn't move my hands, chained to the table. All I wanted was to touch my baby at the very end of my life.

Even though he was no longer in my body, even though he was just a blood clot now…

He was my baby!

I just wanted to touch him, to tell him not to be scared.

A monstrous wave of grief drowned me. My wrists strained against the restraints, leaving only raw, bloody streaks.

Damon had told me before that after he was reborn, he needed to protect the story’s heroine. Only if she was happy could he continue to live.

But he’d also said I was his one and only, that when it came to anything *within* our relationship, he would always be loyal to me.

It was only for things *outside* the scope of our love that he would try to ensure Ivy’s happiness.

I had trusted him so completely.

I never imagined he would go to such lengths for Ivy.

Even without a heart, it felt like a thousand knives were tearing through my chest.

Just then, the door burst open with a bang.

Damon appeared, frantic, his eyes red-rimmed. “Willow! My Willow, I’m so late! Oh God, your chest…”

My body remained limp, showing no signs of consciousness, but he didn’t stop his performance.

He clutched my hand, tightly, then barked orders at the people behind him. “Spare no expense! Find those who hurt my Willow, make them pay!”

“And immediately find the world’s top specialists! Give Willow the best artificial heart! If she doesn’t live, I’ll make you all regret it!”

My soul was calm, numb. Only hatred surged within my empty chest cavity now.

I hated that man.

I was rushed to the hospital.

Just as Damon had promised, the world’s top artificial heart team began my treatment.

During this time, my broken limbs and ravaged body also needed treatment.

It was three months before I, barely clinging to life, was finally transferred from the ICU to a regular room.

Damon stayed by my side day and night, never leaving, showering me with care.

When the doctor said I would never be able to have children again, Damon teared up, his voice filled with feigned sorrow. He gripped my hand, repeating, “It’s all my fault, Willow, all my fault! I didn’t find you in time! I don’t care that you can’t have children anymore. I promise I’ll be good to you!”

In the past, I would have gently told him not to shoulder all the blame.

But *he* cared?

What right did he have to care?

Everything was *his* doing!

Just seeing him made me tremble with rage. So, I pretended to sleep every day, refusing to look at him.

Once my condition stabilized, more visitors began to arrive.

And finally, one day, I saw the person I least wanted to see.

“Damon, darling, I’ve come to see you.”

It was Ivy.

“I was so heartbroken to hear about Willow. You must have been so sad, unable to sleep, Damon. I brought you some ginseng soup.”

Ivy held out a thermos. Damon took it. “Thank you. I’ll feed Willow first, then I’ll drink it.”

“Ginseng soup is most effective when hot.” Ivy’s soft voice chimed.

Damon hesitated for a moment, then relented to Ivy.

Damon always said that when it came to our relationship, he was loyal only to me.

He claimed that even when he occasionally helped Ivy, it was only to make her a little happier, all so he could stay with me for a few more years.

But look at the way he gazed at Ivy – with such tenderness.

I used to lie to myself, convincing myself he treated her well only to extend our time together.

But looking at him now, who was the person he truly longed to stay with?

After finishing the ginseng soup, Damon received a call from the doctor and left in a hurry.

The room was suddenly empty, save for Ivy and me.

Ivy smiled, pulling up a chair beside my bed, and fiddled with my IV line. “Are you awake, Willow?”

I opened my eyes and stared at her, emotionless.

Ivy’s smile was sickeningly sweet. “I heard you had quite the… pleasure, Willow. Served by a dozen strong men for three days and three nights. To survive that? You really have nine lives!”

“Nine lives, indeed. As long as I’m alive, you’ll never be Mrs. King, will you? That must be agonizing for you, right?”

I’d always known Ivy had feelings for Damon, but I’d never exposed it, hampered by the fact that Damon needed to appease her to survive.

Sure enough, at my words, Ivy’s expression darkened instantly, as if I’d struck a nerve. “What’s so great about you, a woman with an artificial heart? Do you know, your heart was given to my ‘sister’ by Damon? And actually, I don’t even have a sister. I just mentioned it casually, and Damon dug out your heart for me.”

I remained unmoved. My heart was already gone; whether it went to her or to a dog made no difference to me.

Seeing my lack of reaction, Ivy continued, “Just two days ago, I got into Iris’s dance company. Damon introduced me.”

I froze.

Iris’s dance company was world-renowned, and they had plans to recruit one American dancer this year.

Before the accident, they had contacted me. Even after I told them about my pregnancy plans, they hadn’t withdrawn their offer, saying they would keep the spot open for me.

Dance was my dream. Even though I loved Damon so much, I had only quietly postponed this dream for the sake of having a child.

How could Damon give *my* place to Ivy?!

“That spot belongs to me!”

I tried to sit up, but Ivy looked at me like I was the most pathetic creature on earth. She pulled out my IV line and all the other life-sustaining machines.

“Willow, look at your shattered limbs and your fragile, artificial heart. What makes you think you can compete with me? Not just this spot, but Damon too, he’ll be mine. Just you wait!”
