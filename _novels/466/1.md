“This woman is tough as nails, still fighting after three whole days! My damn legs are practically jelly, hahaha!”

On the dissection table of that shady clinic, countless men came and went.

They’d injected me with some kind of drug, pinning me down so I couldn't move an inch. All I could do was lie there, enduring the mechanical, repulsive acts of those vile men.

“Where’s the doctor? Didn’t they say we were supposed to harvest her organs after we were done? Where are they?”

Amidst the chaos of voices, I faintly heard Damon’s voice again.

“Once they’re finished, go in and take the organs, just like I told you!”

The doctor’s voice trembled. “Mr. King, please, let’s just stop. Your wife has suffered enough already…”

“No!” Damon’s voice was firm, unwavering. “In the original story, Ivy was first assaulted, then had her organs harvested. Every step must be followed, no exceptions!”

Hearing that, my world shattered around me.

Damon and I had been married for three years, our love as vibrant as ever.

That very morning, when I left for the clinic alone, Damon had insisted on driving me, warning me about the ‘unsafe’ backroads. I thought he was worried. Now I know he was just making sure those monsters didn’t miss their target.

Another man climbed off me. My limbs were shattered, my body completely ravaged. I was at the absolute limit of my endurance.

Suddenly, a sharp pain tore through my lower abdomen, an uncontrolled spasm that ripped through me.

“What the hell is this?”

The doctor rushed in from the doorway, taking one look and gasping. “This… she’s *pregnant*?!”

“…”

The room fell silent. Even the kidnappers, who’d been laughing hysterically moments before, seemed stunned by the sight.

My baby… it was gone. It had left my body.

Even the animals who had relentlessly tortured me for three days fell silent.

But my own heart was filled with a soul-numbing grief, so profound it left me utterly numb. Only tears streamed freely down my face.

When I first learned Damon only had three years to live unless Ivy was happy, I had desperately focused on my health, drinking countless cups of vile-tasting herbal teas, all to ensure I could conceive this child so smoothly.

Now, this child, who had only just arrived – I’d only found out about him a few days ago – was ripped away from me in such a brutal, horrifying way.

“Why did you stop?” Damon’s voice came from outside, confused by the sudden silence.

He must have thought the special drug he’d injected me with made me deaf, because he spoke without any attempt to hide his words.

The doctor’s voice was shaky, almost filled with pity. “Mr. Ki-King, your wife… she…”

“Enough!” Damon’s impatient voice cut him off. “Don’t tell me what she looks like now! I don’t want to hear it! It’ll kill me!”

“Your wife is in a critical condition, Mr. King. I believe we should terminate the plan and provide immediate medical assistance.” the doctor advised.

Damon was silent for a moment.

Just as I thought his heart might finally soften, his voice returned, colder than ice.

“Start the organ harvesting. Begin with the heart!”

The doctor froze, dumbfounded. “The heart? Mr. King, that’s impossible! Without her heart, your wife…”

“Of course I know the heart is vital! Do you think I don’t feel pain? She’s my lover!”

Damon roared, his voice filled with a performative anguish. “But it *has* to be done to this extent! If Willow doesn’t take this hit for Ivy, Ivy will be on the brink of death, and then *I* will truly die!”

“If I die, who will give Ivy happiness?”

“Just take the heart! Ivy’s sister needs it, and the other organs must follow the plot. Once it’s all over, I’ll immediately bring people to rescue her and send her to the hospital for an artificial heart transplant.”

Damon’s voice was calm, steady, as if he’d planned this all out long ago.

The doctor sighed, motioning for his assistant to bring out the professional tools.

My soul was trapped, screaming silently within my broken, exhausted body. But the sharp blade sliced into my chest regardless.
