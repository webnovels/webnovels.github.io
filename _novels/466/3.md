Ivy left, and Damon didn’t return.

I didn’t want to die, but Ivy had disconnected all the wires of my life support.

Without the machines, my life would quickly fade.

I struggled, trying to press the nurse’s call button, but my broken limbs couldn’t even manage that simple movement.

By the time the nurse found me during her rounds, I was once again in critical condition, barely clinging to life.

My situation rapidly deteriorated. The specialists who had previously treated me had left after my condition stabilized, and the doctors at this hospital, despite their best efforts, couldn’t maintain my vital signs.

“Where’s Mr. King? Get him here now! The situation is critical, he needs to sign the critical illness notice and contact the specialists!”

“And we can only begin rescue efforts once a family member signs and acknowledges the risks!”

“Mr. King seemed to be dropping off Ms. Ivy earlier. Ms. Ivy said it was hard to get a cab from there, so I assume Mr. King drove her himself.”

Hearing the conversation outside the room, my mind went blank.

I didn’t want to die.

I struggled, “Call him, tell him to come back…”

The doctors seemed to realize. “Quick, call him!”

Only my phone had Damon’s number, so they used it to dial.

The call was answered quickly, but after the doctor explained my situation, Damon’s voice was utterly devoid of emotion.

“I’m taking Ivy home right now. I don’t have time to come back and sign anything.”

The doctors were stunned. Taking a casual friend home versus his wife’s life – wasn't the choice obvious?

“Mr. King, you might not have heard clearly. Someone just stopped the machines. Your wife’s artificial heart is failing, and the risk is extremely high. If we don’t act now, she could die at any moment! We need the contact information for the specialists you had before, and you need to come back! This is about your wife’s life!”

Damon’s impatience grew even more obvious. “Stop playing games with Willow! Ivy just left her room, and she was perfectly fine. How could she suddenly be critically ill?”

“And when Ivy came out, she even had two slaps on her face! She had enough strength to *hit* someone, but couldn’t reconnect her own life support? Give the phone to Willow.”

The doctor hesitated, then placed the phone near me.

I barely had the strength to speak. “Damon… save me…”

Silence stretched on the other end of the line.

It lasted so long that I thought Damon had heard the weakness in my voice. But when he finally spoke, it was a condemnation.

“That’s a terrible act, Willow. I know you’re jealous. Why I’m good to Ivy… if others don’t know, how can *you* not? I’m doing this so we can stay together for even longer, you understand, don’t you?”

“No… it’s not… I really…”

“Stop playing games, Willow. Be good. I’ll come back to you once I’ve dropped Ivy off. She’s a girl, it’s not safe for her to walk alone at night. Wait for me, I’ll be back soon.”

I was bewildered, helpless, my heart turning to ashes.

Why would he misunderstand me?

In the past, when he was good to Ivy, had I ever been jealous?

I was truly dying…

“Damon!”

The urgent desire to live made me call out his name, stopping him from hanging up.

“Please come back, please save me. I need you right now… please…”

Tears streamed down my face.

My desperate plea, stripping away all dignity, only bought me less than five seconds of silence from Damon.

Suddenly, Ivy’s voice came through the phone.

“I’m sorry, Damon. Maybe I should just go home by myself. I feel so bad that Willow misunderstood and put you in such a difficult position. Just pull over, I can walk… it’s fine, nothing bad will happen in broad daylight.”

Damon’s voice filled with tenderness. “Just sit still, don’t move when the car hasn’t stopped… Willow, be good. I know you’re fine. I’ll be back to you very soon, just half an hour.”

Damon hung up, leaving me and a silent resuscitation room.

I wanted to live, but he thought I just wanted his company?

I truly didn’t want to die, but what could I do now?

Overwhelmed by anger and despair, I suddenly coughed violently. All the machines attached to me shrieked frantically.

The medical staff rushed over. Even without a signed consent, they began resuscitation efforts. But what was the use?

My artificial heart was failing. I was dying.

I gripped one of the doctor’s hands. “Tell Damon…”


Damon had just arrived at Ivy’s house when a sudden chill ran through him, as if he’d lost something incredibly important.

And the chill deepened.

Ivy was showing Damon her dance outfits. “For the Iris company performance, I’ve got a few options. Which one do you think looks best, Damon?”

Damon barely glanced at them. The growing dread made him restless.

He suddenly had an overwhelming urge to see Willow.

He didn't know why, just a sudden, urgent need to see her.

Just then, his phone rang.

It was a doctor from the hospital.

“Mr. King, I’m sorry to inform you. Your wife’s artificial heart just failed. Resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful. She has passed away.”

Damon shot to his feet, his face etched with disbelief. “What did you say?!”

Ivy jumped, flinching back. “Damon? What’s wrong?”

Damon’s fear exploded. He felt it was a lie, yet an unsettling premonition gnawed at him.
