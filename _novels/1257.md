My high-achieving brother became a self-made billionaire. I, on the other hand, was vying for "Funniest Heir of the Year" with my personal philosophy: The Butt-Slide Down the Mountain.

The family couldn't stomach it anymore, so they shoved a suitable bride from a prominent family my way.

On our wedding night, I looked at my stunningly beautiful new wife, Seraphina Beaumont, and embraced my philosophy of 'lying flat.' I sprawled on the bed and waved a dismissive hand.

"I’m exhausted. You can handle the family quota from here. Just let me know when we hit goal."

The next afternoon, my parents' frantic, consecutive calls blasted me awake. My new wife had gone out to a party.

When I reached the private room, she was in the middle of what looked like a challenge with her male best friend, Brandon Cole, to break the Guinness World Record for the longest kiss.

Seeing me, Brandon awkwardly pulled away.

"Don't get the wrong idea, Leo. Truth or Dare."

My eyes fell on the split corner of her lip. I pulled out my phone.

"Oh, I thought maybe your family also had a reproductive quota."

I raised my phone, flashing a cynical smile.

"Just a friendly reminder," I said, snapping a photo of the two of them.

"The stork requires a standing ovation, not just a lock of lips!"

They shielded their eyes from the flash and jerked apart. I offered a lazy, unapologetic shrug.

"My bad. Forgot to turn off the flash."

The private room immediately erupted in noisy explanations.

Seraphina's face shifted from pale to crimson.

"I didn't! This—this is a cut I just got! Brandon was putting salve on it!" she insisted, pointing furiously at her damaged lip.

My friends and hers rushed to back her up.

"It's true, Sinclair! Look at her lip. She lost the dare, so we were all chanting, messing around."

"Seriously, Leo, the Guinness Record is over five hours. How could they possibly be trying to break it?"

"We—we accidentally shoved Sera into Brandon's arms! Don't get the wrong idea!"

I pocketed my phone, yawned, and even squeezed out a couple of physiological tears.

"Sure. I believe you."

I waved a hand lazily toward the crowd, letting my gaze linger on Seraphina's face—a furious scarlet that somehow made her look even more vividly alive.

"Let's go. Quota... I mean, Mom and Dad are pressuring us to come home for dinner."

As I turned, Brandon’s hand shot out and clamped around my wrist.

"Leo Sinclair, wait."

His expression was severe, his voice deliberately low.

"You need to apologize to Sera for what you just said. You completely disrespected her and our friendship."

I looked down at his hand gripping my wrist, a slight frown creasing my brow.

"Let go."

"Not until you apologize!"

Brandon tightened his grip, playing the gallant protector.

I sighed, slowly reaching into my other pocket for my phone.

"Hello? 911? I'd like to report a sexual assault."

I put the phone to my ear, speaking clearly.

"Yes, an unknown male is forcibly restraining me and preventing me from leaving. The address is..."

Brandon dropped my arm as if scalded, his face a picture of disbelief.

"Are you insane?"

I lowered the phone, which hadn't even started ringing, and glanced at him, then at the rest of the silent room.

"My wife has a cut, and Brandon here suggested using his mouth to 'cure' it. Isn't that sexual assault?"

I paused, letting the silence draw out.

"I respect that you didn't escalate it, but consider this—"

I swept my gaze over every person there. "Every single one of you in this room is an accessory to marital sabotage."

Seraphina finally lost it, rushing forward.

"Leo Sinclair! Do you have to humiliate people like this?"

"Right, I forgot. You, the cold and selfish one, wouldn't understand the meaning of friendship!"

It was truly hilarious. Getting called out for crossing a line and immediately throwing a tantrum?

I thought I'd married a compliant, pretty face. Turns out she was a wild rose determined to climb over the fence. I, Leo Sinclair, might be a little Zen, a little lazy, but I’m not a doormat.

I let out a low laugh, scanned the room again, grabbed the girlfriend from Finn Davis’s arms, and shoved her straight into Brandon’s embrace.

"Go on, Brandon. You two are friends, right? Kiss her!"

Brandon instinctively caught the girl, completely bewildered, and looked helplessly at Seraphina.

Finn immediately leaped up, trying to snatch his girlfriend back. I blocked him. He yelled at Brandon.

"Get your hands off her, Cole! Let go of her now!"

Only after Finn had his girlfriend back and was soothing her did an excruciating silence fill the room.

Finn stood there, his fists clenched. He understood: I was forcing him to back down. He ignored Seraphina's frantic signals, picked up a bottle of liquor, and downed three rapid shots. He took a deep breath, his voice strained.

"My apologies, Leo. I didn't think a stupid game would cause such a misunderstanding. We were just trying to protect Sera."

"This has nothing to do with anyone else here; friends mess around, it happens. I’ll take three more shots. Let’s just move past this, okay?"

Before I could even speak, I felt the combined glare of everyone in the room, a collective look of disgust directed squarely at me.

Seraphina was shaking with rage. She violently slapped away my hand, which I had offered to lead her out. Her voice was sharp, cutting through the thick air.

"Brandon is severely allergic to alcohol! He could die, do you hear me?"

She demanded, the tears in her eyes not of sorrow, but of pure, furious humiliation.

She rushed to Brandon's side, checking him anxiously.

"Brandon, are you okay? We need to go to the emergency room right now."

Red hives were already breaking out on Brandon's neck, but he shook his head, refusing.

He looked up at me, the picture of an injured victim.

"Leo, you don't have to forgive me, but don't blame anyone else... and especially not Sera."

"I'll keep my distance from Sera from now on."

He made a move to push Seraphina away.

I let out a soft, mocking laugh.

"Promises are cheap, but men of their word are few and far between. You better keep that one."

"Enough!"

Seraphina cut me off sharply.

"Are you done with your petty games? I need to get him to the hospital. Is that acceptable, or do you have a problem with that too?"

She stared at me, defiant.

"I married into your family for a business merger, but I wasn't sold into slavery! I have my freedom!"

Watching them lean on each other and walk out, I honestly felt like the star of a low-budget, highly humiliating circus. What the hell was this? Did my parents secretly tell me to break up a pair of lovers?

I sullenly rubbed my nose and went home, only to be greeted by the sight of my father's thick, expensive leather belt.

"Where is she? You useless boy!" my father roared.

My brother, Reid, stood nearby, practically savoring my misfortune.

I jumped onto the couch, frantically protesting my innocence.

"Dad! That's domestic violence! I'm going to hit up TikTok and expose this toxic family structure!"

"Ouch—"

When he decided I’d been hit enough, Reid shoved his phone into my face.

"The story on the circuit is you bullied your wife's friend into alcohol poisoning, and he had to get his stomach pumped. Our family isn't a bunch of thugs, Leo. Look at the mess you've made!"

My head was spinning.

"I thought the Beaumonts were your business partners! I'm just an idle guy, I wouldn't dare actually get angry!"

"This is pure slander!"

At this point, I understood exactly what had happened. They were crying foul before the fact.

I pulled down my trousers to check the angry red marks on my backside, two lines of genuine tears streaming down my face. My father showed no mercy.

"Tomorrow, you will go out and salvage your image with your in-laws. Don't cause any more trouble!"

Waking up alone on the second day of my marriage, my first order of business was to pick up my new wife from the hospital.

I stood by the bedside, watching Seraphina sleep with her hand pressed against Brandon's.

I rested my chin on my hand, pondered for a moment, then took a discreet camera from my pocket and fixed it atop the cable box.

Seraphina stirred and woke up. The sight of me immediately made her face fall.

She pulled my arm, dragging me toward the door, and the moment we were outside, she angrily yanked her arm free.

"What are you doing here? Haven't you hurt Brandon enough already?"

My ancestors said, 'Don't argue with a fool.'

I took a deep breath, remaining perfectly calm.

"It's the official post-nuptial family gathering today. You didn't forget, did you?"

She shrugged, unfazed, even finding my presence unnecessary.

"It’s just a formality, Leo, a social charade. We're pawns in a merger, nothing more." Seraphina gave a bored tug on the corner of her mouth. "It doesn't matter if I'm there or not."

I gave an exasperated sigh. Smart, but not smart enough—at least, not as smart as me.

"The freedom you have now? Your parents bought it for you on that social charade. You're a pawn, but a very expensive one."

I spread my hands, not forcing the issue.

"Different stages of life require different trade-offs. If you think you can openly defy your parents now, I won't stop you."

"Think carefully, Wife."

With that, I turned to walk away. I silently counted to three. One... Two...

"Wait! I'm coming with you!"

...

I still overestimated her. Before the event was over, a phone call from Brandon was all it took for her to ditch me.

"Cover for me. Brandon says he's feeling emotionally vulnerable."

She looked at me, completely serious.

"You're the one who caused the harm, Leo. Someone has to make amends."

The female protagonist of the post-nuptial event had run off halfway.

Mr. and Mrs. Beaumont immediately fixed me with a condemning stare.

"Leo, Seraphina married you to be the Lady of the Sinclair family, not your prisoner."

"She has always been perfectly sensible. You terrorized her friend into the ER and then washed your hands of it. She is now cleaning up your mess."

"Frankly, Leo, your behavior—the public humiliation, calling the police, the ER visit over a joke... How can we possibly entrust our daughter to you?"

The Beaumonts spoke with an air of immense difficulty, as if pushed to their limit.

"We heard you inherited twenty percent of Sinclair Corp's shares."

"We believe you should transfer ten percent of those shares into Seraphina's name."

"With a tangible, real connection, perhaps you'll be more inclined to consider her feelings and act with more maturity."

The old foxes had spun the narrative and shifted all the blame onto me in a few sentences. And now they wanted a tangible asset as a reward. They wanted to have their cake and eat mine, too.

I quietly activated my phone and pulled up the live feed from the camera I'd installed.

Seraphina had reached the hospital room. She was naturally removing her formal dress, leaning in close to Brandon.

I smiled blandly at Mr. and Mrs. Beaumont.

"Father-in-law, Mother-in-law, it's not that I don't want to give it to you. I essentially got these shares for free just by being the 'Second Young Master.'"

"But I have to say, your daughter might not be as 'sensible' as you think."

On the screen, Brandon was tearfully wrapping his arms around Seraphina.

"Sera, I always felt like you had to fight for what you loved. But maybe I fought too slow. Now it's too late."

Tears welled up in Seraphina's eyes, too.

Brandon paused, then looked at her with a pleading gaze.

"Sera, I don't ask for much. But would you... would you tattoo my name? On your... on your..."

His hand moved subtly down toward her lower abdomen. Seraphina's face instantly flushed crimson.

The Beaumonts, their faces thunderous, slapped the phone out of my hand.

"That's disgusting! Utterly indecent!"

I didn't argue, slowly picking up my phone.

"Father-in-law, Mother-in-law, about those shares... shouldn't you be giving me some?"

Seraphina was confined to the Beaumont residence, supposedly to be 're-educated' before her return.

The Cole family, to save face, brought Brandon over to apologize. But the apology was hollow, and Brandon’s face was a mask of sulky defiance.

"Leo, my friendship with Sera is genuine! I swear there's never been anything inappropriate!"

I leaned in close, whispering with malicious softness.

"So genuine that it requires your name tattooed on a private part of her body to prove it?"

Brandon's face went instantly white as a sheet.

If I hadn't been concerned about my own family's reputation, I would have broadcast that revelation to the entire city.

This time, Brandon's apology was genuine.

He couldn't maintain his composure any longer and practically fled in terror.

When the 're-educated' Seraphina returned, she was noticeably quieter.

In fact, one month later, she gently laid her hand on her stomach and announced to me:

"I'm pregnant!"

These four words detonated a bomb in the Sinclair household.

My brother, Reid, is a staunch DINK (Double Income, No Kids) and a confirmed bachelor, so the burden of procreation had fallen entirely on me.

My parents instantly treated Seraphina like royalty.

I had to admit, she was efficient. One time and done.

My father saw the cynical smirk on my face and smacked me on the head.

"Go find something to do, Leo. Stop hanging around here being a bad omen!"

I shrugged, pouting. It was a performance, and the stage had been set. All I had to do was wait for the curtain call.

The opportunity arrived quickly.

Sinclair Corp was hosting an important business gala that required spousal attendance.

Seraphina claimed her growing bump felt a bit uncomfortable and insisted I stay with her for a while before we left.

Before we set off, I was sprawled on the couch playing a game. Seraphina handed me a glass of milk.

"Leo, you've been playing for so long. Tired? Have some milk so you'll have energy for the party."

I gave her a lazy smile, tipped my head back, and downed the milk in a few large gulps.

Seraphina took the empty glass, murmuring softly.

"Okay, rest for a minute, then we can leave."

She practically fled the living room.

The drug's effect was faster and more potent than I expected.

I slumped into the sofa, closing my eyes, letting the heavy, dragging sensation wash over me.

I registered people approaching, lifting me, and stuffing me into a car.

Bumps, darkness, and shards of muffled conversation drifted into my awareness.

"Don't worry, it's all arranged. Veronica loves the lean, clean type."

"He won't remember, will he?"

"The dose is guaranteed. When Veronica is done having her fun, he'll wake up convinced it was a blackout and a massive mistake..."

Veronica?

The infamous politician's daughter—the one rumored to have a powerful background, questionable kinks, and a history of destroying the lives of several young men?

Ha. They found me a perfect destination.

It was a brilliantly cruel plan. If I were permanently incapacitated, or worse, if I lost the ability to father a child, the one in her belly would be the sole heir.

Too bad. Brandon and Seraphina had underestimated the depth of my family's emotional intelligence.

They were thoroughly wicked, but not nearly clever enough.

The car suddenly came to a stop.

...

The gala had stalled. Sinclair Corp's partners were exchanging puzzled looks.

My brother, Reid, coolly took the stage to manage the situation.

"Ladies and gentlemen, my brother, Leo, informed me he had a special gift prepared for his in-laws."

"Please bear with us for a moment."

My father scowled, ready to storm off and find me.

"That good-for-nothing son! What trick is he playing now?"

"Reid, too! He spoils him rotten!"

My mother gently held him back, smiling ruefully.

"It's no use fighting it. And honestly, I'd prefer he never grow up."

Mr. and Mrs. Beaumont were sweating profusely, exchanging nervous glances with Seraphina. Seraphina gave them a shaky, reassuring smile.

The next second, a bloodcurdling shriek pierced through the ballroom's top-of-the-line sound system.

Seraphina's face instantly went paper white.
