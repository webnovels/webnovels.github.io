Everyone knew how much Julian Sterling loved me.

He started a film and television company just for me and proposed to me live on a global awards show.

But then, my mother was diagnosed with late-stage kidney disease. Julian found a donor named Briar, but on the day of the surgery, she was "in a car accident."

I watched him carry a seemingly injured Briar, whose forehead only had a small scrape, out of the hospital. "She's scared. Let's reschedule the surgery."

My mother flatlined on the operating table. At that very moment, Julian was in bed with Briar at her place.

I signed the divorce papers and left for Finland.

Yet, there he was, covered in snow, standing outside my door. "I gave her back her kidney. Please, come home."

I turned toward the kitchen. "Leo, could you take out the trash by the door?"


Scarlett POV

Everyone knew how much Julian Sterling loved me.

As CEO of the Sterling Group, when I said I wanted to be an actress, he poured a fortune into building a film and television company just for me. He poached the industry's top talent at premium rates and soon became celebrated in elite circles as the ultimate devoted husband.

Later, I achieved my dream, winning the coveted Actress of the Year award.

At the globally televised awards ceremony, he got down on one knee in front of all the cameras, pulling out a custom-made diamond ring, and proposed to me with heartfelt devotion.

From then on, I gradually stepped back from the spotlight and settled into my role as his full-time wife.

For three years after our marriage, our relationship was seen by the outside world as the perfect example of enduring love.

Until one day, my adoptive mother, Martha, was suddenly diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease in both kidneys. Her life depended on a kidney transplant.

Julian offered a hefty reward and found us a highly compatible kidney donor-Briar.

But on the day of the surgery, she was nowhere to be found.

I was practically frantic, dialing her number dozens of times before the call finally went through.

"Briar! Where are you?" My voice trembled beyond my control. "We agreed on the surgery for today! Why are you-"

Her voice on the other end was weak and shaky. "I'm so sorry, Ms. Scarlett, I... I got into a car accident on my way over..."

I froze.

"A car accident?"

She sniffled softly. "I'm hurt, so I might not be able to donate my kidney. Can the surgery be rescheduled?"

Before I could even answer, a deep male voice, one I knew all too well, suddenly came from her phone.

"Okay, stop crying. Reschedule it is. I'll take you home to rest first."

It was Julian.

The call was abruptly disconnected.

Listening to the dial tone, I stood rooted to the spot. Like a bucket of ice water had been dumped over my head, my mind went completely blank.

The doctor beside me asked anxiously, "Ms. Scarlett, how much longer until the donor arrives? Your mother has already been moved into the operating room; her condition is critical, we really can't delay any longer."

I snapped back to reality, my face pale. "Please wait, I'll go get her right now."

I practically stumbled out of the corridor.

Soon, on the other side of the hospital, I saw Julian.

He was carrying Briar, emerging from the emergency trauma department.

The man who usually only held me, was now, in a public place, holding another woman in his arms.

Briar had a bandage on her forehead and was leaning against his chest, her voice soft. "Mr. Sterling, aren't you getting tired holding me? Maybe you should put me down, I can walk."

"Aren't you dizzy? The doctor said you have a slight concussion. It's safer if I carry you."

He looked down at her, his tone gentle in a way I'd never heard before.

I stood not far away, completely frozen. My chest felt like it had been pierced sharply.

And the "car accident" she'd claimed? It had only left a slight scrape on her forehead.

Other than that, she had no obvious injuries.

Then, I heard her speak hesitantly. "But... I promised Ms. Scarlett I'd donate my kidney today. Now I can't go through with the surgery, I'm worried she might get angry..."

Julian's tone was calm. "You had an accident, it's unavoidable. If the surgery is delayed a bit, she won't blame you."

She looked up at him, her eyes slightly red, her hands resting on his shoulders. "Mr. Sterling, I'm actually really scared of the surgery. Just thinking about having a kidney removed from my body, I just..."

Julian paused, then said, "If you're truly scared and don't want to donate, I'll find another suitable kidney donor for her mother as quickly as possible during this time."

"Really?"

"Of course."

Just as I saw him carrying Briar towards the elevator, I finally snapped out of my shock.

I rushed over, my voice out of control as I shouted:

"Julian! The doctor said Mom can't wait any longer! Briar has to go in for the kidney transplant right now, immediately!"
