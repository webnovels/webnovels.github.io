Those three were his childhood friends who had grown up with him.

One was Peter Collins, who had taken over his family's company right after graduation and was very successful.

One was James Scott, who came from an artistic family and was a famous painter himself.

The last one was Samuel Moore, who came from a politically connected family and was now a prominent lawyer.

"Zachary, is this the girlfriend you dated for three years in college?"

"She looks like she's from a modest background. Are you sure she's not just after your money?"

The one speaking was Peter.

Zachary was stunned for a while before responding.

"Peter, that's not something to joke about."

"You know my parents only gave me $100 a month in college. How could she possibly be after my money?"

But then James quietly said:

"Zachary, didn't you appear in the newspapers a few times before?"

"What if she knew about your background in advance and pursued you on purpose?"

"James, how can you go along with Peter's nonsense?"

"Zoe's not that kind of person."

James smiled and didn't say anything more.

"Zachary, you have to be careful."

"You know that for families like ours, what we fear most are disputes over assets."

"If you end up divorcing after two years because you're not compatible, she'd be entitled to half your assets."

"I suggest you be cautious and have a prenup drawn up, control her finances and such."

"You know my dad made that mistake years ago and lost tens of millions..."

Samuel, true to his lawyer nature, couldn't stop talking about calculations and precautions.

I didn't listen any further.

After all, as Zachary's friends, I could understand them reminding him to be cautious.

But I believed Zachary knew what kind of person I was.

However, the next day, Zachary handed me a prenuptial agreement.
