Zachary and I were college sweethearts.

We dated for three years in college.

When I first met Zachary, he was working part-time at the library.

He always seemed to be short on money when we were dating.

It wasn't until after graduation when we started talking about marriage that I found out Zachary came from a wealthy family.

The first time I met his parents, I was very nervous.

Because I knew rich families usually had high standards for their daughters-in-law.

At least not someone from a modest background like me.

But to my surprise, Zachary's parents were very pleased with me.

Because when Zachary was in college, they had only given him a very small allowance each month to teach him independence.

They never expected that even with such limited means, there would be a girl willing to date Zachary.

They felt I wasn't after Zachary for his money, which made them very happy.

Dating for three years, not only did I end up marrying my boyfriend, but I also found out he came from a wealthy family.

And his parents approved of me too.

At the time, I felt like all the good fortune in the world had fallen into my lap.

Until right before the wedding, when I accidentally overheard a conversation between Zachary and his friends.
