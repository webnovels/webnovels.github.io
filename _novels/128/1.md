I had just gotten back from shopping.

As soon as I walked in, I saw Zachary sitting on the couch.

He looked up and asked, "Where did you go?"

I waved the shopping bags in my hand.

"I went shopping and bought some things."

He frowned.

"Why are you shopping again? The housekeeper said you just bought a bunch of stuff yesterday."

"I'm starting to think Peter and the others were right, you really are materialistic and just after money..."

His words suddenly trailed off as his gaze fell on the Gucci bag I was holding.

This was a luxury brand where even a single item cost thousands of dollars.

"Zoe Sullivan, you actually bought Gucci? Where did you get the money to buy Gucci?"

I put on an innocent face, "Honey, from the allowance you give me every month."

He got angry.

"Do I not know how much I give you each month?"

"$100 a month, what can you even do with that?"

I looked at him:

"Honey, didn't you say before that $100 a month was enough?"

"If you think $100 a month is too little, why did you just say I was materialistic and only after money?"

Zachary was at a loss for words as he realized how contradictory his two statements were.

Suddenly, his phone rang.

Zachary glanced at me before hurriedly answering the call and walking out.

I went back to our room.

Zachary's good friend Peter had sent me a message.

[Zoe, did you like the things you bought today?]

[Do you need more money?]

I hadn't had a chance to reply before Peter retracted the message asking [Do you need more money?]

The next second, I got a notification that $200,000 had been deposited into my bank account.

Well, a real man never asks a woman if she has enough money.

In this regard, Zachary's good friends were much better than him.
