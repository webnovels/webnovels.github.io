After we got married.

Zachary used the excuse that my health wasn't good to make me quit my job.

As luck would have it, the company I worked for was struggling financially at the time, on the verge of bankruptcy, and had been behind on our salaries for several months.

After getting my back pay, I voluntarily resigned, planning to take a break before looking for a new job.

But I never imagined.

After I quit, I was never able to go back to work.

First, Zachary was strongly against it, believing that being a full-time housewife was a good choice for me.

I couldn't believe Zachary would have such an idea.

"Zachary, you know."

"I never wanted to be a full-time housewife, I want to have my own career."

But Zachary said.

"Even if you have your own career, isn't the end result just to make money?"

"The Xavier family is already wealthy enough."

I was speechless and decided to go out and look for a job directly.

But I sent out hundreds of resumes.

Not a single company responded.

"Zoe, don't waste your energy, you won't be able to find a job in this city."

Looking at Zachary's confident expression, I seemed to know the answer.
