I looked at the agreement, my eyes full of disbelief.

"Zachary, what does this mean?"

"You don't trust me?"

Zachary probably didn't realize I had already overheard their conversation, so he casually made up an excuse.

"Zoe, it's not that I don't trust you."

"This is just a formality in our family, a prenup is necessary."

I countered.

"If you trust me, why is a prenup necessary?"

"Zachary, we've been together for three years, not three months, and certainly not three days."

"After three years, you still don't trust me? If that's the case, we might as well not get married."

With that, I angrily threw the agreement on the table and ran out.

That night, Zachary found me and sincerely apologized, admitting he had been foolish.

He promised not to bring up the prenup again.

And I softened and forgave him.

I thought this was just a small hiccup before the wedding, but I didn't realize it was only the beginning.
