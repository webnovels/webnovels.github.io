Dinner time arrived. Mrs. Stone, from the next bed, fed her husband while turning to ask me, "Little girl, who is this Dr. Ryan you keep talking about? Is he someone very important to you?"

He... he's my husband.

What kind of surgery takes eight hours? And he can't even spare a moment to see his wife after she wakes up?

I shook my head. "Just an acquaintance."

"Oh, I see."

"What about your family?"

Only one caregiver was looking after me. During my coma, she was the one who bathed me, changed my catheter... she did everything. I doubt anyone in the entire hospital was worse off than me.

I concocted a reason. "They're all in another city, and it's hard for them to travel."

My parents divorced when I was in middle school because my dad cheated. I was put in my dad's custody. My mom was devastated and moved overseas.

 My dad is a businessman, constantly flying between cities. Other than making sure my allowance card was loaded, he never had time to care for me. 

Oh, right, three years ago, he had a little brother with his new wife.
