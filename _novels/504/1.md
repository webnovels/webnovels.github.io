"Nurse, what's going on with the patient in the next bed? No one's come to see her."

"Hmph, maybe she did too many rotten things. Everyone's probably staying away from her."

Even while I was in a coma, I could hear conversations from outside. But in that dark world of unconsciousness, I struggled with every fiber of my being to wake up, yet I couldn't.

Finally, after countless attempts, a cup from the next bed clattered to the floor, the sound jolting me awake.

"Oh my, dear, you're awake!" Mrs. Stone gasped.

I stared at the ceiling, unable to move a muscle.

"Honey, I'm so sorry, did I scare you awake by dropping the cup?"

No, I should have thanked her for dropping the cup. It was the shock that finally allowed me to open my eyes. No one knew how terrified, how utterly helpless I felt in that dark, comatose world.
