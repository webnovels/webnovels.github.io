Word of my awakening quickly reached the doctors. They came to examine me, saying it was a good sign that I'd finally woken up. But among all the doctors in their white coats, I didn't see Liam.

I hadn't heard his voice while I was comatose. And he hadn't shown up since I woke.

"Where's Liam?"

A few doctors exchanged glances.

"Dr. Ryan… he's in surgery right now. He can't come over."

"Oh."

"How's my body doing?"

"When the accident happened, you landed on the back of your head, resulting in significant bruising in your brain, which was the cause of your coma. 

You also suffered a fractured right hand, a severe fracture in your left thigh, and several other fractures and soft tissue contusions.

 In short, your injuries were very serious. As of yesterday, you had been unconscious for forty days. Thankfully, you were brought to the hospital quickly. 

The blood clots in your brain are slowly reabsorbing, and your fractures have been surgically repaired and casted. They're healing well."
