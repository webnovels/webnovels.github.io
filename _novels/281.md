After the divorce, I left the old city. One night, an unknown number rang.

"Hello, who is this?"

Hearing my voice, the person on the other end seemed to sob, but quickly responded.

"Tomorrow is our son's death anniversary. I want to see him…"

That familiar tone. I knew it was my ex-husband.

"You're mistaken. Our son's anniversary passed ages ago. Don't contact me again."

I heard his choked voice through the phone. In the past, my heart would have ached, and I’d have rushed to comfort him.

Now, I hung up without hesitation, blocking his number to stop him from bothering me.

He had locked our son in a closet just because Leo, while playing with a toy plane, accidentally snagged his assistant's stockings.

And to appease his assistant, he’d sent everyone home, then jetted off with her on a vacation.
