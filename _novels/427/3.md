I laughed but said nothing, just watched him leave. Then I turned to look at Eric's office.

The bastard was clearly trying to provoke me. I was about to storm into his office when HR stopped me.

"Hold on, Mr. Cui is in a video call. You can't go in."

I glared at him. "I just beat up Mike and got away with it. What do you think will happen if I punch you? Will Eric fire me or you?"

The HR guy froze, not daring to stop me. I was about to go in when Eric came out.

Seeing me at the door, he frowned. "What do you want?"

"Mr. Cui, you seem to have forgotten. Didn't you say you'd give me an explanation?"

"Or would you rather discuss this here?"

Eric thought for a moment. "Let's talk outside. Follow me."

He gestured for me to come along. I followed him, watching his furrowed brow.

In the parking garage, Eric handed me an envelope. I felt it - about $1000.

"What's this supposed to mean?"

"Jack, take the money and you can keep working here normally. Don't make a fuss about this."

"Keep working normally? You slept with my wife and you want me to act like nothing happened?!"

I grabbed his collar. "Tell me the truth. When did it start?!"

Eric's face darkened. "I don't need to give you details. Besides this, there's also a bank card with $3 million. That's $1 million for each year - not a bad deal."

"You have 3 days, Jack. This is my final offer. For each day you delay, I'll deduct $1 million!"

I was about to say more but he cut me off. "Think it through before you speak to me again."

"After all, I call the shots at the company now. If you don't agree, once word gets out, I can crush you easily!"

He was threatening me!

I scoffed and slapped him hard across the face!

I dragged him out of the car and started beating him!

Eric was 7-8 years older and half a head taller, but he was all talk. He was no match for me at all!

Soon I had him pinned on the hood.

He yelled furiously: "Jack, you dare hit me?! I'll fucking kill you!"

I kneed him hard. His face went white with pain.

I grabbed his throat and roared: "Eric, you bastard! How dare you touch my wife!"

Suddenly a strong force knocked me over. Security had arrived and pinned me to the ground.

Eric got up, livid. "Call the police! Call the police!"

"Don't call the police!"

It was Amber. She came through the emergency exit.

I realized she'd been there the whole time!

"Let him go. I need to talk to him."

Eric waved the guards off and got in his car.

The guards released me but stood nearby, ready to jump in.

I glared at her with bloodshot eyes. "You told me you were forced into it. Just say the word and I'll help you get justice!"

Amber sighed impatiently. "Don't be stupid! Jack, let's end this peacefully!"

I stared at her, suddenly filled with rage. "Amber, we've only been married 4 years! You've been cheating for 3!"

"How could you do this to me?!"

But Amber was eerily calm. "Should I call you naive or just plain dumb? When has a newbie like me ever gotten an overseas assignment?"

The company had a policy of only sending men on foreign projects. I was shocked when Amber was chosen.

But she said she was talented enough to be the exception.

Even with the policy, they'd make an exception for her.

Now she was using this to mock my naivety.

She glanced at her phone. It showed a family photo of the three of them. How ironic!

"Jack, you can't give me what I want. Let's get divorced!"
