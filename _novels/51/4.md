I went out and ate to my heart's content. When I got back home, Mom and Dad were sitting in the living room waiting for me.

"Come here, I have something to say to you," Dad said.

I could probably guess what they wanted to talk about.

Since I came back, the two of them had barely spoken to me. The few times they did, it was always about wanting me to go on blind dates for an arranged marriage.

Money always circulates among a small group of people, and it's common for wealthy families to form connections through marriage.

They just didn't want Bella to do these things. Besides, Noah and Bella had grown close over time and showed signs of mutual affection. My parents were unwilling to disrupt that, so they had put off the idea.

However, my return solved this problem.

The unfavored second daughter was the perfect tool.

"Aria, the youngest son of the Cloud family has returned from abroad. You two are about the same age. Why don't you meet up sometime, have dinner and chat?"

Mom added, "After what happened to you, your father and I were so worried. We thought if you had a man by your side to protect you, we'd feel much more at ease."

I had always refused these kinds of arrangements. These rich kids grew up living decadent lifestyles and were involved in all sorts of unsavory business.

Mom and Dad clearly didn't care about my wellbeing at all, which had upset me for a long time.

But now it didn't matter. If meeting once could shut them up, that would be best.

I nodded. "Okay, when should we meet?"

They seemed surprised that I agreed so readily. The long lecture they had prepared had nowhere to go. Both of them paused awkwardly before Dad recovered first.

"Tomorrow at noon, at the restaurant owned by Cloud Corporation. If he takes a liking to you that would be great, but it's fine if he doesn't. They're not just any ordinary wealthy family."

I nodded.

The atmosphere fell silent again.

"Is there anything else?" I asked.

"No... that's all," Mom said.

I got up to go upstairs, my movements quick and decisive.

Mom and Dad exchanged a glance, both seeing complex emotions in each other's eyes.

"This girl has been acting strange lately. I hope she's not planning anything," Dad said.

"I'll have the housekeeper keep an eye on her. We can't let her cause trouble for the family," Mom replied.

"If only she was half as sensible as Bella."

"How could she compare to the daughter we raised ourselves..."

I let out a soft laugh.

Right, only Bella was "our daughter" in their eyes.
