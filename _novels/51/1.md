When I returned home from the hospital, there was no one in the house.

Even the furniture had been moved out.

Unable to contact my family, I called the housekeeper and found out they had moved to a new place.

I went to the address she gave me. The whole family was already sitting at the dining table, ready to eat.

Seeing me return, everyone at the table looked a bit uncomfortable.

"Why didn't you tell me you were moving?" I asked.

"Well, your sister has been having nightmares lately about being kidnapped," Mom said casually, as if discussing the day's menu. "I figured the old house might have some bad energy, so we changed locations. Your sister has a delicate constitution. It's good you're back - sit down and join us for dinner."

The table was full of Bella's favorite dishes.

My face was covered in thick bandages and I walked with a limp, but no one seemed to care.

In the past, I would have been very upset by this.

But now I felt nothing.

My emotions were gone.

Seeing me sit down calmly, Bella suddenly leaned over.

"I've been so scared these past few days, I didn't even dare to go out. That's why I couldn't visit you in the hospital. Mom and Dad were worried I might get kidnapped too, so they had to stay home with me. You don't blame me, do you, Aria?"

Before I could respond, Dad jumped in: "It's not a big deal. You two are sisters - can't you understand each other?"

I didn't know how to react.

I was the one who had actually been kidnapped.

Bella let out a hearty laugh. "Hehe, I was just afraid Aria might overthink things!" She picked up a shrimp and put it in my bowl.

"Anyway, Aria has always been so independent and much braver than me. I really admire people with guts like that."

I silently put down my chopsticks.

I'm allergic to shrimp.

Not a single person at the table remembered.
