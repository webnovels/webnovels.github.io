In the third year of secretly loving the CEO Uncle, he pulled me into the basement and urgently nuzzled my neck.

"Cora, please help me..."

I breathed through the pain and nodded firmly.

Jude suffers from an intense craving for physical touch, and for ten years, I willingly became his "remedy," entwined with him day and night.

The day I was diagnosed with stomach cancer, Jude kissed me tenderly. "Uncle has a favor to ask."

"Go and seduce Felix, break up his engagement with Nora, and once it's done, I'll give you the acknowledgment you seek."

"Cora, you've been clinging to me for ten years just for this, haven't you?"

Nora was the love he could never have.

Later, as he desired, Felix held me in his arms.

Jude clutched my pant leg, pleading for my touch.

I pushed him away coldly. "Uncle, have you lost your mind?"

Jude nearly died that night.
