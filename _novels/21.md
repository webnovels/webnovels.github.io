In my previous life, when I was gravely ill and hospitalized, my wife cut off all contact and vanished for two years.
From the moment I fell sick until I passed away, it was my sister who took care of me.
But after my death, my absent wife returned to claim my inheritance.
In the end, she took away 90% of my estate and went on to live a happy life with her first love.
Meanwhile, my sister had to mortgage our family home to pay for my treatment and ended up homeless.
When I opened my eyes again, I found myself on the day I was diagnosed with my terminal illness.
In this life, I still couldn't change the fact that I would die.
But I was determined not to let my sister suffer the same fate as before, and I certainly wouldn't let my deceitful wife get a penny!
1.
When I opened my eyes, the woman beside me couldn't contain her tears of joy.
"Thank goodness, brother, you're finally awake!"
I was momentarily stunned. The scene before me was all too familiar, and I realized I had been given a second chance at life.
My sister, Josephine Parker, held my hand and reassured me, "Don't be afraid, brother. Even if I have to sell everything we own, I'll make sure you get treated! You won't die..."
Seeing my sister with her eyes red from crying, my heart ached.
In my previous life, my wife, Fiona Brooks, had severed all ties and disappeared without a trace after I became seriously ill.
But my sister, Josephine Parker, had mortgaged our only home to ensure I received treatment, ultimately losing everything and ending up homeless.
After my death, Fiona returned with a lawyer, and as my "legal wife," claimed nearly 90% of my estate.
She then used the money to live a lavish life with her first love, Ezra Bennett.
The hospital room door suddenly opened, pulling me out of my memories.
It was Fiona!
She walked into the room in high heels, clutching a medical report, her eyes slightly red as if she had just cried.
But I noticed a distinct pinch mark on her wrist—she had deliberately hurt herself to aid in her dramatic display of tears.
"Honey..." Fiona rushed to my bedside, holding my hand and crying, "Honey, the doctor said you... you have cancer! Boohoo..."
She cried convincingly, but the tears never really fell, like a performer failing their role.
I ignored her sobs and focused on her carefully applied makeup, reflecting on everything from my previous life. I sighed, realizing how deceptive appearances could be.
Who would have thought that such a pretty and gentle wife would leave me after I fell ill?
According to the previous life's events, we'd argue soon, and Fiona would leave, cutting off all contact until I died, only to return and fight for my inheritance.
As I pondered, I noticed a dark red mark peeking from her collar.
I reached out to reveal it, my face darkening, "What does the tattoo 'TH&WL' under your collarbone mean?"
Fiona was startled, quickly brushing my hand away and readjusting her top, "Are you hallucinating because you're so sick? There's no tattoo."
I sneered inside, playing dumb. "Must have been a hallucination, then."
She still carried the lingering scent of Ezra Bennett.
"What's that smell on you?" I asked, pretending not to know.
"What smell? Nolan Parker, you're sick now; I don't want to argue with you!" Fiona's face was displeased.
Josephine shot Fiona a disapproving look, "At a time like this, you still want to argue with my brother? Are you trying to make things worse for him?"
"Fiona, you should go back to work. I'll take care of Nolan."
My sister wanted to send Fiona away to avoid any arguments between us.
In my previous life, I had caused a huge scene at this point. In this life, I found it unnecessary.
So I didn't have a direct conflict with Fiona.
After Fiona left, I finally calmed down to consider my strategy.
I needed to transfer all my assets to my sister before I died.
2.
Three days after being discharged, I immediately contacted my classmate Gideon Carter, a highly skilled private lawyer who had handled many difficult cases.
"You're in the late stage of liver cancer? No way?"
Gideon was shocked to hear about my cancer diagnosis, but after seeing my diagnosis report, he sighed deeply, "I'm sorry, I didn't expect..."
I shook my head with a smile, "I called you today to draft a will. I want to transfer all my money to my sister."
After reviewing the documents I provided, Gideon shook his head, "That might be difficult. Fiona is your legal wife, and by law, she has rights to half of your assets."
I pushed a thick stack of envelopes toward Gideon, "Don't tell me about the process; I just want results. Also, here's a lead: Fiona's having an affair, and it's with our college classmate, Ezra Bennett."
"Ezra Bennett??"
Gideon was shocked, his mouth agape, "That guy seemed honest... who would've thought?"
"That's why I'm asking an old classmate to help me find evidence of Fiona's affair."
"Alright..."
After leaving the law firm, I returned home and was surprised to find Fiona there!
"You, why are you home?"
I was surprised.
Maybe because I didn't insist on exposing the tattoo under Fiona's collarbone, the butterfly effect led to her not cutting me off or leaving in this life.
Fiona was excited, "Honey, I asked a doctor friend. They said, while domestically they can only prolong life, there have been successful treatments abroad!"
I was taken aback, "Terminal liver cancer can be treated?"
"Yes, yes, yes! Of course, it can! But the surgery is very expensive..."
"How much?" I suddenly became interested.
Not because I naively believed the terminal illness could be cured, but because I wanted to know her real intentions.
Fiona told me, "The surgery costs about $50,000."
$50,000, which is roughly over 350,000 dollars.
Fiona really had a good plan! 350,000 is almost the total of all my assets!
She wanted to trick all my money out and then live a happy life with Ezra Bennett!
"Forget it. Losing everything for a treatment that might not work isn't worth it."
Bang!
Fiona slammed the chopsticks on the table, anxiously saying, "How can you say that? If there's a chance to be cured, even if it means losing everything, I'll do it!"
Ha!
If I hadn't lived through two lifetimes, I might have believed your nonsense!
"Alright then, you make the arrangements, I want to rest for a while."
Fiona suddenly realized, "Wait, honey, you're so sick, why aren't you in the hospital and back home?"
Her expression turned sour, as if she thought of something, and quickly came over to pull me, "No, you must go back to the hospital with me now! You need to be hospitalized!"
I thought, go to the hospital so you and Ezra can have your secret meetings?
But... it wouldn't be impossible.
"I'm just grabbing something, then I'll head back. The doctor prescribed medicine, and I'm not bedridden yet."
Just as I was about to leave, I heard the sound of the door code being entered, and then Ezra Bennett burst in.
"Sweetheart! I'm here! I missed you so much!"
3.
Ezra rushed in and hugged Fiona, completely unaware that I was in the corner.
Fiona was terrified, "Let go of me! Don't touch me!"
Ezra looked puzzled, "Sweetheart, what's wrong?"
The next second, he could no longer call her sweetheart because he saw me.
His face turned pale, "Nolan Parker? Weren't you in the hospital?"
"If I were in the hospital, I wouldn't have seen such a marvelous scene. Fiona, do you have an explanation for this?"
I was so angry I could curse!
Not because Fiona and Ezra hugged, but because of Ezra's stupidity! He didn't even check the room before hugging my wife!
Now I couldn't pretend not to know about their affair!
I didn't even have the chance to act dumb!
So I had to question him, "Ezra Bennett! We're classmates, right? You just walked in and hugged my wife, what's up with that? And how do you know my house code?"
Ezra was extremely embarrassed, scratching his head, "Well... I, actually I..."
He couldn't get a word out.
Fiona was quick to react, explaining to me, "Honey, don't misunderstand. Didn't I just tell you about the surgery abroad? Ezra was the one who helped introduce it. He must have some good news, so he got excited and forgot about the boundaries and hugged me!"
Fiona's explanation made Ezra quickly chime in, "Yes, yes, yes! That's exactly what happened! I was just too excited, and then I was startled to see you, so I got a bit flustered. Old classmate, you don't mind, right? I'm doing this for your good."
Ha...
Of course, I don't mind. Not only do I not mind, but I also hope you two get together quickly, so I have the chance to carry out my plan!
Thinking this, I couldn't say it out loud:
"But you can't do that, right? Hugging my wife in front of me? Don't you know you shouldn't mess with a friend's wife?"
Fortunately, Ezra knew about Fiona's inheritance transfer plan, so he sat beside me, "Buddy, I'm sorry about your condition, but there's still hope! The doctor I know abroad is really good in the field of liver surgery!"
Heh...
Of course, I don't mind. In fact, I hope you two get together soon so I can finally put my plan into action!
That's what I thought, but I couldn't say it out loud:
"Isn't this a bit much? Hugging my wife right in front of me? Haven't you heard you shouldn't mess with a friend's wife?"
Luckily, Ezra Bennett knew about Fiona Brooks' plan to transfer her inheritance. He came over and sat next to me. "Hey buddy, I'm really sorry about your illness, but there's still hope! I know a doctor overseas who's excellent with liver surgeries!"
"Sure, the surgery is expensive, but you only live once. Once you save your life, you can earn back the money!"
Seeing Ezra act so concerned made me inwardly seethe with anger.
Sell everything to scrape together money, send it abroad, and then let you and Fiona live it up?
"Just talk to Fiona about it. I trust her! I'm a bit tired and just grabbing some stuff before heading back to the hospital."
"You guys chat."
I got up and went into the room. The first thing I did was grab the property deed.
Then I stuffed it deep into my backpack, along with a few clothes to make it look casual.
"I'm off. You guys talk. It's best if you give me a plan soon. I'm young and don't want to die."
Standing at the door, I shook Ezra's hand, pretending as if I couldn't live without him.
Downstairs, into the car.
The first thing I did was turn on my phone's surveillance.
The house had cameras originally for watching our pet dog. I never thought I'd use them to keep an eye on my wife now.
On the couch, the two sat side by side. Ezra's hand was getting a bit too familiar, and Fiona slapped it away. "Don't mess around. This is still Nolan Parker's home. Don't go overboard!"
Ezra, rubbing his slapped hand, looked a bit upset. "How's that overboard? It's not like we haven't done things here before."
"Nolan's about to die soon. What are you afraid of? Once we transfer his money abroad, we'll be free to be together!"
"True. Let's find a place to hide for two years. I don't want to take care of him every day. We can come back to claim the inheritance once he's dead."
I'd love to see what she does when she finds out I'm not dead in two years.
Fiona Brooks has a strong sixth sense!
She actually gave up the plan to take all my assets and decided to take part first, then come back for the inheritance after squandering it and when I'm dead.
I tapped the steering wheel, trying hard to come up with a counter-plan.
Suddenly, a bright idea struck me—a very feasible plan.
In my past life, after being blocked by my wife, I let myself go and didn't cooperate with the hospital for chemotherapy, so I died within two years.
But this time, I'm going to defy her wishes and live as long as I can.
And not just live longer, but find a way to fake my death and trick her into coming back for the inheritance!
On the third day of my hospital stay, Fiona and Ezra came to see me.
"Honey, Ezra and I just discussed, and he's planning to take me abroad to see that expert doctor."
I frowned, acting like I didn't know: "You're going abroad?"
Fiona nodded, "Of course, I need to check if that doctor is really skilled. Only then can I trust him to perform surgery on you! Honey, I'm doing this for your own good!"
I've heard "for your own good" so many times, I'm sick of it.
"Alright, then you guys go."
Fiona hesitated and rubbed her thumb and forefinger together: "But honey, I need funds."
I pulled out an international card and handed it to her: "All the funds you need are on this card. There's definitely enough money for you. Go ahead, I'll be waiting at home for good news."
This international card was something I arranged through a lawyer friend, spending quite a bit to have a professional set it up. No matter how much is spent, I'll receive cross-border text messages on my phone.
"There's a million on the card, use it as you wish."
There's indeed a million on the card, but 900,000 of it is frozen and unusable.
Once she spends the ten thousand, and the rest can't be accessed, she'll naturally come back.
And what I need is her international spending notifications. Then, I'll hire a private investigator to capture evidence of her and Ezra's affair abroad.
Fiona couldn't hide her delight when she heard I prepared a million for her.
"That's great, honey~" She hugged me, leaving a kiss on my cheek with a crisp "mwah" sound. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Ezra's lips turn into an unhappy frown.
"Come on, you two are practically an old married couple, can you not show off your love in front of me?"
Ezra said, pulling Fiona out of my arms.
I frowned at Ezra, "What? My wife is going abroad, and I don't know when she'll be back. You even have an issue with me kissing her?"
Ezra was clearly upset, feeling like his own wife was being encroached upon. But he didn't dare to get angry, only managing to say coldly, "Once we contact the doctor and cure your illness, you two can get as cozy as you want. The flight will be missed soon, Fiona, we should leave early."
Fiona, after hearing this, reluctantly said goodbye to me, uttered a few polite words, and then left the ward with Ezra.
As soon as they left, I called the private investigator: "They've left, follow them, don't lose track."
"Don't worry, boss. You get what you pay for. Trust me, keep an eye on your phone for updates."
Shortly after Detective Wang hung up, I received real-time tracking short videos on Snapchat.
Watching the videos, I couldn't help but admire Detective Wang's skills.
In the video, although Detective Wang was filming from 20 meters away, Fiona and Ezra's conversation was clearly captured in the short video.
After asking, I learned that Detective Wang had purchased a directional listening device abroad, with a coverage range of nearly 300 meters!
I was genuinely impressed. You get what you pay for. Such professional listening devices aren't something an average private investigator can afford.
Or even if they could, they might not have the means to get them.
The first place Fiona and Ezra went after leaving the hospital was the nearest international bank.
Confirming there was indeed a million in the account, Ezra couldn't help but say happily: "Nolan Parker really gave you a million? He's so generous. If he knew you were taking this million not to find a doctor for him but to have fun abroad with me, I wonder how he'd react. I'm so looking forward to it."
Fiona couldn't help but give him a playful glare, "You're so bad!"
Though it seemed like a complaint, her tone was full of affection.
I felt deeply hurt. Fiona had never shown such playful affection towards me.
I always thought she wasn't someone who'd act coy, but it turned out I wasn't worthy of her tenderness.
While I was lost in thought, Fiona took out a watch from her bag, "Ezra, a man needs to have some style abroad. You should wear this watch."
Ezra's eyes nearly popped out when he saw the watch. "Patek Philippe? This thing starts at 300,000 at the lowest! Let me see this model... Holy crap? A platinum vintage model? This thing starts at a million!"
Fiona was stunned, "What? It's that expensive? This watch was left to Nolan by his father. I saw him take it out occasionally but never wear it, so I snuck it out."
Ezra extended his wrist, and Fiona affectionately helped him put it on, "It's just a million-dollar watch! To me, you're the most precious in the world! This watch suits you best!"
Listening to their unabashed display of affection made me feel utterly nauseated.
Especially that platinum watch, it deeply pierced my heart.
