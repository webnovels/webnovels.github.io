The company decided to downsize using what seemed like a fair method—an anonymous online vote.

Whoever got the most votes would be let go.

The boss gave us one day to cast our ballots.

The next day, when Mr. Reid announced the results, I was shocked.

The entire company had only 198 employees. All 197 votes went to me.

I stood up with a bitter smile, ready to process my termination.

But Mr. Reid stopped me. "Wait. Look at this first."

He opened the online voting system's records.

All 197 votes had been cast in the exact same second.

I understood immediately—this wasn't a fair vote at all!


Mr. Harrison Reid announced:

"The layoff is suspended for now. IT department, investigate this voting system first."

Then Harrison glanced at me.

"Clara, you stay."

Vivian Matthews, the project manager, was the last to leave.

As she passed by, she lightly patted my shoulder.

"Clara, don't worry. I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding."

I nodded.

When only Mr. Reid and I remained in the conference room, he placed a document in front of me.

"This is your performance record for the past six months."

I looked down. My rating was "Outstanding."

"Why do you think an employee with perfect performance reviews would be unanimously voted out by the entire company?"

Harrison's question hung in the air.

I stayed silent, my mind racing.

Vivian always presented my PowerPoint presentations during work reports as "our team's results."

Technical problems I'd solved after working until midnight were claimed as her achievements the next day.

Last quarter's most important project—she screwed it up, and I pulled three all-nighters to salvage it.

I thought if I just worked hard and treated people kindly, I'd eventually earn recognition.

Turns out, in their eyes, my tolerance just meant I could be pushed around.

"Mr. Reid, why are you helping me?"

I looked up at Harrison.

Harrison leaned back in his chair.

"I'm not helping you. I'm helping the company eliminate parasites. This company needs real talent."

I understood immediately.

"I'm giving you one week," Harrison said.

"Find the parasite."

"I'll need help."

I looked at him and stated my condition.

Harrison seemed to have expected this.

"IT will cooperate with you. Officially, starting now, you've been suspended and need to process your termination immediately."

"Alright."

I nodded.

When I walked out of Harrison's office, my coworkers' laughter stopped abruptly.

Vivian was the first to react. She walked over with her coffee mug.

"Clara, finished talking with the boss? How'd it go? Everything okay?"

I looked at her and smiled.

"It's fine."

"Mr. Reid asked me to resign. I'm leaving."

I clearly saw a flash of barely concealed triumph in her eyes.

"What? How could this happen..."

She covered her mouth dramatically, pretending to be dismayed.

"Well, don't be too upset. Think of it as a vacation. You can find work anywhere, right?"

The surrounding coworkers chimed in.

"Yeah, Clara, don't take it to heart."

"Vivian's right. A new job might be better for you anyway."

I looked at these people. They were like vultures circling.

"Thanks for your concern, everyone."

After speaking, I turned and went back to my desk.
