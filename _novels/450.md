Suddenly, after I got pregnant, Gabriel became incredibly attentive to me.

He canceled all his social engagements and personally cooked for me. Everyone envied me for finding such a devoted husband.

Until I accidentally discovered a document in his study - "Agreement for Directed Blood Donation During Pregnancy and Newborn Cord Blood Donation".

My name and ID number were clearly listed!

In the beneficiary column was Aria Song, the love of his life he had kept abroad for seven years...

From outside the door came his gentle, doting voice.

"Don't worry, Aria. I'm personally overseeing her. Nutrition, rest - everything is according to the highest standards. I guarantee the baby will be born healthy. Your life-saving treatment is absolutely assured!"

So all those carefully prepared prenatal meals, the mountains of supplements - none of it was out of love for me.

It was to raise me into a qualified "blood bank"!
