Chapter 1
When Ivy Jenkins returned home from preschool with our nanny, she was crying hysterically. 

"Do I not have a dad, Mommy?" she choked out between sobs. "Daddy said he'd attend the parent-teacher meeting with me. But when he arrived, he claimed he was Jenna's dad instead."

She wailed, "All the other kids are saying I don't have a dad, Mommy…"

My heart ached. Holding back tears, I pulled Ivy into my arms. 

I wanted to say something to comfort her. However, when I thought about how coldly Liam Jenkins had acted toward her, I found myself at a loss for words.

I couldn't help but regret what I'd done in the past.

After waiting for three whole years, I thought Liam had finally come to his senses and decided to return home to us. To my dismay, he had only come back to the country because of Amy Miller. 

When Amy, his ex-girlfriend, told him she no longer wanted to live abroad, he immediately bought flight tickets and made the necessary arrangements for them to return. On top of that, he even transferred Jenna Miller, Amy's daughter, to the best preschool in the city.

On the day we went to pick him up from the airport, Ivy wore the prettiest dress she owned.

"Do you think Daddy will like me, Mommy?" she asked nervously.

I nodded. "Of course he will, Ivy. You're his only daughter."

Brimming with excitement, we arrived at the airport—only to find Liam holding Amy's hand. To make matters worse, he was carrying a three-year-old girl in his arms.

Ivy and I instantly froze. 

Liam looked at me emotionlessly. "Sorry. I need to help Amy and Jenna settle into their new home. You two should head back for now."

He didn't spare Ivy a single glance, but he stared at Jenna with a tender expression. 

When I recalled that memory, I instinctively shut my eyes. I felt dejected.

"I'm sorry, Ivy. This is all my fault. I'll attend your next parent-teacher meeting, okay?"

I gently wiped the tears from Ivy's face before putting her to bed.

It took a while for her to fall asleep. 

"I want a hug, Daddy…" she mumbled, frowning as she cried in her sleep.

My heart ached. If it hadn't been for what happened three years ago, she probably wouldn't be in so much pain.

I had a crush on Liam for a decade. Feeling sorry for me, my dad, Benjamin Smith, spiked Liam's drink and sent him to my room. 

I was horrified. 

"What are you doing, Dad?" I exclaimed.

He sighed. "I've known about that little crush of yours for some time now. Liam's interested in you too. He just doesn't want to admit it."

He continued, "The other night, I even heard him calling your name after he got drunk. Instead of wasting time, you two should just seal the deal and get together."

I tried to object, but my body had already started growing hot.

My dad chuckled. "I put something in your drink too. Enjoy the rest of the night, Yvonne."
