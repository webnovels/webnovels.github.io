When I found out I was the billionaire’s illegitimate daughter, I raced over to meet my father, my heart pounding with excitement.

But when I arrived at Thorne Manor, I discovered 98 other illegitimate daughters already lined up, waiting for their chance to meet him too.

As it turned out, Mr. Thorne’s only son had passed away, and he was searching for an heir to his multi-billion-dollar empire.

He’d gathered all his illegitimate daughters, hoping to find the strongest successor through a series of challenges.

Feeling completely outmatched, I hung my head, ready to slip away quietly.

Suddenly, I heard my late mother Eleanor’s voice speaking to me:

“Scarlett, don’t go! I know how you can win this. Remember your arch-rival from the orphanage? Valerie? She’s one of them too! If you walk away now, that multi-billion-dollar fortune will all go to her!”

I spun around, and sure enough, there was Valerie’s face staring back at me.

Ten years ago, she’d locked me in that dusty, rat-infested storage room, stolen my shot at adoption, and condemned me to another decade of misery. The memory made anger burn in my chest.

Alright, Mom. I’m listening. I’m not leaving.

Mr. Thorne’s billions? They’re as good as mine!
