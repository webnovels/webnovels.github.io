"Stephen, the German engine subsidiary is facing bankruptcy. This was your hard work; can't you just…" Savage's voice wavered.
Back then, Stephen’s innovative car engine doubled the entire group's profits. When he was offered the position as president of the German subsidiary, his girlfriend, Diana, had pleaded with him not to leave, so he stayed in Washington.
"Alright, I'll go," Stephen replied calmly.
Savage, momentarily stunned, sounded excited. "You’ve thought it through? Wonderful! When you return, a promotion is certain! Don’t worry about a thing!"
"Alright. Thank you, Savage."
After hanging up, Stephen looked quietly at the flickering candles on the cake. It was already 11 p.m., and Diana was nowhere to be seen at his door.
Instead, she appeared in a post on her junior Wayne’s social media.
In the photo, Diana was tutoring Wayne. Their faces were so close that they were almost touching, and she wore a gentle, unguarded smile.
The image felt like a stab in Stephen’s eyes.
"Stephen, let’s get engaged on your 25th birthday."
"Alright."
Years ago, they had made that promise. And today was his 25th birthday.
They had met at five and were the quintessential childhood sweethearts.
At twenty, she confessed her feelings, tearfully promising to be with him forever.
At twenty-two, she decided to pursue her Ph.D., so he gave up further studies, going to work early just to earn more to support her education.
Yet, no matter what he did, it never seemed to be enough. It was never enough.
Now, Diana spent more time at research seminars and on her thesis, growing increasingly distant.
The last message he had from her was a lie she had sent that afternoon:
"Working on revisions tonight. I’ll be home late."
Stephen forced a bitter smile.
Diana wasn’t too busy. She just preferred to spend her time getting close to her junior.
Enough was enough.
Despite the heartache, Stephen still wanted to finish this birthday.
He lit the candle, the warm glow reflecting in his eyes, solidifying his decision.
Once, he had imagined countless futures with Diana, but now those dreams faded like smoke.
Watching the candle burn down, Stephen closed his eyes slowly.
"Twenty-five. Leave Diana. Leave her for good."
He blew out the candle.
…
Diana finally returned past midnight.
The night was deep. She opened the door to find Stephen sitting on the couch, silently smoking.
The table was spotless, and the candle on the cake had long been extinguished.
Diana frowned as she changed her shoes, speaking carelessly:
"Why are you smoking again? Put it out and open a window. How am I supposed to stay here with this smell?"
"Today’s your birthday. I was too busy, so let’s celebrate later, okay?"
Stephen’s face, half-shrouded in shadow, was calm, though his heart was far from it.
Exhaling a ring of smoke, he spoke in a low voice.
"What were you so busy with?"

Smoke curled around Stephen's face, his profile starkly clear in the dim light.
Diana felt a flicker of emotion but also sensed something unfamiliar about him.
A pang of guilt flashed through her as she avoided his direct gaze. "I was rushing to finish my SCI paper; my advisor kept me late. Didn’t you see my message?"
Stephen let out a soft laugh, extinguishing his cigarette with force. Though he’d expected this response, an indescribable bitterness still rose within him.
As he stubbed out the cigarette, Diana sat down on the sofa, quickly changing the subject. "I got you a gift. Open it up. If you don’t like it, you can exchange it."
She pulled a pristine gift box from her bag and busied herself lighting candles on the cake.
Just then, her phone, left on the coffee table, buzzed.
Stephen glanced at the screen and saw it was a message from Wayne, her junior.
“Did you get home safe, Diana?”
“Thanks so much for today! Next time, romantic dinner on me.”
The messages included a heart emoji and an overly affectionate tone.
Stephen’s chest tightened as he opened the gift box. Inside was a delicate watch, adorned with sapphire-blue stones.
He had told her more than once that he didn’t like blue.
And it was identical to the one Wayne had shown on his social media.
So, she’d bought one for Wayne and conveniently got an extra for him.
"Thanks," Stephen said nonchalantly, tossing the watch carelessly into the drawer on the coffee table.
In the past, he would have confronted her, demanded answers. But now, none of it mattered.
After repeated betrayals, he no longer felt compelled to try.
Diana didn’t notice the resolute look in his eyes or the calm, emotionless expression on his face. She just saw a faint, almost relieved smile.
He was ready to make his wish a reality.
To leave her. Completely.
The cake was barely cut when Diana’s phone rang. She quickly ran over, snatching it from the table.
"Stephen, my advisor just asked me to revise my paper again. Go ahead and eat the cake on your own."
Without hesitation, she dashed to the study and shut the door.
Bang!
Now that Wayne was in the picture, she didn’t even bother to keep up appearances.
She hadn’t even asked about his birthday wish.
Silence fell over the living room. Stephen quietly threw the cake into the trash and retreated to his bedroom for a peaceful sleep.
The next morning, the house was empty.
Stephen was eager to leave. He got up, packed his things, and prepared to go abroad.
He took down every photo, every little memento from the bedroom.
The painting Diana had given him when she confessed her love, he tossed it right into the trash. Then he walked to the study.
The desk was covered in books and papers.
He picked up a textbook on aerospace materials, and the name on it was Wayne's.
The subject was precisely his own specialty, miles away from Diana's field of semiconductors.
He recalled suggesting that she choose the same major as him, so he could help her with her career someday.
But she’d brushed it off, saying aerospace materials were too difficult and she didn’t want to start over.
Now, for another man, she was willing to study something entirely new.
The book was filled with dense notes, evidence of the time and effort she’d poured into learning.
It turned out his dedication was nothing but a joke in the face of this junior.
Stephen felt no strong emotions. He simply put the book back, as if nothing had happened.
Ding!
His phone pinged with a message from Wayne.
“Diana is helping me with my studies. Could you please bring her book to campus?”

"Oh, by the way, Diana specifically asked me to tell you that," Wayne's smug tone carried through the phone, and Stephen found it almost laughable.
Just two sentences from him made it clear how much Diana usually spoiled this so-called junior, giving him the confidence to act so arrogant.
But Stephen had already decided to leave, and he didn’t care about Diana’s affairs anymore.
"No need to bother. I never said I’d deliver it."
"Let her come get it herself. I’m busy."
With that, he ended the call and continued packing for his trip abroad.
In less than half an hour, Diana stormed through the door, a hint of anger on her face.
"Didn’t I say I needed to help Wayne with his studies? You couldn’t even deliver something for him, but you have time to pack?"
"If this messes up his future, how are you going to make it up to him?!"
Hearing that, Stephen didn’t even bother to question her.
He decided to think of everything he had done for her as wasted on someone who didn’t appreciate it.
Diana seemed to realize she’d crossed a line and quickly muttered a half-hearted apology before going to the study to grab the textbook.
But before leaving, she noticed something strange.
"Why are you packing? Are you going on a business trip?"
"Throwing everything away. I don’t want it anymore," Stephen replied, his face expressionless.
Diana seemed like she wanted to say something but ultimately left in a hurry, closing the door behind her.
After discarding the last photograph, Stephen booked his ticket to Europe.
He looked at the confirmation screen, taking a deep breath of relief.
Just one more week, and he could leave for good, disappearing from Diana’s life.
Two days passed. Stephen had nearly completed his work handover and was about to contact the aerospace base in Germany.
Diana hadn’t come home the previous night, claiming that Wayne’s paper was on a tight deadline and that she’d be staying at school all week. Stephen didn’t question it.
Knock, knock, knock!
A knock on the door broke the silence. Opening it, Stephen saw his friend Benjamin standing there.
Stephen had told him about his plans just yesterday, and now Benjamin had rushed over.
"You finally came to your senses, huh? I can’t believe everything you went through for her," Benjamin said loudly. "You gave up an opportunity because of Diana before, but you can’t miss this one."
Stephen exhaled deeply as he continued typing on his laptop. "I won’t change my mind this time."
"Good."
Benjamin offered him a cigarette, surprised when Stephen took it without hesitation.
This brand was the one Stephen had smoked since middle school. Every time they confided in each other, they’d light one up. But after Diana insisted he quit, he hadn’t touched one since.
Sensing something, Benjamin softened his tone.
"So… did you tell her about this?"
"No need."
Benjamin glanced at the bag full of souvenirs and photos, hesitating for a second before realizing what Stephen wasn’t saying.
He finally understood how much his friend had endured all these years.
"We’ve been best friends since grade school, and I’ve seen you and Diana go through everything together."
"To be honest, you’re a good guy. She doesn’t deserve you."
"On your last day, I’ll gather everyone for a farewell party."
"Alright."
Stephen stayed silent, just quietly blowing smoke.
He had grown up in poverty, his mother remarried, and his father passed away, so he’d always longed for a stable family.
Looking around the house, he could still remember when they’d first moved in, lying on the sofa with Diana and imagining their future together.
Noticing his friend’s sadness, Benjamin quickly changed the subject.
"Look at your packing! Europe’s freezing; you won’t survive with just this."
"Come on, let’s go buy some essentials."
They bought plenty of items along the way.
But while shopping for a winter coat, they unexpectedly ran into Diana.
She was holding hands with Wayne, carefully helping him choose a down jacket, zipping it up for him, looking every bit like a woman deeply in love.
