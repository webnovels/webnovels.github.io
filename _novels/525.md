On my twentieth birthday, the girlfriend I'd been with for three years pushed me from a high-rise building.

"Finally rid of you, you pathetic loser," she spat, her voice chillingly cold.

In that last moment, I watched as my so-called best friend wrapped an arm around her, both of them smirking down at me.

I had loved her for three years, and she tried to murder me. A crushing wave of despair washed over me, and I closed my eyes in resignation.

Then, I was reborn. I reclaimed the family keepsake that proved my identity, taking back what was rightfully mine as the heir to a wealthy fortune.

Now, she was on her knees, pleading, "Asher, please, save me. Please?"
