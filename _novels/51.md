After I was kidnapped, my whole family was relieved because the kidnappers had mistaken me for my sister Bella, who was supposed to be the target.

When the police rescued me, I was bleeding from almost every pore on my body. I didn't cry or make a fuss.

I developed emotional indifference syndrome.

I had no emotions and could no longer feel sad about anything happening around me.

I felt more at ease than I had on any previous day.

But later, they all regretted it and begged me to return to my former self.
