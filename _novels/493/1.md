When I arrived at the scene, my sister, her eyes frozen open in terror, lay silently in the coffin.

The coffin lid next to her was covered in countless scratch marks, swirling in patterns.

They screamed of how much pain and despair my sister had endured before she died.

It was as if her cries for help were right there, echoing.

"Sis, save me!"

"I'm sorry." All my strength drained, and I collapsed to my knees, my veins throbbing as my hands clawed at the dirt.

Sharp pebbles cut into my palms, and only that searing, agonizing pain kept me from losing all sanity.

Slowly, I pieced her broken body parts back together.

"You beasts! The Blackwood family has gone too far!"

My parents, who arrived shortly after, roared in heart-wrenching anguish at the sight.

My mother even had a heart attack and passed out on the spot.

She couldn't even attend the funeral.

In the mourning hall,

My dad kept whispering to my sister.

"Don't trust men so easily over there, especially those who talk big but do nothing."

"What a nuisance. Why would he call me to a place like this?"

A man's impatient shouts drifted in from outside.

My dad, roaring with grief and fury, snatched up the nearest heavy object and stormed out.

"Brandon Blackwood, give me back my daughter's life!"

I immediately followed, seeing the man from my sister's wedding photo, Brandon, with his fingers intertwined with another woman's.

That woman bore a faint resemblance to my sister.

So he was just using her as a replacement!

"Stop acting crazy, old man. Get your daughter out here!"

Brandon disgustedly shoved my dad down and stepped on his face.

"She's dead! You'll never see her again in this lifetime!"

The woman next to Brandon giggled.

"What a joke. Earlier, Sister was locked in with a venomous snake for three days, not only did she not die, but she acted disgusting, like she was with the snake."

"I advised her not to mess around with animals, but she didn't listen and even pushed me.

"Brandon was just thinking of teaching her a lesson by sending her to a monastery to reflect."

Hearing this, Brandon's face turned terrifyingly dark.

"That disgraceful slut! Was she that desperate?"

He looked like he wanted to slice my sister into a thousand pieces with his eyes alone.

"She made me lose all face with the Blackwood family!"

Then, he looked around, raising his voice.

"Cassidy, if you don't show yourself, I'll chop your dad into pieces and feed him to the dogs!"

Having lived with all sorts of animals for so long, I'd seen countless times how out-of-control predators ripped apart their prey.

Now, I saw that same savagery in Brandon.

If I didn't make myself known, he really would kill my dad in the most cruel and vicious way.

"Dad."

I mimicked my sister's manner, helping my dad up. "It's my fault. I shouldn't have doubted Brandon and Seraphina's relationship."

Then, I turned and knelt, begging through tears.

"Brandon, I know I've been bad. Please let me come home."

Brandon squatted down, his cold fingers brushing my cheek.

"That's more like it. As long as you're obedient, the position of Mrs. Blackwood will always be yours."

I nodded hard, then told my dad to take care before hurrying to follow the two in front.

"Cassidy."

My dad grabbed my hand, trembling all over.

"Do... does it have to be this way?"

His neck veins bulged as he spoke with effort.

A father who had already lost one daughter didn't want to lose another.

My nose stung. For years, my sister had been taking care of them.

She always said, "Sister is meant for great things."

"Let this little good-for-nothing take care of Mom and Dad."

"As long as Sister is happy, I'm happy."

But she had no idea that in my heart, she was the little sun that supported me through one danger after another.

I never got to say thank you. I had saved so much for her dowry. We'd promised to watch the sunrise ceremony together, but we never went.

And now she was gone, her body dismembered!

So, even if it meant going through hell and high water, I would get justice for her!

"I promise I'll be fine." I patted my father's hand reassuringly, then turned and quickened my pace.

Carrying a father's helpless despair, I embarked on the path of revenge.
