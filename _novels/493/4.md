A week later was Mr. Blackwood's birthday.

My sister, as the only publicly acknowledged wife of the Blackwood family, was naturally expected to attend.

So Brandon sent people to pick me up.

Compared to when I entered, I was so thin the wind could blow me over, and my gaunt face with two hollow, dark eye sockets was especially eerie.

Brandon looked pleased.

"Looks like you received excellent hospitality."

Brandon lifted my sleeve; my arm was covered in self-inflicted cuts.

I had made them to suppress my restless, animalistic urges.

Indeed, Brandon smiled even more brightly, grabbing and excitedly kissing Seraphina beside him.

They intertwined, making intimate, swallowing sounds.

I kept my head bowed, expressionless, calculating how much longer I needed to torture them.

The birthday gala was about to begin.

Brandon stopped his intimacy with Seraphina just in time.

"Darling, I'll come find you later."

Brandon went to the next room to change.

Seraphina stayed behind, circling me.

"Still not enough. How about this?"

She grabbed my chin, lifting it.

"Tonight's gala has a lot of media here. It would be absolutely scandalous if the Blackwood family's wife performed a strip show right in front of everyone."

Seraphina clapped excitedly and called Brandon.

"Brandon, I've thought of something super fun! Come quick!"

After hearing Seraphina's plan, Brandon dotingly praised her.

"See? I told you my darling was brilliant."

Seraphina laughed triumphantly, wrapping her arms around Brandon's waist.

"I just worry your dad might not be happy."

"He won't be. He already has a thing for that piece of trash. We'll let him have his fun with her later, it'll make him ecstatic."

Brandon's gentle voice sounded like a demon's whisper.

In his eyes, my sister was just an object to be discarded at will.

Worse than a rat in a sewer.

I suppressed my rising fury and stood up.

"Who told you to move! Kneel!"

Brandon's face contorted, and he kicked out. I nimbly twisted my body to avoid it.

At that moment, someone pushed the door open.

They carried a rectangular object wrapped in black cloth.

Then they placed it beside me.

"Who are you guys? And what is this?"

The men carrying the object ignored Brandon, bowing respectfully to me.

I waved them off, signaling they could leave.

One of them said, "My superiors believe you shouldn't dirty your hands with such worthless people."

I nodded, indicating I understood.

Brandon, seeing them leave, chased after them, cursing a few times.

Then he returned, pointing a finger at my nose, demanding,

"Those were your lovers, weren't they?"

"How utterly disgusting. You're just a slut through and through."

I ignored him, pulling back the black cloth.

A vibrant red coffin came into view.

Under their astonished gazes,

I chuckled softly, speaking as if coaxing a three-year-old child.

"The hunting game begins now. Welcome to hell!"

"Are you insane!" Brandon snapped back, his face darkening as he approached. "What's the meaning of bringing a coffin to my dad's birthday?"
