The monastery in the desolate mountains wasn't as simple as it looked; beneath it lay a fully equipped, well-staffed laboratory.

It was funded by the Blackwood family, specifically for researching how to extend human lifespan.

But their test subjects weren't animals; they were people!

When I arrived, I was locked in a tiny, airtight room. A few burly men, laughing obscenely, entered.

"You didn't die last time, even with all that fun. This time, I've got something special."

The man held up a pair of obstetric forceps.

My stomach clenched, and a video recording appeared before my eyes.

My sister's hysterical screams instantly pierced my ears.

She was tied to a bed, and the man standing between her splayed legs held obstetric forceps, laughing as he pulled and twisted.

In that moment, all my blood froze.

Tears streamed uncontrollably down my face.

My sweet, obedient sister, the sister who always saved a share for me, the sister who said we'd be sisters forever!

She was tortured to death, little by little, by them!

"Animals!"

I roared, lunging at the man, snatching the forceps, and violently stabbing them into his eye.

"Ah!"

Blood mixed with shattered bits of eyeball splattered out, and the small room filled with the man's horrific screams.

The others reacted, trying to grab me.

But I had been raised by wild people; I'd long since developed immense strength.

They outnumbered me, but that just meant it would take one more minute.

After knocking everyone down, I grabbed one of them by the collar.

"Do you want to live?"

The man nodded frantically.

"Do exactly what you see in the video to them." I pointed at the screen still playing on the wall.

The men immediately wailed, frantically kowtowing and begging for mercy.

"We were just following orders! Please spare us!"

"We even tried to persuade him back then, but he cursed at us and said he had to use the most extreme methods to teach you a lesson."

"If you want to settle scores, go after the Blackwoods. He even planned to inject you with a newly developed drug that supposedly makes a person rot into a watery mess, little by little."

"Spare you?" I smiled, toying with a small knife. "Did you show any mercy when you laid hands on me?!"

With that, I plunged the knife into the thigh of the man I held.

"Do it or not?"

The man screamed, "Yes! Yes! W-w-w-w-I'll do it!"

I pulled a chair over and sat down.

The man began to act.

Screams echoed endlessly in the room.

I watched with cold eyes, occasionally whistling.

As time passed, the men passed out.

Body parts lay on the floor, and the white tiles were stained red.

A stench of blood and decay permeated the air, making me sick to my stomach.

I pointed at the man who had done the deed. "Clean it up. Don't let Brandon notice any trace, or your end will be a hundred times worse than theirs."

The man had already witnessed my methods and dared not defy me. He cleaned the scene in the shortest possible time.

Soon, the small room was restored to its clean, white state.

I lay on the bed, waiting for Brandon's arrival.
