Rachel Thompson once had a happy family. Her husband, Thomas Wilson, ran a successful restaurant, while Rachel stayed at home as a full-time mom. However, fate had other plans. In May 2005, Thomas, with whom Rachel shared a deep bond, passed away in an accident, leaving her with a 1600-square-foot house and a 3-year-old daughter. At 28, Rachel felt her world crumbling, but for her daughter's sake, she had to be strong.

One morning, Rachel took her daughter Lily to the supermarket. While storing her bag in a locker, she turned around to find Lily gone. Panic-stricken, Rachel searched the entire store but couldn't find her little girl. She was terrified, having already been pushed to the brink by her husband's death. The thought of losing her daughter was unbearable. Just as despair was setting in, Rachel ran out of the supermarket and saw Lily standing not far away. The little girl was contentedly eating a lollipop, her other hand firmly held by a young man in his mid-twenties.

Rachel rushed over, hugging Lily tightly while profusely thanking the young man. He sheepishly scratched his head and explained that he had found Lily alone on the street, guessing she had gotten separated from her mother. Fearing for the child's safety, he had waited with her, believing her mother would come looking. He advised Rachel to be more careful, warning about the dangers children could face. Rachel agreed, insisting on treating him to a meal as a thank you.

During their conversation, Rachel learned that the young man's name was Jake Collins. He came from a rural background, with parents who were farmers. After finishing middle school, he had moved to the city to make a living, starting as a construction worker. Through hard work, he now ran his own construction contracting company.

After the meal, they exchanged SnapChat contacts. Jake often messaged to ask about Lily. Rachel later found out that Jake was three years younger than her and unmarried. His fondness for children and their shared experiences brought them closer.

As they spent more time together, Jake expressed his feelings for Rachel. He admired her independence and capability, sympathized with her struggles, and wanted to help her care for Lily. Rachel, in turn, accepted Jake's affection.

However, their relationship faced opposition from Jake's parents in the countryside. They couldn't understand why their son would choose a woman three years older, especially one with a child. But Jake was determined, willing to cut ties with his parents to marry Rachel, which both surprised and deeply moved her.
