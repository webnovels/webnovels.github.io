The short I posted of my son went viral on the TikTok.
But the attention wasn’t on me.
It was all on him.
The internet instantly recognized the little boy as the miniature version of Isabelle Maxwell, the CEO of the Veridian Group and a notorious heiress in old-money circles.
The netizens dug deeper, and soon, they found the old footage of our breakup, concluding that I was a single dad, abandoned after a messy split.
I sighed. They had it all wrong.
Izzy and I were married before.

1.
I never expected the short to blow up. I’d only wanted to record some mundane moments during what I knew would be our last stretch of time together.
But it went viral.
In the clip, my son, bundled in three layers of pants he kept trying to pull off, gave me the same ice-cold stare he reserves for his pediatrician. He carried a stillness that was far too adult for his age.
The comments were relentless: “This kid is me when my alarm goes off.” “That little face is giving ‘I’m too rich to be here.’”
Then, a particularly sharp comment cut through the noise.
“Wait, why does the little guy look exactly like my boss, Isabelle Maxwell?”
“Like the CEO of the Veridian Group, Izzy Maxwell?”
“No way. I saw this guy at the rundown clinic near my place last week. If he knows your CEO, why is he there?”
“The person above me is right. I see him alone at the local urgent care all the time. He doesn’t look like he has money.”
“I’m not lying—check the side-by-side!”
A comparison photo followed, showing my son's cold side-profile, identical to Izzy’s.
Panicked, I tried to take the short down, but it was too late. That single comment had launched me onto every trending list.
People dug harder and confirmed I was her ex. They reposted our breakup short.
I watched it. It was real.
It was the first time I saw, from a third-person perspective, that Izzy had turned and looked back at me. She lingered, a fragile silhouette in the falling snow, long enough for a thin layer of white to dust her dark coat.
But I, intent on cutting the cord and escaping what I saw as a life sentence, had walked away without a second glance. I’d thrown every toxic, painful word I could think of, swearing I’d never be tied to her again.
Five years passed. Yet here I was, irrevocably linked to her.
Everyone demanded a statement. I didn't give one. I simply deleted the account.
I was terrified Izzy would show up and try to take Eli.
2.
Izzy still ended up on the trend list, all because of my son.
The Veridian Group, usually quick with its PR, issued no statement. They seemed to be under a strict instruction to stay silent.
Eventually, the silence was broken by the Ellington Group. Grant Ellington, a polished society figure, posted a photo with Izzy, claiming her as his fiancée.
He stated, with sickening magnanimity: “We’re all adults here; I don’t care about exes. But the child is pure fabrication. Mr. Harrison, I have to ask, is that child really Ms. Maxwell’s?”
Izzy and I split five years ago. My son is three. The math didn't add up.
The narrative flipped. Suddenly, I was the "deadbeat," abandoning my ex only to have a child with someone else. Some commenters went so far as to call Eli a bastard.
I muttered a curse under my breath. If I could choose, I’d wish he wasn’t hers. I never wanted to be tied to her again.
I turned to see Eli standing in the doorway, a mug of warm milk clutched in his small hands. His fair face was expressionless, but his eyes—dark and sharp—clearly disapproved of my language.
“Dad—” He spoke with that serious, little-man tone of his.
I knew a lecture was coming, so I quickly grabbed the milk and chased a handful of my pills down with it.
“Good boy. Thank you.”
“Goodnight, Dad’s tired.”
I dove under the covers and faked sleep.
Eli watched me for two seconds, his lips pressed into a thin line. He’s small, and he can’t hide his thoughts for long. After a moment, he spoke again.
“Dad.”
“Hmm?”
“Was that lady online my mom?”
He’d seen the comparison photo. They have the same exact profile, the same cold-eyed intensity.
I sat up and ruffled his soft hair, putting on my most reassuring, paternal voice. “Eli Harrison.”
“You’re a brave little man, right?”
“Then you have to be tough because Dad has to tell you some sad news, okay?”
He nodded, his eyes wide and serious.
“That’s not your mom,” I whispered. “Your mom… she turned into a cat and went traveling.”
I watched his eyes widen further with visible astonishment.
“Now, good boy, go digest that for a bit.”
“It’s late, and Dad has to work tomorrow.”
He climbed onto the bed, wrapping his small, warm arms tightly around my neck.
“Don’t be sad, Dad.”
“I’ll stay with you. I won't run away.”
“Goodnight, Dad.” He kissed my cheek.
That warm, little boy. I often marveled at my own courage for raising him alone, despite everyone’s opposition. Watching him stumble and grow, I’d never once regretted it.
3.
The next morning, I dropped Eli off at preschool on my rickety old moped, then headed to the hospital.
I came out hours later, pressing a wad of sterile cotton to my inner elbow. It was one advantage of winter: thick layers hid the needle marks and bruises. It kept Eli from chasing me around asking, “Dad, what happened to you?”
I put on my helmet. Looking down, I saw a new blue thermos and a pair of black knit gloves tucked into the little basket. They were brand new. The thermos held warm water.
I finally understood why Eli had been coming home with empty cans and cardboard boxes all week. My poor, silly boy.
I pulled on the gloves. They were the simplest style, but they made my hands warm. I couldn't stop looking at them.
The cold wind hit, and my eyes felt raw.
What happens to him when I'm gone? I thought constantly. Does he have to grow up alone?
I couldn’t bear it.
I could go to Izzy, beg her for money. Maybe it would be enough to treat this.
But she probably still hated me. She’s too guarded, too controlling; she wouldn’t give me a dime.
Lost in thought, I wasn't paying attention. At a red light, I clipped the side of a sleek black Porsche.
The moment the window rolled down, I froze, the fresh scrape on my hand forgotten.
The woman stepped out. She gave the scratch on the car a detached glance, then looked up at me.
Her familiar eyes—I knew every curve and shadow of them. My fingers curled unconsciously in my pockets. My throat felt stuffed with cotton, sore and swollen. I almost cried right there.
“Mr. Harrison. Long time.” Her voice was cool.
Her eyes swept over the scrape on my hand, then back to the car. She said nothing about it.
After a few moments of quiet assessment, she looked up. “Mr. Harrison, how do you intend to compensate me for the damage?”
Her tone was utterly impersonal, like she was addressing a stranger. Just like she promised five years ago: if I left, she would never forgive me, and we would be strangers.
I was silent. I genuinely didn’t have the money.
Her phone rang. She answered without moving away from me.
“I’m out. You eat first.”
“I’ll be back tonight to see you.”
“The new gallery opening? Yes, Grant. I’ll meet you there.”
She finished the conversation with patient care, then looked back at me, the mask of cold assessment instantly back in place. “Mr. Harrison, the compensation?” she repeated.
She pulled out her phone and opened her payment app.
I looked at it, but didn't scan the code. Instead, I reached for the simple gold signet ring on my finger, the only thing of any real value I owned. I placed it in my palm.
My voice was barely a whisper. “Take this as collateral. I can’t produce anything more.”
4.
Isabelle Maxwell frowned, making no move to take the ring. Her tone hardened. “Noah Harrison. Are you seriously this broke? You took a significant settlement when we divorced. Did you blow it all in five years?”
She had no idea. The money was never enough. Far from it.
I nodded. “My ex-wife developed a severe gambling problem. I spent a fortune paying off her debts.”
Izzy looked at me, a deep frown carving a line between her brows.
I paused, lowering my voice further. “And Eli was a preemie. His heart… he’s always had complications. It’s drained everything.”
“I’ve had a rough time, Izzy.”
The first part was a lie. The second was the crushing truth.
I never remarried. But Eli was a preemie, and he spent over six weeks in the NICU. I remember the long tube running through his nose, reaching down toward his tiny, fragile heart.
I stood there alone, my body still weak from my own private battle, watching him in the incubator. He was so small, so skeletal. His tiny body struggled to breathe even with the oxygen mask.
During that time, the doctors gave me countless terrifying updates. Each time, I signed the consent forms. The month I spent gambling with death felt like a lifetime of torment.
Because of the early birth, Eli spent his entire first year in and out of the hospital. Fevers and feeding issues were routine. But the worst was his heart condition.
When he was five months old, he had his first surgery. When they wheeled him out, his tiny body was a knot of tubes—down his nose, from his mouth, wrapped around his chest, taped to his limbs.
I wanted to hold him, but I was afraid I’d hurt him. I could only carefully grip his icy-cold little hand, whispering over and over that he needed to be strong.
Thinking back to those early years, my eyes stung.
Izzy watched me, her fingers clenched at her side. I saw a ripple of pain in her eyes, but it vanished the moment I looked up.
“You probably wouldn’t know how expensive raising a child is, not having one of your own.” I squeezed my fingers, fighting back tears.
Izzy’s eyes—dark and pooling with unreadable emotion—met mine. Her voice was suddenly hoarse. “How do you know I don’t?”
Oh. She had a child.
I’d seen a photo once on her old phone. She was holding a newborn, gently kissing its wrinkled little face, her expression utterly soft.
Their child must have had a perfect start. The best hospital. The softest crib. The warmest clothes.
My son had none of that.
I bit my lip. I couldn't stand this game anymore. I turned to walk away.
“Noah Harrison. I’ll make you a deal.”
“Five thousand dollars. Apologize to me. And I’ll give you your ring back.” Her voice was the same as it was five years ago: calm, and cruelly detached.
She couldn’t grasp how desperately poor someone could be. So poor they’d trade their pride for cash.
I felt like a wounded animal. My entire body flared with rage.
“Keep it! I wouldn't take it back for any price.”
Blood rushed to my head. I snatched up the thermos from the moped basket and spun away.
Izzy grabbed my arm, her fingers clamping down tight. “Noah, stop. Think clearly. You put that short up to get my attention, didn’t you? You want money.”
Me? Who the hell wants to be tied to her?
I struggled to contain the boiling anger, but it overflowed.
“Better that than you having a bastard with someone else while we were married!”
The moment the words left my mouth, the air solidified.
5.
Izzy lifted her chin, her eyes dark and deep. She gritted her teeth, holding my gaze with a look of pure threat.
“Noah Harrison, I am telling you for the last time. He. Is. Not.”
She loved their child so much she couldn’t even bring herself to use that disgusting, venomous word.
I wrenched my arm free, my eyes blazing with hatred. “What else do you call a child born to another man while you’re still married?”
Izzy’s jaw was tight. She didn't speak for a long time, visibly fighting for control.
“Noah Harrison,” she finally whispered, her voice waterlogged and heavy, suffocating me. “Our issues have nothing to do with the child. You can hate me, but you cannot hate him.”
Why not? Why couldn’t I hate their child? What gave them the right?
The questions choked in my throat. I clenched my fists, but the tears still sprang forth. I forced myself to turn away, desperate not to let her see me break down.
The tension was a physical force. I sucked in the cold air to quell the aching in my chest.
As I looked up, I saw him. Eli. He was standing across the street, holding a huge, ketchup-stained hot dog bigger than his face. He was perfectly still. His small cheeks were red from the cold.
He must have been waiting for ages.
Izzy saw him, too. She called out, just as I was escaping, her voice hoarse. “Noah Harrison. What do you have to say about the boy?”
What was there to say? Did she offer me an explanation when she had another man’s child?
I glared at her, my eyes streaming, and spat out every word distinctly. “Isabelle Maxwell. He is my child. He has nothing to do with you.”
“Don’t disrupt our life.”
“You deserve to be alone.”
6.
I wiped my eyes with the back of my hand and fled the moment the light turned green. I didn't want Izzy to see me crying, and I was terrified she’d follow me to try and take Eli.
I took his small hand and pulled him forward, never looking back until we turned the corner into a quiet alley.
There, I couldn’t hold it in any longer. My chest felt hollow, and all the strength left my body. I collapsed, pulling him into a tight embrace.
All the grief, all the hatred, all the love I’d buried burst forth, suffocating me.
Tears streamed down my face. I couldn't describe the depth of the sorrow.
“Don’t cry, Dad.”
“I’m right here. I won’t go anywhere.”
He used his small hands to gently wipe the tears from my cheeks.
I finally managed to stop sobbing. I stroked his hair.
“Let Dad have a bite of that, okay?”
Eli obediently held out the hot dog, which was covered in a heavy dusting of chili powder. He’d wrapped the plastic bag carefully in layers of paper towels. He unwrapped it and put it near my mouth.
My lips trembled as I took a bite, fighting down the burning heat that scorched my stomach. The tears came again, scalding hot.
I couldn’t let my son see me cry. I stood up, taking his hand to walk home. “Are you hungry?”
“What do you want for dinner? Dad will make it.”
Eli looked up at me, his small hand squeezing my finger. The warmth was comforting.
“Dad, today is your birthday.”
I made it another year. It's a miracle.
I sniffed, wiping my nose. Then I laughed—a ragged, choked sound.
To hell with the diagnosis. To hell with not having long to live. I made it another year.
“Come on! Dad’s going to make you the best birthday dinner ever!”
7.
That night, Eli and I bought a tiny cake. I asked him to make a wish with me.
In the glow of the warm candlelight, I looked at him closely for a long time.
He’s three and a half. It’ll be forever until he’s grown.
I won’t get to see it.
So, I made a long, long wish to stay with him. I wished that every year, he would be safe, healthy, and happy.
We blew out the candles. The ceiling light came on.
He produced a single flower from behind his back. It was slightly wilted. Its color was dull.
I knew he must have spent every cent of his small allowance to buy the cheapest, least perfect flower he could find. For every holiday, he always bought me a single stem from the flower shop near his school. He'd wrap it in cartoon paper and carefully present it to me.
It took him weeks to save enough money. Sometimes, when he couldn't save the full amount, he would bring me one like this—one that wasn’t quite right.
Some children are just born knowing how to love.
My eyes burned.
His face was flushed as he handed it to me, his eyes bright. His voice was soft. “Happy birthday, Dad.”
“Next year I’ll get you the prettiest one, okay, Dad?”
He was making a promise. An appointment for the future.
I took the flower, unable to speak, only nodding repeatedly.
Fine. I’ll just take more painkillers. I’ll hold on for another year. It won’t be that hard.
8.
The next day, I drove Eli to preschool. Snowflakes drifted down from the sky.
Eli loves winter. He loves playing in the snow.
But mostly, he plays alone. Because of his early birth, he’s smaller and frailer than the other kids, and they often pick on him. Whenever I offered to confront their parents, he would grab my hand and say he preferred to play at home so he could keep Dad company.
So, he never cried or complained. He just built snowballs in our small yard, quiet and content.
My heart ached. I constantly felt I had failed him.
Before he got out of the car, I promised him we’d build a snowman after school.
Eli was thrilled. He ran into the building with his small backpack bouncing. I stood watching his retreating back for a long time.
Another winter. He’s a little bigger, but still frail compared to his peers.
I often thought: if he went back to the Maxwell family, he could grow up healthy and safe, free from bullying. He wouldn't worry about money or have to be so fiercely good, saving up cans to buy me a cheap birthday gift.
I looked at the black knit gloves on my hands, suddenly furious with my own selfishness. I’d trapped him here with me, year after year.
He’s suffered too much, following me.
I stood there until the street was empty. The cold air in my nose made my head explode with pain. A sharp, stinging ache erupted in my bones.
A warm, wet sensation dripped from my nose. I wiped it quickly. Another nosebleed. They’ve been happening for a week, off and on.
The doctor said it was inflammation. Medicine, IV drips, chemotherapy… A week of treatment and nothing was working. Finally, he recommended a newly developed foreign drug.
Thirty thousand dollars a shot. I didn’t have it.
I just took painkillers.
Sometimes, when I looked up and saw Eli’s tear-filled eyes, I would cup my hand over my bleeding nose, trying desperately to hide the blood from him.
My brain was throbbing. My vision was blurring.
I crouched down, trying to steady myself. But the dizziness got worse. I forced myself to get up, trying to walk further away. I couldn’t let my son see me like this.
As I turned, I saw Izzy’s Porsche. She was parked on the side of the road, on the phone.
Her voice was low and calm. “Dad, I have to skip tonight. I’m busy… The engagement? If you want to marry off a Maxwell to a society man, you do it.”
My ears were roaring. I couldn’t hear the rest. My vision was swimming.
I tried to walk around her, but my body failed. I was swaying, unable to hold myself up.
Blood was now oozing between my fingers, splattering onto the pristine snow.
The next second, she dropped her phone. She was rushing toward me, grabbing my shoulders with a look of pure panic. She started yelling my name.
