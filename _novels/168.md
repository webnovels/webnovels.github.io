On the wedding day, I was rear-ended by an influencer with millions of followers.

My lawyer husband arrived at the scene and insisted I apologize.

He even transferred a million from our wedding fund to compensate the influencer.

Even more absurd, he left all the guests, canceled the wedding, and personally accompanied the influencer for a medical checkup.

He even became her lawyer and countersued me for "hit and run."

This obvious manipulation by the other woman made me a laughingstock online.

Until that night, the influencer live-streamed herself flaunting a wedding ring and dress identical to mine—three years earlier.

Turns out, I was the one intruding on someone else's relationship.

But I was wrong again.

The truth was even more appalling: the influencer was my husband's brother's true love.

And my husband, who idolized his brother, had agreed to fulfill his late brother's last wish by supporting both households.

After learning the truth, I took off my wedding ring and held a "bachelor ceremony" for this so-called "romantic saint."

Since we're going to shock people, why not let all the influencers his brother knew experience this "harem-like bliss"?
