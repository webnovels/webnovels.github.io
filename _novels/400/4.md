After the original Elara was found, she transferred to Liam and Jessica's school.
But Jessica didn't want the original Elara to share the same car, afraid someone would discover she wasn't the Richard family's true child.
So the original Elara always went to school alone.
In those six months, due to Jessica's subtle hints, she had suffered no small amount of bullying.
But that foolish girl endured it all in silence.
She probably knew that even if she spoke up, no one would care.
And her family would never believe Jessica had instigated it.
I had just pulled my textbooks from my desk when I saw the fake cockroach glued to the cover.
The few kids waiting to see my reaction were already secretly covering their smirking mouths.
The original Elara would have definitely just taken it.
But for me, dealing with such problems was just another Tuesday.
I just wanted to quietly wait to die here, but if they insisted on coming at me, I wasn't some pushover they could walk all over.
I snatched up the textbook with the fake roach still stuck to it and strode towards the girl who'd been openly enjoying the show.
I slapped the book right onto her face.
Before she could even shriek, I dumped all the books out of her desk and found an identical textbook.
The original Elara had always been quiet and unassuming in class, never making a sound.
Today, with my flushed face, I drew the silent attention of many classmates.
Now, my once invisible self was causing such a commotion.
The classroom instantly fell silent.
The girl snapped back to reality and lunged at me like a maniac, trying to scratch me.
I grabbed her hair and said coldly, "I'm letting bygones be bygones for what happened before. Don't you dare mess with me again."
With that, I shoved her away and went back to my seat, slumping down.
Not only was my stomach burning, but I also felt faintly nauseous, like I was about to vomit.
The girl wouldn't let it go, raising her hand to slap my face.
Suddenly, her wrist was caught by Jax, who sat behind me.
His rebellious face darkened. "Too loud."
The girl's eyes widened when she saw it was Jax, and she instantly shut up.
Jax was the undisputed king of the school, a total bad boy.
His family had serious power and influence, so no one dared cross him.
She went back to her seat and exchanged knowing glances with the others who'd been enjoying the show.
A smirk played on their lips.
