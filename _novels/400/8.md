ax hid behind the door, feeling a chill run through him.
After school, Jax had watched the girl wobble out of the school gate, worried she might faint halfway.
After all, they'd shared a bond from half a year of him copying her homework. He inexplicably followed her.
Unconsciously, he'd followed her to the hospital.
He had planned to leave, but a strong emotion held him back.
And then he overheard that the girl had stomach cancer.
No wonder... she was coughing up blood.
Jax felt a knot in his stomach, even wanting to slap himself.
He had bullied the girl for half a year.
He was a terrible person!
But beyond that, a dense wave of heartache washed over him...
When I got home, I intended to pack a few changes of clothes, preparing to move into the school dorms.
But then I found my things had been moved.
Mrs. Davis said, "Elara, Mrs. Richard gave you a new room."
"It's on the same floor as Jessica, the one on the far east side. She said it's so you and Jessica can bond better."
Mrs. Davis looked at me with pity. The Richards family's favoritism was truly boundless.
Almost the entire third floor belonged to Jessica, yet they'd given me only one room on the far east side.
Ha.
I felt a pathetic amusement on behalf of the original girl.
Were they arranging this to warn me that my status in this family would never compare to Jessica's?
But it didn't matter anymore.
I was moving into the dorms anyway, and in just another half a year or so, I wouldn't be in this world anymore.
The daily, agonizing pain told me so.
The girl's desire to break free from this family, and from this world, was incredibly strong.
