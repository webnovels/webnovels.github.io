My original self in the previous world was already dead.
Late-stage stomach cancer, died at eighteen.
I had died a slow, agonizing death from the pain.
There was no one by my side.
Aside from that single fish ball just now, I hadn't eaten anything solid for nearly three months.
Perhaps the System, taking pity on my miserable existence, brought me to this world.
This body also had stomach cancer.
But it hadn't progressed to a terminal stage yet.
The System said the original girl had taken sleeping pills and committed suicide today.
Frequent abdominal pain accompanied by coughing up blood had made her aware of her body's problems.
But she was afraid that speaking up would cause trouble for the Richards family.
Making the family, who already disliked her, despise her even more.
So she chose to simply leave this world.
How foolish she was. The Richards family had vast resources; with proper treatment, she could have definitely gotten better.
This family was truly ironic.
They'd brought their biological daughter back half a year ago and still hadn't noticed she was gravely ill.
"Why am I here?"
A girl who shared my unfortunate fate.
Both orphans since childhood.
Both afflicted with stomach cancer.
Perhaps she was luckier than I.
At sixteen, she was welcomed home by her biological parents.
Perhaps she was unluckier than I.
She never received a single shred of unconditional love before she left this world, becoming an angel.
The System remained silent.
"Has my arrival worsened this body's symptoms?" I asked the System, feeling the metallic taste of blood in my throat.
The System replied, "Yes. Just like your original self, you might... by eighteen."
"But if you cooperate with treatment..."
I spoke calmly, "No treatment."
It didn't matter. I was going to die anyway, so what did it matter? Besides, I didn't want to live.
