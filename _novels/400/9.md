At the dinner table.
I informed Richard and Eleanor that I wanted to live at school.
The family, who had been chatting and laughing, instantly fell silent.
Eleanor frowned. "Why do you suddenly want to live at school? Don't you like the room your mother arranged for you today?"
She suddenly remembered Mrs. Davis's words from this morning: "Elara and Jessica's rooms are quite different, I'm afraid Elara might overthink it."
She then had a sudden realization, thinking Elara had complained to Mrs. Davis, and said impatiently,
"Don't be so jealous. Jessica's room has been hers for sixteen years."
"You've only just moved in. Don't compare everything to Jessica. If you really want it, we can get an interior designer to renovate your room in a while."
Richard's face was even fouler.
"Why aren't you as sensible as Jessica? What will people think if they find out that I, a prominent Richard, let my daughter live at school? It'll just be a joke."
Liam suddenly thought of the boy who had held me today and became annoyed, speaking without thinking.
"Could it be for the convenience of flirting with some wild guy?"
