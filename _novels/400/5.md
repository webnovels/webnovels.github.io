I was in so much pain I couldn't straighten up, cold sweat beaded on my forehead, and I bit my lip hard to suppress the nausea.
The frown etched on my face from the pain wouldn't ease.
This wasn't right.
It shouldn't have progressed this quickly.
This felt like late-stage.
The next moment, I was suddenly lifted into the air.
The jarring screech of a chair dragging across the floor made the whole class turn to look.
I struggled, trying to get out of Jax's arms, but I didn't have enough strength and he held me even tighter.
The tall, slender boy seemed to have endless energy.
"Don't move."
He seemed to see me like this for the first time:
"I thought you were just a meek little mouse, always letting people walk all over you. Guess even the quiet ones snap sometimes."
As we walked, Jax sighed lightly:
"How can you be so light?"
Before we even reached the infirmary, Liam lunged forward, blocking our path, fuming.
Liam's anger surged, and he sneered coldly.
"Elara, are you serious right now? Class is about to start, and you're out here on a date with a guy!"
"Clearly, you have no upbringing at all. You're nothing like Jessica."
My heart suddenly twisted with a sharp pain.
A wave of emotions, not entirely my own, surged through my chest, overwhelming me.
It was always like this...
No questions, just immediate blame.
The pain intensified, and the taste of blood flooded my mouth.
My eyes welled up with tears. I quickly ducked my head, refusing to acknowledge they were mine.
Through his thin summer shirt.
Jax seemed to feel the hot teardrops. His face was etched with confusion.
He had a hot temper, and he said impatiently,
"Who are you? Can't you see she's not feeling well? You just came up and started yelling? Go get some therapy if you're sick, don't throw a tantrum here!"
He started to pull my face away, but then he looked down and saw the angry, bright red scald on my cheek.
"Don't scare me. We'll be at the infirmary soon."
Even if only for a second, I saw Liam's gaze sweep over me.
He must have seen the blood at the corner of my mouth.
His face instantly panicked.
He wanted to follow, but Jessica, who had caught up, pulled him back.
"Third brother, why didn't you wait for me! You ran so fast?"
Liam turned to look at her displeased expression, pushing down the unease in his heart, and stayed where he was.
