When Camryn Storm pushed open the door to the private room, she caught the men inside discussing the power of first love.

"We all shared our stories, Xavion. It's your turn. Don't think you can avoid it this time."

Camryn's hand on the door handle froze when she heard his name.

After a long silence, Xavion Jacobson took a sip of his drink. His deep, alcohol-tinged voice resonated in the room moments later.

"I have her name tattooed near my heart. I've never had it removed. My motorcycle jacket still has a bloodstain from our first time together. I've kept it all these years.

"My current girlfriend is her stand-in."

Each word hit Camryn like thunder, reverberating until her entire body felt frozen. It was as though she'd plunged into icy water.

She was his first love's stand-in?

The room went silent for a beat before erupting into raucous cheers.

"Damn, that's impressive."

"As expected of you, Xavion. You won the game with just three sentences. You're a true romantic, huh?"

"I heard Zara's coming back to the country soon. Since you've never forgotten her, isn't this your chance to rekindle things after all these years? But what about your current girlfriend? Isn't she your sister's best friend? If this blows up, won't it ruin their friendship too?"

Xavion paused briefly but didn't respond.

Seeing someone about to come out of the private room, Camryn snapped out of her daze. Face pale, she stumbled down the stairs on unsteady legs.

It was pouring outside. However, she walked into it as if numb to the world.

Cold raindrops hit her face, mixing with her tears and streaming down. Her vision blurred in the watery haze while the words she had just heard replayed endlessly in her mind. Slowly, buried memories began to resurface.

Xavion was her best friend, Yvette Jacobson's older brother. He was four years her senior.

The first time she met him was in high school when a group of thugs cornered her and Yvette in an alley.

Right when they were forced into a corner, Xavion appeared on a motorcycle. He undid his helmet with his long, clean fingers as his cold voice rang out. "So, you're the ones picking on my family?"

The moment Xavion removed his helmet and revealed his face, Camryn heard her own heart pounding wildly in her chest.

She had heard Yvette rave countless times about her stunningly handsome older brother. Still, the real thing left her breathless. He looked even more dazzling when he effortlessly took down the gang of thugs with a few high kicks.

At the time, every girl at school except for Camryn had a crush. But that day, she wasn't the exception anymore. She had a crush, and it was on her best friend's brother.

By the time she entered university, her face and figure had matured, and with Yvette's encouragement, she finally mustered up the courage to pursue Xavion.

She prepared homemade breakfasts for him every day, orchestrated chance encounters, and found out his interests to create topics of conversation. 

Even though she tried everything she could think of, Xavion always treated her like a child, remaining distant and aloof.

However, there were fleeting moments when he would unintentionally glance at her face and appear momentarily distracted.

Everything changed when he drove her home that one time. When a car accident was imminent, she threw herself in front of him without a second thought.

Fortunately, the brakes worked just in time, and she wasn't seriously hurt. She only had a small cut on the corner of her eye from hitting the car seat, leaving a wound the size of a fingernail.

It was a minor injury, but Xavion, who always seemed unbothered, was uncharacteristically anxious. He not only rushed her to the hospital but also repeatedly asked the doctor if the cut on her face would leave a scar.

When the doctor assured him it wouldn't, he finally relaxed, only to start scolding her right after.

"Why did you jump in front of me? Do you have a death wish?"

Camryn's eyes sparkled as she looked at him, her adoration impossible to hide.

"It's because I like you."

Xavion froze in place before his lips curled into a cold smirk.

"You like me, huh? You're just a kid. What do you know about liking someone? How long could you like me for?"

"Forever!" she declared without hesitation. "Xavion, I'll like you forever."

Perhaps it was the unwavering conviction in her tone or the sheer sincerity in her eyes, but for the first time, Xavion raised a hand and gently touched her face.

As he sighed, he finally said the words she had been dreaming of hearing.

"Camryn, let's give it a try."

From that day on, they officially became a couple.

During the three years Camryn was in a relationship with Xavion, Xavion had always given her the care she needed despite his cold demeanor. Camryn, too, had never dared to ask for more.

But tonight, the conversation she overheard had completely shattered the beautiful illusion she had naively clung to.

It turned out that his occasional moments of distraction while looking at her face were because she was a stand-in.

It turned out that his fear of her face getting injured was because she was a stand-in.

It was only because she was Zara Joel's stand-in that he liked to gaze at her face during their most intimate moments!

Camryn cried so hard it felt like her heart was being ripped apart. The rain drenched her completely, but she barely noticed as she stumbled back home. Drained of all energy, she finally collapsed onto the floor.

Some time must have passed before she began to regain her senses. The tear stains on her face had dried, and her mind felt clear. 

Camryn reached into her bag and pulled out a business card.

Half a month ago, she had performed an original song she had written for Xavion at a bar on a whim. After the performance, a talent scout approached her with this card.

The scout had complimented her vocal talent and striking appearance, asking if she was interested in becoming a singer. The company would send her abroad for three years of secret training and groom her into a top-tier star.

Singing had always been Camryn's greatest passion. Camryn had also always dreamed of being a celebrity. 

But she had turned the offer down, all so she could stay with Xavion.

Even so, the scout had insisted on leaving his contact information.

Now that Camryn knew the truth, there was no reason to stay with Xavion any longer.

Staring at the phone number on the business card, Camryn raised her cold, pale hand and dialed.

The moment the call connected, she cleared her hoarse, weary voice and uttered softly, "Hello, this is Camryn Storm. I'll sign the contract."
