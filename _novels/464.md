My husband, Jake, was a big-shot stylist in the industry.

His clients? All high-spending wealthy women.

He’d come home late, shed his clothes, and just crash.

But one night, I found a receipt in his jacket pocket. Just one item listed: condoms.

The purchase time was 8:16 PM, that very evening.

My blood ran cold. Jake and I hadn't been intimate in ages. So, who exactly was that box for?
