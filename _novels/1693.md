My mother, Deb, was frail, a delicate china doll who told everyone within earshot that she suffered from depression and couldn’t handle any kind of stress.
At our annual Thanksgiving family dinner, I refused the king lobster leg she’d painstakingly cracked open for me. It wasn't spite; it was a severe shellfish allergy.
She burst into silent tears, her voice trembling as she asked why I was trying to cut her out of my life.
My father, Rich, his face already a thundercloud, sharply reprimanded me: “You know your mother can’t handle stress, Cassidy. Why are you always so difficult?”
I remembered forcing it down last time, my throat closing, my skin erupting in painful, grotesque hives that left me looking like I’d wrestled a beehive.
Then, she dragged over the man my Aunt Carol had set me up with—Garrett Cole—and cheerfully insisted we go on a remote hike the next day.
My breathing hitched. I managed a strained, “No, thank you. I can’t.”
My mother started to wail—not just cry, but a theatrical, gut-wrenching sob—claiming I wanted to be a spinster, that I was driving her to take a handful of pills.
The table of relatives, half-coaxing and half-bullying, shoved me into his car.
Up on that isolated trail, I was assaulted, then pregnant, then forced to marry him, the shame of the situation weaponized against me.
After the wedding, the emotional abuse quickly escalated to physical beatings that left me with permanent, life-altering injuries.
When I finally pressed for divorce, my mother came to my hospital bedside.
“You file those papers, and I’ll jump off the parking garage roof.”
Utterly broken and without hope, I chose the only escape left. I stepped off the rooftop myself.
Now, I was back.
I opened my eyes to the exact moment my mother was pushing that lobster leg toward me.


“Cassie, this one’s packed with meat.”
“Your mother wouldn’t dream of eating it herself! I save all the best things for my girl!”
My mother deliberately raised her voice, ensuring everyone heard. I slowly turned my head, my neck stiff, and met her gaze. It was that familiar look: cloying expectation mixed with thinly veiled martyrdom.
The bone-deep realization hit me: I was back. I was home.
Last lifetime, I’d refused the king lobster due to my allergy. She had instantly burst into tears in front of everyone, twisting the knife.
“Are you blaming me because I couldn’t give you a rich girl’s life?” she’d wept.
“You’re too good for this food, is that it? Are you trying to cut ties with me?”
My father, the ever-enabler, had scolded me for being inconsiderate.
Too humiliated to fight, I choked down the lobster, nearly suffocating in the process. Yet, even as I was struggling to breathe, she was busy cramming me into Garrett Cole’s car.
That monster, that domestic terrorist, had destroyed the only life I had.
I remembered my own funeral. Lying unrecognizable in the morgue, she had played the distraught, grieving widow, weeping until she "fainted." But the first thing she did after "recovering" was arrange for me to be buried in the Coles’ family plot.
I would never forget it. The sick, triumphant glint in her eyes as she forced me into the repulsive, itchy yellow burial shroud—the color I’d hated since I was a child.
“I was doing what was best for you, honey. Why wouldn’t you just listen to me?”
Hatred seared through every nerve ending. I balled my fists under the table, tasting the metallic tang of rage.
I reached out, picked up the lobster leg, and with absolute finality, placed it back in her bowl.
“I have a severe shellfish allergy, Mom. I can’t eat it.”
The rehearsed smile on her face froze, then shattered. Her eyes welled up, but this time, the tears looked real—the tears of a performer whose cue was missed.
“Seriously? The minute your own mother says something you don’t like, you try to embarrass me in public?”
“Am I going to hurt you? You will eat this lobster, or I swear to God, I’ll—”
I cut her off, my voice steady and cold, staring straight into her calculating, needy eyes.
“Or you’ll pitch a fit? Throw a tantrum? Maybe threaten to take a cocktail of meds?”
“Mom, if you have a genuine illness, go to a doctor and get medication. You won't cure it by using me as your punching bag and emotional hostage.”
The sudden, brutal honesty hung in the air. The other relatives exchanged uncomfortable, disapproving glances.
My mother stared at me, dumbfounded, before slamming her fork and plate down. “I’m sick because you make me sick! You’re trying to kill me, aren’t you?” she screeched.
My father immediately put his arm around her, soothing her while glaring at me. “Cassidy, enough. Stop this right now.”
With her audience validated, my mother became bolder. She stood up, pointing an accusatory finger at me, her voice shrill.
“I’m her mother! I know her better than anyone! She is doing this on purpose just to undermine me!”
She dissolved into frantic, muffled sobs, covering her face. I almost laughed. It was her signature move: the performance of self-sacrifice designed to drown everyone in guilt and force immediate compromise. This time, I felt nothing but a hollow emptiness.
Aunt Carol quickly scooped up the lobster and dumped it into my clean plate. “It’s a holiday, sweetie. Just apologize to your mother, eat the lobster, and don't upset her. Young people are tough; it’s not a real allergy. You’re just picky.”
The other relatives chimed in with awkward placations. “She’s right, Cassie. You know how sensitive your mother is. Just go with it.”
In the last lifetime, I would have eaten it silently, my skin already itching in anticipation.
This time, I calmly pulled out my phone and held the screen up for the whole table to see.
“I’m not being picky. I have a severe, life-threatening allergy.”
My voice was quiet, but it held the authority of undeniable fact.
“A single bite could put me into anaphylactic shock. This is the discharge paperwork from the last time my mother insisted I just ‘try’ the shrimp.”
I looked pointedly at Aunt Carol.
“Are you suggesting I risk my life again just to prove I’m a ‘dutiful’ daughter?”
The table fell completely silent. Aunt Carol swallowed hard, her face draining of color.
“Well,” she stammered, looking away. “Kids these days are so dramatic. Liz, don’t you worry about it. If she doesn’t want it, forget it.”
Seeing her control slipping, my mother grabbed a fruit knife from the dessert platter.
She began waving it wildly, tears streaming down her face. “You think I don’t deserve to be your mother? Fine! I’ll just end it! I’ll die right here!”
She held the blade against her throat, her eyes red, but clearly waiting for my capitulation. The relatives’ faces contorted with manufactured panic and fury—all directed at me. I was the villain for refusing to be emotionally blackmailed.
I stood up, expressionless, and looked from her frantic face to my father’s condemning one, and then to the pitying-yet-judgemental relatives.
One compromise now would only set the stage for an infinite cycle of abuse. I was done with this life. I was done with her.
I strode purposefully toward the door, shoving the heavy oak panel open, desperate to escape the suffocating air of the private dining room.
But the sight of the man standing on the other side of the threshold froze the blood in my veins.
Garrett Cole.
My husband. My rapist. My abuser.
His eyes slid past me and into the room, a picture of polite concern.
“Mrs. Miller? Is everything alright in here?”
I remembered the hike, the assault on a deserted patch of trail. When I wanted to call the police, my mother had stopped me, her voice a chilling whisper.
“If this gets out, how can I face anyone? Your poor mother has depression, she can’t handle the shock. I taught you to be pure, Cassidy, and you wouldn’t listen.”
Her words, rank and corrosive, washed over me like a tide of sewage, extinguishing the last flicker of hope and self-preservation.
After the wedding, his true self had emerged. Every day, a fresh excuse for a beating or a verbal assault. When I finally showed my bruised face to my mother, she only worried about the neighbors.
“Divorce? Don’t be ridiculous. We’d be a laughingstock. I can’t handle that stress. If he’s hitting you, it must be because you’re not trying hard enough. I told you: be gentle, be supportive, always put your husband first.”
I remember staring at the seemingly fragile woman, wondering, with a cold horror, Did she ever actually love me?
Then came the final escalation. Garrett had seen me talking to the security guard in the parking lot. He locked me in the bathroom, using a steel needle to pierce my fingers. He cut out my tongue and spent seven agonizing hours beating me to within an inch of my life.
When I was finally found, the police charged him with aggravated assault. I was categorized as having Level Two permanent injuries.
My mother’s arrival at the hospital was delayed, but her first request wasn't to see if I was conscious. It was to sign a statement of non-prosecution and drop the divorce.
She cried until her face was swollen. “If you divorce him, I’m jumping off the building.”
Garrett, on bail, had smiled the most chilling, victorious smile I’d ever seen. “As long as your mother is alive, you are stuck with me, Cassidy.”
The memories of that absolute despair—the rooftop, the jump—left me utterly hollowed out. Garrett was the killer, but my mother was the accessory, the co-conspirator. Why did she hurt me so much? The question used to haunt me. Now, I simply didn't care.
I tried to side-step him and get out, but my arm was caught.
My mother’s voice, sickeningly sweet now, wafted from behind me. “Cassidy, where are you going? I’m sorry, alright?”
She had dropped the knife and was standing just behind me, her eyes still red, but a saccharine smile already in place.
“My little girl. Going to get married, and still acting out. Now, this is Garrett. Aunt Carol set you up. He graduated at the top of his class—he’s ten times the catch you are. You need to grab him. Take his number. You two are getting married tomorrow!”
Garrett extended his hand, his expression a picture of gentle, modest charm.
A primal sense of dread flooded me. Only I knew the vicious demon hiding behind that handsome, wholesome facade.
My mother cleared her throat, realizing the room was still a mess of shocked relatives.
“A mother is a fool, isn’t she? No matter how you treat me, my heart is only for your well-being.”
“Now, I’m not going to hold a grudge. You two kids go sit down and chat.” She was forcing us together, finalizing the deal she’d already made with my life.
I yanked my arm free from her grasp, cold sweat prickling my face.
“I have nothing to say to him!”
My mother’s face tightened into a furious grimace, but she grabbed my arm, her grip vise-like.
Aunt Carol quickly pulled Garrett into the room. “Cassidy’s just shy, dear. You two can catch up later.”
Garrett nodded, that polite smile never wavering.
My mother leaned in, a low, savage warning hissed in my ear.
“Stop reading those videos online about not getting married and having children. Wait till you’re old and lonely—then you’ll regret it.”
I scoffed, shaking my head.
“I’m not getting married. I don’t need a man to validate my worth.”
“And I’m certainly not having children. I don’t have the compulsion to control another human being’s life the way you do.”
The temperature in the room plummeted.
My mother reacted like a startled animal. She shrieked, her hand flying up.
“Look at yourself in the mirror! What on earth makes you think you’re good enough to find someone better? You should be grateful Garrett even looked at you!”
I saw the swing coming. I caught her wrist in mid-air and, with all the residual strength of my rage, I shoved her away.
She was completely off-balance. CRASH! She stumbled backward, hitting the floor in a heap of fabric and fake tears.
My father’s reaction was immediate and volcanic. He surged across the room and delivered a vicious, open-handed slap across my face.
The force was staggering. The room went dark for a split second, and I reeled backward, hitting my head on the sharp corner of a wooden cabinet.
Warm, sticky blood immediately trickled down my temple. The intense pain brought with it an icy, terrifying clarity.
I wiped the blood from my cheek and stared, cold-eyed, at every person in the room. There was no fear, no submission. Only resolve.
Garrett raised an eyebrow, a flicker of something that looked like excitement in his eyes. He quickly masked it with a pious frown.
“Cassie, how can you speak to your mother like that?”
That was it. That single sentence, that show of support, lit the fuse on my mother’s pent-up rage and desire for a dramatic performance.
“I was only trying to protect my daughter’s future!”
She hammered the floor with her fists, weeping hysterically.
“What did I do wrong? Cassidy, if you don’t agree to marry Garrett, I’m jumping out that window right now!”
She scrambled to her feet and rushed toward the massive bay window. We were on the tenth floor of this upscale steakhouse.
I watched her, a dead calm settling over me. I knew she wouldn’t take the final step.
I pointed to the blood still oozing from my forehead. My voice was low, cutting through the din of her fake sobs.
It sounded like a thunderclap to everyone present.
“Stop acting, Mom. If you were truly depressed, you’d have been dead a thousand times over already.”
Her movements arrested mid-dash. Her crying caught in her throat for a second. It was the ultimate exposure, the piercing of her most carefully constructed lie. She exploded into an even more desperate, ear-splitting howl.
The relatives surged forward, their shock turning into righteous fury. They were going to teach me a lesson. Punches and insults rained down on me. I curled into a ball, shielding my head.
Amidst the chaos, my trembling hand managed to press the pre-dialed emergency button on my phone.
The police arrived quickly.
The moment the door swung open, my mother, ever the performer, found her anchor. She rushed forward, falling at the feet of the officer.
“Officer, please, you have to help me!” she sobbed, tears flowing freely.
“I have severe depression, I can’t handle stress, and I was just trying to find a good husband for my daughter. But she… she attacked me! She hit me and told me to jump off the building!”
The relatives rushed to corroborate her story, pointing at me and calling me an ungrateful monster. Garrett Cole stepped forward, his face full of tragic concern.
“Mrs. Miller’s condition is very fragile. Cassidy… she was truly out of line.”
Suddenly, the entire focus of blame had shifted to me.
I was taken into custody. However, aside from the obvious injury to my head—caused by my father—there was no other physical evidence of "assault" on my part. My mother, needing to preserve the image of her delicate mental state, was advised to go home and rest.
After giving my statement, I walked out into the chilly night air, no longer caring about the consequences. I contacted an old friend out of state and began making arrangements to leave the country.
But just before boarding the flight, I was intercepted by a small, hostile crowd.
“Cassie! How can you look at yourself, doing that to your sick mother? Don’t you have a conscience?”
I looked closer. My mother had connected with a major "Mental Health Advocacy" live-stream channel. She was weeping to thousands of viewers about how her "unfilial daughter" was trying to drive her to suicide. The carefully edited clips and her agonizing script had instantly ignited social media outrage.
A wave of profound helplessness washed over me as I looked at the angry faces surrounding me.
I noticed a reporter with a camera rolling, and a terrifying, cold calm settled over me.
“Yes,” I said, my voice shockingly level. “Everything you read online is true.”
“I, Cassidy Morgan, told my mother, who claims to have severe depression, to jump off a ten-story building.”
The crowd erupted in shock. The news went viral immediately.
My mother, sensing victory, rushed to the live-stream location. She clearly thought I was finally broken. She played the picture of the forgiving, heartbroken saint, tears welling in her eyes as she reached for my hand.
“Cassidy, I forgive you. All you have to do is agree to marry Garrett Cole. We’ll put the past behind us and start a happy life together.”
I looked at her, my expression serene.
“Fine,” I said.
The word was like a knife in the quiet chaos.
“I agree to marry him. But first, you have to agree to an immediate, public psychiatric evaluation—a transparent check on both of us.”
My mother’s face instantly went white.
“Absurd! My depression is your fault! How dare you question me? You just want to twist things so you don’t have to do what your mother says!”
I leaned in, my gaze intense and challenging.
“Mom, is this genuinely about my well-being?”
“Or is it just a performance, using the guise of illness to demand my absolute and unconditional obedience?”
The crowd went silent. On the streaming platform, comments demanding a psychological test for my mother started flooding the screen.
Finally, under immense public pressure, she gritted out a single sentence.
“Fine! I’ll do the test. I am depressed. I have nothing to hide!”
An hour later, my mother and I emerged from the testing facility. The tension was palpable. Everyone waited for the doctor to speak.
The doctor, a serious, professional man, scanned the room before speaking.
“Based on the comprehensive assessment,” he began slowly, “we have confirmed a diagnostic report of Major Depressive Disorder…”
The live stream comments paused for a collective second, then erupted into a torrent of abuse, cursing me for being a heartless daughter.
Then, the doctor continued, his voice calm and precise:
“…but the diagnosis belongs to Miss Cassidy Morgan.”
“As for her mother, Mrs. Deborah Miller, her psychological indicators are perfectly normal.”
