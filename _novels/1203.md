It was at the low-income street fair, as the city officers were clearing us out, that my ex-husband stepped in.

Rhys sighed, the sound heavy, almost patronizing. “Let’s just remarry, Sera. Wren is too young to be going through this kind of hardship.”

I agreed without a moment’s hesitation.

When we moved back in, I stopped fighting. I stopped throwing fits of jealousy and I stopped demanding his time.

Wren also stopped competing with his childhood friend’s daughter for her father’s attention.

He could spend the night with Lana and her little girl, and my daughter and I wouldn’t call or text.

If we ran into them in public, Wren and I would discreetly fade into the background.

We became exactly the well-behaved, undemanding pair he always wanted us to be.

But then, he looked at me, his eyes reddening. “Sera, why aren’t you angry?”

“Wren, why don’t you just ask Daddy for a hug?”

1

We finished the re-marriage paperwork and walked back to the house.

Rhys followed a step behind. Wren and I were standing at the front door.

“Why don’t you go in?” he asked.

I said, calmly, “The code’s been changed.”

Just then, the door swung open from the inside.

Lana Bellweather stood there in an apron, a feigned annoyance on her face. “What took you so long? Laney’s been asking for you for ages—Oh, Ms. Jones?”

I gave her a small, polite nod.

“Ms. Jones, please don’t misunderstand. Rhys has been so swamped with work, I just came over to make him some bone broth.”

“I’m always forgetting the code, so Rhys changed it to my birthday. I’ll change it back right away.”

But she didn’t move. The triumphant glimmer in her eyes was unmistakable.

“Daddy!”

A small figure launched itself at Rhys’s legs.

Lana immediately clapped a hand over the girl’s mouth, looking distraught, as if I were a threat.

“Laney, Mommy told you to call him Mr. Beaumont, remember?”

Rhys looked over, thoroughly embarrassed.

Seeing that Wren and I weren’t causing the scene we would have years ago, a flicker of surprise crossed his face.

Wren’s room had a lot of new things.

Lana bit her lower lip. “Laney sometimes sleeps here…”

The tiny hand in my palm tightened. Wren whispered, “Mommy, I can sleep in a different room.”

A sudden, dull ache squeezed my heart, a feeling I hadn’t expected.

Before, when Rhys paid attention to Laney, Wren would throw a tantrum, crying, “Daddy is mine!”

And every time, Rhys would snap at me for poor parenting.

Now, she just stared quietly at the transformed room.

Children are sensitive. She already understood that only the favored ones are allowed to act out.

Rhys frowned.

Lana quickly interjected, “I’ll take the things out. Ms. Jones, please don’t be mad at Laney or me—”

The mother and daughter huddled together, trembling slightly, the picture of delicate victimhood.

In the past, these kinds of passive-aggressive remarks would have instantly triggered me, leading to a huge fight with Rhys.

Now, I just looked at them, saying nothing.

Rhys suddenly spoke. “Lana, don’t come in and out of my house so casually anymore. As a single mother, you need to protect your reputation.”

As they finished gathering their things, Laney said tearfully, “Daddy, Laney wants you to take us home.”

Rhys hesitated, looking toward me.

I smiled. “You and Ms. Bellweather have known each other for years, Rhys. Of course you should take them.”

He opened his mouth to say something, but I turned and walked to the kitchen to boil some water.

Before he left, Rhys rushed back in. “Wait for me. When I get back, we need to have a real talk.”

It wasn’t until they were completely gone that Wren and I finally let the air out of our lungs.

A moment later, my phone pinged.

Lana Bellweather: [I’m so sorry, Ms. Jones. Laney is used to Rhys watching her animated movie with her. He’ll be home a little later.]

2

That familiar, apologetic tone.

I smiled faintly and sent a brief reply: [Okay.]

Rhys didn’t come home until the next day. I was reading Wren her pre-nap story.

I didn’t ask any questions.

Throwing a tantrum or getting jealous, like I used to, would only make him resent me and, worse, reflect badly on Wren.

After Wren fell asleep, Rhys handed me a small box.

Inside was a black diamond necklace—the one I had always wanted but was outbid on at an auction years ago.

If this had happened before, I would have joyfully jumped up and wrapped my arms around him.

Now, I felt absolutely nothing.

I used to love jewelry.

But after we moved to the city village, a thief tried to snatch my necklace, pulling me down a flight of concrete stairs. I ended up with a concussion and a bloody mess.

Since then, I realized these things were nothing but vanity, and potentially deadly.

Not getting the ecstatic reaction he expected, Rhys shifted uncomfortably. “Let me put it on you.”

I smiled and stepped back. “Thank you, but I don’t wear jewelry anymore.”

He froze.

I went to the kitchen to cut some fruit. When I came back, Rhys was gone.

In the afternoon, I took Wren out.

For two years, I had barely scraped by, and Wren often wore the landlord’s daughter’s hand-me-downs.

Now, I could finally buy her clothes that fit.

As we entered the children’s boutique, we ran into Lana and Laney.

And Rhys.

The saleswoman was effusive, presenting them with a garment. “Mr. Beaumont, Mrs. Beaumont, these are the new arrivals from yesterday. They would look gorgeous on Princess Laney.”

Laney shouted, “I want this one!”

Rhys smiled and swiped his card.

“Ma’am, can I help you?” Another sales associate approached me.

I spoke softly. “I’d like to buy my child a couple of outfits she can wear right now.”

Rhys and his group looked over.

I pretended not to notice, taking Wren’s hand and walking further into the store.

When we came out of the fitting room, Lana and Laney were gone.

Rhys looked at me, his expression complex. “It’s Laney’s birthday today. I was just buying her a gift…”

“I see. Well, send her my best.”

I turned toward the confused saleswoman. “I’ll take both of these outfits, please.”

As I moved toward the checkout, Rhys grabbed my arm.

I quickly pulled my hand away.

The saleswoman’s eyes flickered between us. “Ma’am, you and Mr. Beaumont…”

I smiled easily. “We’re just acquaintances.”

Clang!

“Mr. Beaumont, your phone!”

I turned back. Rhys was staring at me, his eyes wide. “What the hell are you saying?”

I tilted my head, confused. “Aren’t you supposed to be celebrating her birthday with them?”

He just glared, his chest heaving, but said nothing.

I didn’t understand, but I wasn’t going to provoke him. I took Wren’s hand and headed for the exit.

Just outside the shop, Rhys grabbed me again.

He asked in a low, heavy voice, “You’re just going to let them mistake our relationship like that?”

I laughed, a short, dry sound. “Aren’t you the one who cares the most about Lana’s reputation?”

Rhys was stumped, speechless for a moment. He finally managed, “You’re not like you used to be.”

I used to start a fight over exactly this.

Rhys would always be impatient. “Stop being hysterical. Lana is a single mother and it’s hard for her. If people think she’s Mrs. Beaumont, they won’t harass her.”

But now, what was the point of fighting Lana for his attention?

All I wanted was to raise Wren well and give her the comfortable life she deserved.

I said calmly, “Isn’t this what you’ve always wanted?”

Rhys’s face went white with fury. He flung his hand away and left.

I didn’t care. I took Wren for food and bought her a few more things.

A life where I didn’t have to worry about the rent or the next meal. It almost felt like before the divorce.

After we first got married, I became a stay-at-home wife.

Everyone envied me: a girl with a wealthy father, married to a self-made, brilliant young talent.

I truly thought I would be happy forever.

Until Lana got divorced.

Rhys missed our first Valentine’s Day, claiming he was stuck working late.

But when he finally got home, Lana showed up at our door to “deliver his forgotten tie.”

I was confused.

He just rubbed the bridge of his nose. “Lana works near the office. She just dropped it off on her way home.”

I wanted to ask more, but his exhaustion seemed genuine, and I softened.

I had an easy life at home. He was working so hard.

It didn't feel right to doubt him.

I told myself that a marriage requires trust, and I shouldn’t be foolishly jealous.

But then these instances kept piling up.

On our anniversary, Rhys left me alone at the fancy restaurant to rescue Lana from a conflict with her landlord.

During a sudden downpour, Wren and I were stranded at the preschool, while Rhys drove Lana and Laney home.

Wren caught the flu and had a high fever. I couldn’t reach Rhys, so I took her to the emergency room alone. There, I saw him with an entire team of specialists attending to Laney’s scraped elbow.

Every single time, Lana would preemptively text me.

[I’m so sorry, Ms. Jones. Rhys didn’t want me living there anymore, so he set me up in one of his apartments.]

[I’m so sorry, Ms. Jones. It was all my fault for feeling dizzy. Rhys will be on his way to pick you up as soon as he drops me off.]

[I’m so sorry, Ms. Jones. Rhys is just overly concerned about Laney. I’ll talk to him about it later.]

I finally snapped. I kept questioning Rhys: who was his wife? Who was his daughter?

At first, he would patiently explain.

“We’ve known each other forever, Sera. I’m just helping her out.”

But he grew impatient.

“You have money, you don’t understand how hard it is for people from lower-income backgrounds. Can’t you show her some compassion?”

“Lana is a single mother, struggling. Why do you insist on attacking her?”

“Are you helpless? I have so much to do at work, do I really need to revolve my life around you two?”

“If you can’t raise the child right, hire a new nanny! She’s acting like a bully at this age, she’s going to be impossible later on!”

Wren and I stopped looking forward to his return.

Because every time he walked through the door, the small warmth in our house was replaced by screaming matches.

Wren grew quieter and quieter.

Even her preschool teacher asked me if everything was okay at home.

The moment I truly decided to divorce him was the day of Rhys’s company annual gala.

He told me he was working late.

I’d been constantly exhausted and sleepy lately, and completely forgot about the gala.

Until I saw a post on social media.

[The Henda Tech CEO and his First Lady are a perfect match. Such a movie-star couple.]

The picture was Rhys and Lana standing side-by-side at the gala.

I called Rhys five or six times, but no answer.

The seventh call finally went through, but Lana’s voice answered.

“Ms. Jones, Rhys is very busy right now. You can tell me whatever you need to, it’s the same thing.”

I demanded she put Rhys on the phone.

She gave a delicate laugh. “Ms. Jones, I’m Rhys’s executive assistant. He has no secrets from me, you know.”

“Did you know that tonight, so many people have told me that I’m better suited to be Mrs. Beaumont?”

My body was trembling. I hung up the phone and, still in my slippers, bolted for the gala venue.

Lana had her arms wrapped around Rhys’s waist, leaning fully into his embrace.

I tore them apart in a rage, glaring at Rhys. “This is your working late? Hugging and cozying up with her is work?”

Lana rushed over to grab me. “Ms. Jones, I was drinking. Please don’t misunderstand—”

I violently shook her hand off and glared at her. “Don’t touch me, you home-wrecker!”

My push wasn’t strong, but she cried out dramatically and dropped to the floor.

“Seraphina Jones! What is wrong with you?”

Rhys roughly shoved me aside, rushing to help Lana up, checking her for injuries with agonizing care.

My lower back slammed against the corner of a table. The pain brought tears to my eyes.

Lana, eyes red, fought back tears.

“It’s all my fault. Please, don’t fight because of me…”

Rhys quickly reassured her. “It has nothing to do with you, Lana. She’s being hysterical.”

He turned back to me, his gaze cold, laced with pure disgust. “Seraphina Jones, I have told you countless times, her mother entrusted me with Lana’s care on her deathbed.”

“Do you have any idea how hard it is for her to raise a child alone? How can you, a woman, be so malicious as to call her a mistress?”

The look he gave me was icy, even showing a hint of revulsion.

“My patience is limited. You need to stop this.”

“Don’t make me regret marrying you.”

The words caused a terrible ringing in my ears.

I stared at Rhys, completely shattered.

I wanted to scream: I’m your wife! How can you side with a stranger?

I wanted to tell him: Lana baits me every time! Are you blind?

I wanted to recount the gloating phone call.

But a terrible blockage filled my throat. All I could manage was, “Then let’s get divorced.”

The moment the words left my mouth, I felt a strange sense of freedom.

I didn’t even care about the look of triumph on Lana’s face.

Rhys was stunned, then gave a cold, dismissive laugh. “Seraphina, what else can you do but threaten divorce? Does your life consist of nothing but fighting for attention?”

Then, he helped Lana away.

I went home and sat in the living room until dawn.

It wasn’t until Wren started wailing that I realized my legs were covered in blood.

The second child, who had quietly arrived, had quietly left.

A week later, Rhys and I divorced. I retained full custody of Wren.

Not long after, my father’s company ran into trouble. Several key partnerships were maliciously snatched away. Within six months, we had to file for bankruptcy.

The stress put my father in the hospital with a heart attack. He died after several attempts to save him.

I used the remaining assets to pay the employees’ severance. The heiress became a single mother in a slum.

Wren suffered terribly because of me.

I woke up crying countless times, regretting that I had dragged her into this mess.

This time, I wouldn’t waste a single breath fighting for Rhys’s affection.

As long as Wren and I could have a secure, comfortable life, Rhys could find ten ‘Lanas,’ and I would look the other way.

Rhys never came back that night after leaving the boutique.

Three days later, Wren started at her new school.

I started setting up my online shop.

My handmade pet clothes and small trinkets had sold well at the flea market. Many customers had suggested I start a proper shop.

Back then, I worked as a server during the day and could only set up my stall at night. My output wasn't high enough.

Now, with a little money saved, I could finally launch it.

In my previous marriage, I always had a spare room for my sewing projects. I converted it into a home studio and bought equipment for live craft streaming.

Rhys came home just as I was having dinner.

He walked to the kitchen and looked around. “You didn’t make any for me?”

I blinked. “I assumed you wouldn’t be home.”

He was momentarily speechless.

I quickly headed for the kitchen. “I’ll make some right now. Just wait a minute.”

As I washed vegetables, I remembered—no matter when he came home, I always had a hot meal waiting. Even if it went uneaten and had to be thrown out.

But today, I honestly forgot.

I sighed. I’d have to remember next time.

Dinner was silent again.

After a long time, Rhys spoke. “The company had an issue with a project this week. I was staying in the office.”

“Oh.”

I thought for a moment and added, “That must be tiring. I’ll run you a hot bath.”

He looked at me in silence for a while, then suddenly rubbed his face. His voice was faint.

“You haven’t called me, not even once, this whole time.”

I used to constantly share my life with him.

I’d send dozens of texts a day—even though he rarely replied—because I was afraid to bother him with a call.

But now, I was no longer the Seraphina who lived solely for him.

“I didn’t want to disrupt your work.”

Rhys stared at me, his voice carrying an unclear meaning. “What do you think I’m doing? Something you could disrupt?”

I just smiled. “Whatever you’re doing, it’s not my place to interrupt.”

The air filled with silence again.

I started clearing the table and heading to the kitchen.

Rhys followed. “There are a lot of delivery boxes outside. What did you buy?”

I hesitated for a moment, then told the truth. “I started an online shop. Those are my supplies.”

He nodded, saying nothing.

A moment later, a text popped up. He had transferred a large sum of money to my account.

“Thank you.”

Rhys paused as he reached for the fruit bowl. “We’re married, Sera. My money is yours. Don’t be so formal.”

I smiled and remained silent.

Rhys’s phone rang. The screen showed Lana’s name.

He glanced at me and answered right in front of me.

I wasn’t interested. I wisely walked to the balcony to collect the laundry.

“Lana has an issue…”

I handed him his jacket. “You should go quickly.”

He looked at me intently. “I’ll be back soon.”

Rhys had only been gone for a few minutes when the preschool teacher called. “Wren’s mother, Wren fell off the slide.”

I rushed to the hospital. The teacher explained as she led me toward the room. “Wren had a disagreement with another child…”

As she finished, we reached the emergency room door.

The other child’s parent was also being led in.

It was Lana. And Rhys.
