For the tenth time, my boyfriend Kevin abandoned me at the altar after receiving a phone call from his childhood friend.

I was left standing alone on stage, completely humiliated.

Swallowing my pride, I tried calling Kevin, begging him to come back and finish the ceremony. But he wouldn't even answer my calls!

His childhood friend Zoe smugly sent me a photo of the two of them lying in bed together, taunting me: "I win!"

My heart turned to ice.

Ten weddings planned, and ten times postponed.

The officiant looked at me sympathetically. "Do you still want to continue with the ceremony?"

I forced a smile. "Yes! We must finish it!"
