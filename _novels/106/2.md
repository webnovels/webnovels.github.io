The next day, I scheduled a medical abortion. After the procedure, I left the hospital, clutching my stomach, and went to a nearby restaurant to regain my strength. There, I saw the last person I wanted to see—Kaia.

"Hey! Adeline, did you really sign the divorce papers?" "Hahaha, I told you, how could you compete with me for my brother Jasper?"

I forced myself to sit up and glared at her. "Your method of dealing with me is pretending to be sick to trick Jasper.

Are you so sure it won't backfire one day?"

Kaia shrugged. "Why worry? Even if I am pretending, so what?" "Jasper had so many girlfriends over the years, I ruined them all, and he never said a word to me. But only you, Jasper wouldn't let go, so I had to do this!"

Her face twisted as she stood over me. "Adeline, Jasper loved your high and mighty, obedient nature. But I want to see, if you turn from a good girl to a harlot, what will he think of you then?"

With that, Kaia gave a meaningful smile and left the café. I felt furious and uneasy, but could only suppress it and returned to the old house left by my parents. That night, I slept restlessly, my right eyelid twitching constantly, only barely falling asleep in the early hours.

The next morning, I was awakened by the phone ringing. Looking at it, I saw nearly hundreds of missed calls, from friends and other unknown numbers. A foreboding feeling washed over me, and with trembling hands, I called a friend back.

The next second, my friend's panicked voice pierced my eardrums: "Adeline, what's going on? Do you know your private photos have been spread all over the city!"

My heart skipped a beat, and I quickly opened the video forwarded by my friend.

In it, on a city's Ferris wheel capable of projection, my photos, without a stitch of clothing, flushed and asleep, were pieced together into a puzzle, being completed above the Ferris wheel!

In an instant, my mind exploded, and my whole body trembled uncontrollably.

I remembered the photo. After getting married, Jasper and I had a harmonious intimate life. He was always innovative and even bought a camera to record it. This camera was always well kept by Jasper. But why... why were my photos projected on the Ferris wheel?

Someone had even started a live broadcast, showing everything.

I watched helplessly as the live comments were full of insults, calling me a harlot, a whore...

With shaking hands, I dialed Jasper's number, but it was always off. A flash of realization hit me, recalling Kaia's meaningful smile before she left. Before I could react, a message from Kaia came through.

[Do you like the gift I gave you?] [Adeline, with your wanton appearance, no wonder my brother is so obsessed with you!]

[Do you like this gift? Should I give you another big one?]

I rushed home in anger. When I arrived, Jasper was agitated, and when he saw me, guilt flickered in his eyes. "Adeline, I originally lent that camera to Kaia to take some photos, but Kaia lent it to someone else,"

"I didn't realize there were such photos in it, so..."

Jasper apologized, but Kaia, unseen by him, looked at me with a smug expression.

"Jasper, do you still think Kaia was careless?" I couldn't hold back my emotions any longer and pointed at Kaia, choking up. "This is clearly her pretending to be sick to force us to divorce, then deliberately releasing my photos!"

"She must have been in and out of our room often; otherwise, how could she know where the camera was!"

But Jasper's gaze darkened. "Adeline, stop it! I told you Kaia accidentally did it!"

"This is my fault, but don't worry, I'll handle it!" As soon as Jasper finished, Kaia rushed over with teary eyes. "Brother Jasper, are you going to ignore me?

I'm carrying your child!" "I'm clearly male, how could I be pregnant with your child?

Or did you deliberately want me to have one?"

"She must come and go from our room often; otherwise, how would she know where the camera is?"

But Jasper's eyes darkened. "Adeline, stop overreacting! I've already told you it was Kaia's carelessness that caused this!"

"This is my fault; don't worry, I'll handle it!"

As soon as Jasper finished speaking, Kaia rushed up with tears in her eyes. "Brother Jasper, are you going to ignore me now? I'm carrying your child!"

"But I'm a man, how could I be carrying your child? Or did you deliberately make me have a child?"

Kaia spoke with a smug look, staring at me. I was stunned. A child?

Jasper and Aunt Sue looked uncomfortable. A flash of realization hit me, and I began trembling.

"Jasper, what does she mean? Explain yourself!"

Jasper looked awkward, but the next second, my mother-in-law stood up. "Alright, if you're too embarrassed to say it, I will!"

"Adeline, the reason we want you to divorce isn't just because Kaia is unwell. The most important thing is that Kaia is pregnant with Jasper's child, and it's been two months!"

I stood there in disbelief, frozen. Jasper's face showed embarrassment.

"Adeline, believe me! I was drugged that day and mistook Kaia for you, that's why..."

I took a few steps back, my heart aching as if it were curling up.

Suddenly, I remembered that two months ago, Jasper did say he was set up, but at the time, he explained it as a contract setup. Turns out he was actually involved with Kaia that day...

No wonder he reeked of alcohol when he came back that night, and there was a hint of madness mixed with guilt in his eyes when he was with me. So, he was hiding it from me two months ago...

Cold sweat soaked through my clothes. This is the "big gift" Kaia gave me.

"Adeline, don't blame Jasper and Kaia. Kaia is our adopted daughter, but she has no blood relation with Jasper," my mother-in-law said. "Plus, Kaia has liked Jasper for so many years. It's nothing for them to be together!"

"Just think of it as them playing house. When Kaia recovers, you can remarry!"

My mother-in-law's words interrupted my thoughts.

"Adeline, I know you've always been obedient and sensible, don't be too bothered by it," she continued. "If you're really reluctant to part with Jasper, you can still have a child and be part of our family!"

I let out a sarcastic laugh, tears streaming uncontrollably. This is the man I loved, the man and family I insisted on marrying against my parents' wishes...

Ignoring Jasper's calls, I rushed out the door. When I came to my senses, I found myself back at the old house.

A notification sounded, and I picked it up to see yet another message from Kaia! My heart ached unbearably, and I closed my eyes in pain. What more does she want?!

I opened the message page; Kaia's message appeared:

[You lost! Remember to come to my and Jasper's wedding tomorrow~]

[Sister-in-law~~ I'll make sure you see me and brother happy with your own eyes, you'll be jealous~~]

Attached was a photo of Jasper preparing pregnancy oil for Kaia. My vision blurred again.

If it weren't for Kaia, Jasper and I should have been like this too...

The notification sounded again; this time it was a message from Professor:

[Adeline, the paperwork is done, you're leaving tomorrow!]

I wiped my tears, and my blurred vision became clear again. I may be gentle and obedient, but that doesn't mean I'm willing to be degraded, blindly trusting.

Jasper, Kaia, and my mother-in-law all disgust me. So, this relationship isn't worth keeping.

I picked up my phone, looking for the account owner I hadn't contacted in a long time.

Jasper, if I find evidence of Kaia faking her illness, what will you do then? At that time, what would you do?
