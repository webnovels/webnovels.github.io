"Adeline, we really had no other choice."

I stared blankly at the signed divorce papers in the living room. Jasper's mother spoke with a tone of helplessness and pain, but I caught a fleeting smile at the corner of her mouth.

"Kaia's illness came out of nowhere. She only recognizes her brother, and we watched her grow up..."

"Adeline, we didn't want this to happen. Can you... understand?"

I opened my mouth but couldn't speak. Jasper, who had been silent, looked at me with guilt.

"Adeline, the doctor says Kaia's illness is peculiar, but she's recovering quickly, just a few months."

"Could we divorce temporarily? To stabilize Kaia's emotions, and we'll remarry once she's stable, okay?"

Jasper's eyes were sincere. "Kaia may be adopted, but she's been family for years."

"Exactly!" My mother-in-law chimed in. "

Adeline, a divorce is also good for you. We'll compensate you financially,"

"You can travel for a few months, and Kaia's illness will be cured, not affecting your relationship with Jasper!"

My fingers trembled, and the words stuck in my throat wouldn't come out.

In Manhattan, I'm known as the most famous "good girl" in the upper circles.

My life's decisions were all made by my family, with Jasper being the only exception.

He promised to always love me, and he kept that promise well, except his sister Kaia targeted and pranked me when Jasper wasn't around.

She once said Jasper was her man and I was intruding. My mother-in-law even hinted several times that Kaia was her ideal daughter-in-law. I thought I could endure them with Jasper's love for decades until three days ago when Kaia claimed she could make Jasper divorce me.

Today, she was diagnosed with gender identity disorder, and even got Jasper to sign the divorce papers. Her actions were too fast...

I felt a chill and looked at Jasper.

"Jasper, only by divorcing me can Kaia's illness be cured, right?"

"How can you be sure she's really sick and not faking it to trick you?"

But Jasper's eyes were full of disapproval: "Adeline, you don't understand. Why would Kaia pretend to be sick to make us divorce?" "And what benefit would that give her?"

"Yeah, Adeline, how can you say that about Kaia?"

My mother-in-law disagreed as well. "Alright, stop hesitating and just sign the divorce papers!" I clenched my fist, my eyes hot, my hand instinctively covering my abdomen. I was already two months pregnant, the baby's heartbeat was already there...

I had planned to surprise Jasper and my mother-in-law after returning from the hospital, but what awaited me was a divorce agreement. In the past, when I was dating Jasper, my parents had warned me he wasn't the right person for me.

I didn't believe them. But now, I realize I might have been wrong...

My hand trembled as I picked up the pen to sign my name, pressing hard into the paper. As soon as I finished, my mother-in-law eagerly picked up the papers and smiled. "Good! Now Kaia's illness should recover!"

She looked at me with a more genuine smile. "Adeline, it's good you understand our family's difficulties. I've always told Jasper that you're a good girl and would understand!"

"Don't worry, even if we're divorced, we're still family. This is just temporary!" Jasper also held my hand tightly, full of guilt and love. "I'm sorry, Adeline. In a few months, I'll hold a grand wedding to bring you back in!" I forced a smile, my heart aching.

I went upstairs first, and once back in my room, I couldn't hold back the tears any longer.

Just then, a message vibrated on my phone. It was from my professor. [Xiao Xu, I really hope you'll consider the S-level project research!] [I know a 10-year confidentiality period is hard for you to accept, but you're the head of the institution, and without you, this project will be tough!]

Through blurred vision, I typed my reply: [Professor, I agree to go to Y City. I'll depart with the research team in two days!]

After replying, I slid to the ground as if all my strength had left me. I had already tasted the bitter fruit of marrying Jasper against all odds.

But now, I didn't want to endure this pain any longer. Fortunately, it wasn't too late. Jasper, this time, you personally pushed me away.
