The next morning, I packed my luggage and had someone ship it to the airport. At the same time, Jasper came to the old house to find me.

"I found a flight purchase record; are you going somewhere?"

"Today... is my and Kaia's wedding, won't you come to see me?"

I turned my head, looking at the wounded face of Jasper in his groom's suit. Before and after marriage, Jasper always liked to stick to me. He kept a tight grip on my schedule, always knowing what I was doing, except for the confidential research project in Y City, which I didn't tell him about. At this moment, I was very glad I hadn't told him about it.

"Yeah, going out for a break," I responded lightly.

Jasper was silent for a moment, then spoke with a hoarse voice,

"Adeline, I admit I was a jerk in this matter, and I wronged you," he said, "But I really didn't do it on purpose. I mistook Kaia for you that day, that's why we're in this mess."

"Plus, Kaia is ill now, I really have no choice, can you understand me? I'm in pain too!"

Jasper grasped my shoulders, "Adeline, I know you've always been good and sensible. I've already invited foreign doctors to treat Kaia's illness. As for the child... Kaia's health has always been weak; she can only give birth."

"But don't worry, I won't let this child affect us, so can you attend the wedding and then go for a break?"

I pulled a sarcastic smile, the pain in my heart becoming numb.

"Okay," I heard myself answer.

Jasper's face instantly showed a smile, "Then I'll go to the chapel first, you hurry and come over, I'll be waiting for you!"

I watched as Jasper left in a hurry, picked up my luggage, and took a taxi to the airport.

At the same time, the account owner sent me a folder, [It's handled, you don't need to worry about your ex-husband's wedding!]

[Focus on your own stuff, I've got your back!]

Looking at the message on my phone, I smiled slightly, Jasper, from now on, let's never meet again.

I'm sorry, but it appears that the Chinese text you want translated is missing. Could you please provide the text you'd like me to translate?
