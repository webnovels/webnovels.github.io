At three in the afternoon, the entire Reed family, including Tyler, arrived promptly at my office.

This time, they were summoned as family members of a suspect in the case.

Twenty years hadn't changed Tyler. He was still meticulously dressed, maintaining that innocent, delicate look that made people instinctively want to protect him.

Brooke's attitude was a hundred times more respectful than last time.

“Mr. Vance, I was too impulsive last time. I apologize.”

Mr. and Mrs. Reed stood awkwardly beside her, their eyes on me filled with complex emotions.

I couldn't be bothered with them. My gaze fell directly on Tyler.

“The suspect stays. Family, please wait outside.”

The office door closed, shutting out their sight.

Only Tyler and I remained in the room.

The innocent, pale look on his face vanished instantly.

In its place was an undisguised expression of jealousy and malice.

He eyed me up and down, a mocking smile playing on his lips.

“Alex Reed. No, I should call you Alex Vance.”

“Who would’ve thought, you’re really hard to kill.”

“Thrown out by our family, and you still managed to climb up the Vance family’s high branches. What a skill.”

I looked at him calmly, as if watching a pathetic clown.

“Tyler Reed, this is an interrogation. Please maintain your composure.”

My coldness seemed to infuriate him.

He leaned back in his chair, continuing to provoke me with a sharp, sarcastic tone.

“What? Being a prosecutor makes you special? Don’t you still have to watch enviously as I live a better life than you?”

“Let me tell you, what if you’re a Vance now?”

“In my sister’s heart, you’ll never compare to even my little finger!”

“She only asked for you because she didn’t know you were *the* Mr. Vance. Don’t flatter yourself!”
