In the fifth year of my marriage to Nolan, his first love returned.

He placed her on his maintenance team.

When I questioned him, he retorted, "Do you know why I chose her? Because she's not like you, just a housewife obsessed with romance!"

So, when he asked for a divorce for the twenty-second time, I nodded, "Let's get divorced then."

Nolan scoffed, "Don't come begging me like a stray dog."

I nodded, efficiently packed my belongings while he watched in disbelief.

"Goodbye forever."
