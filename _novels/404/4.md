My throat itched, and I coughed up blood.

The system's punishment yesterday had ruined my internal organs.

Even as I covered my mouth, a drop of blood splattered onto Liam's neck.

He flew into a rage:

"Avery, are you trying to die? Coughing on my neck, how disgusting! Clean it up!"

I wiped the blood from my lips, then gently pushed his head back to face forward. My voice was calm:

"Look ahead, not at me."

Liam quickened his pace, walking closer to the divorce counter.

Before he could put me down, I jumped off his back and quickly grabbed a tissue to wipe his neck.

He still seemed unsatisfied, pulling out tissue after tissue, as if he'd been contaminated with something filthy.

I couldn't help but say:

"Liam Sterling, since you've decided to be with Clara, don't let her down."

Liam frowned, finally looking at me properly:

"What nonsense are you talking about? It's just one day, and you're already this petty and intolerant? Don't worry, once the game is over, I'll give you a lavish wedding. I won't go back on my word."

I curled my lips into a weak smile.

On the divorce papers, I fumbled to find where to sign.

My eyesight was the most severely affected of all my declining organs.

Liam held my finger and pointed to the spot, scoffing:

"What's wrong with your eyes? Are you crying them blind because you're sad about divorcing me?"

I snorted:

"It was so sickening it gave me a stye."

Since Clara returned to the country, I hadn't bantered with him like this in a long time.

Liam angrily pushed my arm:

"Avery, you just can't say anything nice, can you!"

I grunted in pain, taking a while to recover.

His face suddenly changed:

"Are you really sick?"

I acted nonchalant:

"No. Hurry up and finish the procedures. I'm planning to travel abroad for a few days. There are plenty of other fish in the sea, why obsess over one person?"

Everyone present couldn't help but scoff, looking at me with expressions that clearly said, "Stop acting," filled with disdain.

Liam's face remained grim, and he suddenly stood up.

"No divorce."

"No divorce?"

Clara exclaimed in surprise, then her eyes welled up with tears, saying aggrievedly:

"Liam, if you can't bear to, that's okay. I'm willing to be punished. I just have a slight alcohol allergy, I won't die. I'll go buy liquor right now!"

I was speechless, not understanding what Liam meant.

I deliberately provoked him:

"Stop messing around. Or are you really reluctant to let me go?"

Liam, predictably, couldn't stand the provocation and quickly signed the papers.

"If it weren't for your pitiful, pale face, I..."

He trailed off.

Then he took the divorce certificate with a sullen face, turned around, and sat with Clara at the marriage counter.

Everyone crowded around them, their faces joyful.

My business here was done.

I turned to leave, but Liam suddenly called out to me:

"Don't go. Wait until Clara and I get our marriage certificate and post on SnapChat, then I'll remarry you right away!"

Divorce and remarrying? Did he think this was a game?

I perfunctorily agreed and walked out of the registry office.

On the virtual screen, the countdown showed thirteen hours left—enough time for me to handle my affairs.

But I never expected my vision to turn blood-red:

"Host Avery Hayes, task failed. Detected official divorce between the two. Countdown reset to zero!"

I never imagined the system had this trick up its sleeve.

I leaned on the registry office doorframe, collapsing softly to the ground.


Inside the registry office, Liam Sterling was posing for photos with Clara Davis, their heads close together.

The photographer kept calling out:

"Closer, lovebirds! Yes, more intimate!"
