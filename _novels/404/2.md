I stumbled.

"Are you serious? Liam Sterling barely tolerates me today. If I ask him to go on a date with me, he'll definitely think I'm messing with him!"

The system was cold:

"Host has no right to question. You can choose to abandon the task and be erased."

At midnight, I tossed and turned, thinking about the system's task.

Bang!

Liam kicked open the door and dragged me out of bed.

In the darkness, his angry eyes glowed ominously:

"Are you happy now? Because of the scene you caused today, Clara went home sick. I took care of her until past midnight before her fever broke!"

I pried his hand off and forced a smile:

"It was just a game. Couldn't you have called it off? Who would take a CEO like you seriously?"

Liam choked, then sighed softly:

"It was just a game, why didn't you cooperate?"

I said nonchalantly:

"Second thing. Tomorrow, you cancel all your work and spend the day with me."

Liam's face immediately turned cold:

"Avery, are you pushing your luck? You're really taking advantage!"

He slammed the door shut and left.

A bitter taste filled my mouth.

I knew this would be the outcome.

The next morning, however, he still knocked on my door, his face sullen:

"I lost a million dollars today because of you. What do you want, spill it."

Because of me?

More like to get the marriage certificate with Clara as soon as possible.

The system told me the date wasn't the main point; the key was for Liam Sterling to spend six consecutive hours with me.

I took Liam to the mall to pass the time.

The whole way, he never looked up from his phone.

Occasionally, he'd stop outside a women's clothing store or a luxury boutique and just casually buy a ton of stuff.

All of it was for Clara.

In our seven years of marriage, he had never bought me anything. The dress I was wearing was worn out and pilled.

He retaliated against me by poaching my family's business. My dad scolded me for betraying our family, and I was blacklisted by the industry.

No one knew that beneath my glamorous exterior, I lived on the meager salary from online part-time jobs.

I persevered until noon. Liam looked impatient, so I quickly took him to a hot pot restaurant.

Just as we ordered, his face changed as he looked at his phone. He made a call, his voice filled with urgent worry:

"How can you not eat? No appetite without me? Okay, I'm coming back right now!"

He then grabbed his coat and rushed to leave:

"Urgent company business. I'm leaving first."

I knew this must be Clara's doing.

"Will you come back?"

My task wasn't finished yet.

He seemed to remember something and nodded:

"I will."

But I never expected him to return with Clara.

Liam carefully tended to Clara, feeding her, wiping her mouth, acting like he was nursing a paralytic patient.

They looked like an affectionate couple, while I was just a stranger sharing their table.

After that, whatever I wanted to eat, Clara would point to and demand.

I lost my appetite and pushed my forks aside.

She looked triumphant, saying with exaggerated sweetness:

"The food Liam feeds me tastes especially delicious…"

Under the table, she deliberately stomped on my foot.

I hissed in pain, but Liam paid no attention.

Fortunately, we just needed to watch a movie to reach six hours, so I grudgingly endured her.

Who knew there were only two tickets left at the movie theater?

Clara spoke first, her eyes red:

"Liam, you and Avery go watch it. I know she's using the divorce as an excuse to spend time with you, but it's okay, I won't be a third wheel! I'll leave now!"

Liam panicked, quickly grabbing her hand:

"What nonsense are you talking about? Forget the stupid movie, I'll spend the whole afternoon with you instead, okay?"

I pleaded calmly:

"Liam Sterling, just watch this movie with me, and I'll let you go, I won't bother you anymore."

But Liam pushed me away with a shove, and the popcorn I was holding scattered everywhere.

"Avery, stop pretending! I've already told you I could never like someone as selfish, arrogant, and self-righteous as you. Clara is generous and kind enough not to blame you, but that doesn't mean I'll indulge you. I've already been more than generous by taking you shopping today!"

He held Clara's hand and turned to leave.

"Warning: Host is performing passively. Electric shock penalty. Please convince Liam Sterling to return within one minute."

The next second, a powerful current surged through my body.

I instantly collapsed to my knees, my kneecaps hitting the ground with a loud thud, my body convulsing.

Gritting my teeth, I begged with all my might:

"Liam Sterling! Please, come watch the movie with me, or I'll die! Please…"

Liam turned back frantically, his pupils constricting when he saw me on the ground. He instinctively took a step.

"Liam, go ahead. Avery is usually so healthy, but now she's suddenly fainted. She must be seriously ill. Go with her, don't worry about me." Clara suddenly spoke.

Liam's steps halted, and his expression turned cold:

"Avery, now you've learned to fake falls? What are you trying to prove, playing helpless? Don't make me look down on you."

He abandoned me. No matter how much I called out, he never looked back.

After a long time, the system's punishment ended. My face was pale, as if I'd been pulled from water. Many people gathered around, offering to take me to the hospital.

The system warned sternly:

"Task Two completion rate is only fifty percent. If Task Three cannot be completed perfectly, Host, you will still be erased."

The panel changed, displaying only one line of text:

"Make Liam Sterling propose to you."

I gave a desolate laugh, losing all my strength and collapsing onto the ground.

This was an impossible task.

When I opened my eyes again, I was in the hospital.

Chloe rushed to hand me water, her eyes filled with sympathy:

"The doctor said you have organ failure and won't live for more than three days. Does Liam know? Is this why you divorced him?"

I knew this was a side effect of the system's punishment.

Three days?

Only twenty-four hours left.

I didn't want to grovel and make Liam pity me.

After all, I had once been a wealthy young woman; I had my pride.

I shook my head:

"No. Chloe, as friends, I have one favor to ask. After I die, just tell everyone I traveled abroad and settled there. Don't let them see how miserably I died."

Chloe's eyes reddened, and she wiped her face:

"You saved Liam's life during the avalanche back then, but he thought Clara saved him. He's misunderstood and tormented you for so many years, you—"

My phone on the table rang urgently. It was Liam.

Chloe answered, unable to help herself:

"Liam Sterling, do you know Avery is sick!"
