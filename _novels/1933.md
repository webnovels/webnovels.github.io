After being kidnapped and rescued, my sister Seraphina developed PTSD. She swore she'd never lie again.

On her first day back, she curled up, sobbing:

"Avery thinks I'm damaged goods now, doesn't she? It's fine, really. Sleeping in the dog kennel is a huge step up from the filth I was stuck in out in the boonies."

Mom and Dad flipped out. They locked me in the basement with aggressive dogs for three straight days and nights.

But just as I woke from my terror and hunger, Seraphina pointed at me, tears streaming down her face:

"What did I ever do to you? How could you drug me with that aphrodisiac?! Thank God Damian was there to help—otherwise I would've rather died!"

I shook my head frantically, denying everything, but my fiancé—his shirt wrinkled and hair messy—already had this icy look in his eyes.

"Seraphina never lies. Why would she make this up about you? Guess you need to suffer more before you learn your lesson!"

They ganged up and sent me to the strictest psychiatric hospital for 'rehabilitation therapy'.

I was clinging to life by a thread when, in my darkest moment, I made a desperate wish.

The second I finished, my sister—who was being interviewed on live TV—suddenly froze. Her eyes went glassy, and before anyone could stop her, she stripped off her clothes and threw herself at my fiancé!
