I possess the Sacred Blood, and the blood within me can heal any ailment.

In my previous life, it was only after I cured the paralyzed legs of a billionaire CEO that I discovered the Mitchell Family had decreed that anyone who healed Ethan Mitchell would become the lady of their household.

Ethan Mitchell was compelled to marry me. Fiona Johnson, who had risked her life to gather the Himalayan Snow Lotus for him, was so stunned by the news that she fell off a cliff and disappeared.

A year later, Ethan found Fiona's frozen body and forced me to cut my wrists to save her.

"If only I had waited for Fiona to return with the Snow Lotus and heal me, we could have grown old together. You killed her!"

"Lydia Smith, didn't you claim your blood is a miracle cure? Then bring Fiona back to life!"

I pleaded with him tearfully.

"Fiona has been dead for a year. I can heal diseases, but I can't bring the dead back to life."

But Ethan refused to listen to my explanation and watched as I bled to death.

When I opened my eyes again, I found myself back on the day the Mitchell Family asked me to treat Ethan.

Seeing Ethan sitting in his wheelchair with a gloomy expression, I smiled faintly.

"Mr. Mitchell, these legs are beyond repair; no one can heal them."

⋯⋯
