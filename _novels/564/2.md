Barbara's face darkened.

"Bullshit! Your so-called science is the outdated nonsense. This is how my mother raised me, and my precious grandson deserves even better care."

"Besides, who do you think you are? Just a nanny trying to act smart? Don't make me fire you right now!"

She was really on a power trip.

Too bad for her, as a postpartum nanny with 15 years of experience, I'd seen plenty of difficult characters like her before.

I kept smiling politely and nodded. "Of course, you're absolutely right."

Seeing my submissive attitude, a smug look spread across Barbara's face.

I added: "However, if you fire me now, the $300 deposit is non-refundable."

Barbara's lips trembled.

"What? $300? You've only been here one day and you're keeping the deposit? Is there no justice? Why don't you just rob us outright!"

She cursed my entire ancestry, then demanded to speak to my manager.

I calmly handed her my manager's business card from my bag.

The manager is actually my son-in-law. He's very understanding and knows I'm professional and dedicated. Whenever he gets a complaint about me, we end up cursing out the complainant together.

Barbara seemed to do some mental calculations and decided firing me wasn't worth it. She opened her mouth, then closed it without saying anything more.

I smiled again and said: "Mrs. Quinn is my client. Ensuring her and the baby's physical and mental health is my responsibility."

"If you have any issues with me, you're welcome to file a complaint. You can even request a replacement if you'd like!"

Honestly, when dealing with difficult mother-in-laws like her, I'd be more than happy to leave.

Barbara's face grew even darker.

Just then, we heard the sound of the door code being entered. David walked in carrying a pack of diapers.
