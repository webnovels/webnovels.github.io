Everyone was utterly shocked.

"The news about Ms. Stone buying a watch and making headlines... it looks just like the one Liam is wearing!"

"So... Liam really is Ms. Stone's husband?"

Ryan's eyes widened when he saw the watch on my wrist, a flicker of envy and malice crossing his face.

The next second, he swiftly yanked the watch off my wrist when I wasn't looking, sneering, "Liam, how dare you try to fool us with a fake watch! How could someone like you impersonate Ms. Stone's husband?"

"Not gonna lie, this knockoff is pretty convincing. Too bad a fake is always a fake; it'll never be real."

"Serena is about to partner with Ms. Stone, and you're impersonating her husband right now? Are you trying to ruin Serena?"

I glared at him coldly.

"Who told you this watch is fake? It's the real deal, now give it back!"

But Ryan refused, deliberately stuffing the watch into his pocket.

I lunged to retrieve it, but he stumbled backward and collapsed onto the floor, his eyes red as he looked at me.

"Liam, I can't believe you hate me so much. Not only did you deliberately push me, but you're also dragging Serena into this just to get back at me. Fine, I'll take Leo and leave, so we don't bother you anymore…"

Ryan continued to whine and threatened to leave.

Two years, and he was still pulling the same stunts.

And Serena, as always, fell for it.

This time, she also protected him, just as usual, yelling at me.

"That's enough, Liam! Ryan is a sick man; are you trying to kill him?"

"You're the one in the wrong here. Impersonating Ms. Stone's husband, are you trying to ruin our company's partnership? Two years apart, and you've become so malicious!"

Meeting Ryan's provocative gaze, I smirked inwardly.

He wasn't sick at all. His terminal illness was faked, and his medical records were forged.

I had told Serena before, but she wouldn't believe me, accusing me of slander instead.

Even now, she still didn't believe me.

I couldn't be bothered to argue, expecting Serena to continue her tirade as she always did.

But instead, she sighed helplessly.

"Alright, Ryan seems to like this watch, so just give it to him as an apology."

"Let's just drop this whole thing. I'll pretend I didn't hear anything."

That watch was a special gift from Victoria. Let me just hand it over? No way.

I snatched the watch back, saying coldly, "This is a gift from my wife. You have no right to touch it!"

The sharp watch strap cut Serena's finger.

Seeing me refuse to back down, Serena's face darkened.

"Liam, it's just a cheap watch. If it wasn't to give you a way out, do you really think we'd want it?"

"Ryan, it's just a watch, right? I'll buy you an even more expensive and better one. Let *someone* regret it!"

I ignored them, turning to leave the private room.

Afterward, I returned to the hotel where I was staying.

That evening, I freshened up and headed to the business gala.

Before leaving, Victoria sent me a message, letting me know that Wonderland Theme Park's show had just ended, and she was bringing our daughter over. She told me to go ahead and wait for them.

Knowing my wife and daughter loved cake, I grabbed a plate of small cakes, intending to find a seat and wait.

As I turned, I bumped into Serena and Ryan, both dressed to the nines.

Seeing me, a hint of disdain flashed in Serena's eyes.

"What are *you* doing here? What, did you come specifically to reconcile with me?"

"You were so tough earlier! Seems like that was all just an act!"

Seeing the cake in my hand, Ryan mocked, "Liam, you're not a waiter here, are you? I heard their waiters only make four thousand a month. That's less than taking care of our Leo!"

Serena also wore a haughty expression.

"Liam, if you beg me, I might make an exception and let you take care of Leo, for old times' sake."

I said calmly, "Don't misunderstand. I'm not a waiter. I'm here waiting for my wife and child."

Ryan, however, looked as if he'd heard the funniest joke.

"Liam, the only CEO attending this gala with a child is Ms. Stone. Are you actually going to claim you're Ms. Stone's husband?"

"I am."

Hearing me say that, Ryan crossed his arms and sneered.

"Liam, you're clearly addicted to lying! How dare you spout nonsense and pretend to be someone important at such a crucial event, and you're still wearing that fake watch!"

"If Ms. Stone and her husband find out, we'll all be in deep trouble!"

Before I could react, Ryan lunged forward, snatched the watch from my wrist, and slammed it onto the floor.

The sharp strap cut my wrist, drawing bright red blood.

Before I could even cry out in pain, Ryan shoved me hard onto the ground, grabbed a nearby cake plate, and smashed it onto my face, growling, "I'll teach you a lesson, you imposter, on behalf of Ms. Stone!"

Cake smeared all over my face, the sticky cream clogging my nostrils, nearly suffocating me.

I reached up to wipe the cream off my face, but Ryan cruelly stomped on my hand with his hard leather shoe heel, grinding it repeatedly.

Excruciating pain shot through my entire body. I could almost hear my bones cracking.

The crowd in the hall, having heard I was an imposter, all laughed and pointed.

Serena watched the entire thing with cold eyes.

Just then, someone in the crowd shouted, "Ms. Stone is here!"

Everyone immediately turned to look at the entrance. I waved my arms, trying to get Victoria's attention.

But Serena grabbed my hand, whispering, "Liam, behave yourself! I know you deliberately followed me here because you're jealous."

"As long as you don't make a scene, after the gala, I might consider remarrying you. I can even have another child for you…"

She tried to pull me up, but I recoiled in disgust.

Victoria still noticed me. Holding our daughter, she walked towards me, her brows tightly furrowed.

"What happened?"

Ryan's face was full of flattery.

"Ms. Stone, this man is an imposter pretending to be your husband! I've already taught him a good lesson for you!"

Serena echoed, "Yes, Ms. Stone, there's no need to bother with him."

The next second, our daughter let go of Victoria's hand and ran to me. Seeing my disheveled state, her eyes welled up with tears.

"Daddy, why is your face covered in cream? And your hand, it's bleeding…"

Suddenly, everyone present was stunned.

"What? Did I hear that right? Ms. Stone's daughter just called this imposter 'Daddy'?"

"Doesn't that mean this isn't an imposter, but the real deal?"
