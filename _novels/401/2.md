Serena's eyes widened.

"Liam, you blocked me?!"

I found it amusing.

I'd blocked and deleted her two years ago. Was she just finding out now?

Serena's face flushed with embarrassment, and she demanded that I add her back immediately.

But I said coldly, "Just an ex-wife. What's there to add?"

"Besides, my wife doesn't let me add other women. She gets jealous."

Seeing me repeatedly refuse to give her face, Serena's anger flared.

"Liam, are you done with your act? I've given you a way out. If you insist on being stubborn, then we'll divorce!"

In the past, Serena would always threaten me with divorce whenever she was displeased, forcing me to yield.

She thought she could still manipulate me as easily as before.

But I just smirked coldly.

"Serena, did you forget? We already divorced two years ago."

At my words, the entire room fell silent.

Serena was stunned for a moment. "Divorced? When did we get divorced?"

Then, as if something clicked, she sneered, "I get it! This is your little game, isn't it? Playing hard to get? Two years apart, and you've certainly gotten more cunning!"

I rolled my eyes in exasperation.

"Serena, didn't you see the letter I left two years ago?"

Serena looked confused. "What letter?"

Before I left the country, I had left Serena a letter.

Inside the envelope, along with the wedding ring I'd taken off, was a signed divorce agreement.

I had made her sign that divorce agreement on the day she insisted on aborting our child, despite my pleas.

She was always dismissive of me; she hadn't even looked at it before signing.

She probably hadn't even bothered to properly read the contents of the envelope two years ago.

That's why she didn't know we were already divorced, thinking I was just throwing a tantrum.

Thinking of this, I scoffed, and with a flourish, pulled out my duplicate copy of the divorce agreement from that year, thrusting it in front of Serena.

"Serena, the letter I wrote you back then contained a signed divorce agreement. I made two copies, and this is the other one. Look closely, we're already divorced."

Serena's beautiful eyes widened. She was about to say the divorce agreement was forged, but when she saw her own signature clearly on it, she froze.

"This is really my handwriting? How? I never signed..."

"No, you did. Remember the document I handed you on the day you scheduled your D&C procedure?"

My reminder made Serena realize belatedly that the document I'd made her sign that day was the divorce agreement. Her face turned ashen.

Everyone else was surprised too.

"Liam actually initiated the divorce? Has his 'love-struck' spell finally broken?"

"If they're divorced, why is he back? I bet he still can't let Serena go."

Hearing this, Serena lifted her chin, confidently believing I still had feelings for her.

Little did she know, my return to the country was primarily to accompany my wife and daughter.

Victoria was attending a business gala back home, and our daughter wanted to visit Wonderland Theme Park during the spring break.

I'd just arrived when I received the class reunion invitation, so I decided to drop by.

I was about to shatter Serena's illusion when her phone rang. It was her assistant.

"Ms. Smith, we just got word that Ms. Stone, CEO of Stone Group, is back in the country with her husband and child, and they'll be attending the business gala tonight. The chairman wants us to add an extra seat and treat them exceptionally well."

"The chairman specifically emphasized treating Ms. Stone's husband well, as Ms. Stone is fiercely protective of him. If we can win over her husband, future collaborations are guaranteed."

Only then did I realize that Serena's company was hosting this business gala.

After Serena hung up, everyone started showering her with flattery.

"Serena, Stone Group is a powerhouse! Your company landing a partnership with them means a brilliant future!"

"I heard all the big shots in the business world will be at this gala. Can you help us old classmates make some connections?"

Serena's eyes gleamed with triumph as she glanced at me, speaking condescendingly, "Liam, are you regretting stubbornly divorcing me now?"

"If you agree to take care of Leo, I might consider remarrying you…"

I scoffed inwardly.

Stone Group was my wife's company, and I was the very husband they were so desperate to impress.

Before Serena could finish, I coldly interrupted, "Stone Group wouldn't even *look* at your company."

Beside her, Ryan, who had been silent for a long time, gave me a disdainful look.

"How would *you* know?"

I articulated each word clearly: "Because, I *am* Ms. Stone's husband."

At my words, everyone looked at me as if I'd lost my mind, like I was an idiot.

Ryan even burst out laughing.

"If you're Ms. Stone's husband, then I'm Ms. Stone's father!"

"Who doesn't know Ms. Stone dotes on her husband? She once made headlines by splurging hundreds of millions on a watch for him! Ms. Stone's husband is a priceless man, worth hundreds of millions. How could a low-life like you impersonate him?"

"Look at yourself! What part of you screams 'Ms. Stone's husband'?"

But I unhurriedly rolled up my sleeve, revealing a large, diamond-encrusted gold watch on my wrist.

"Are you talking about *this* watch?"
