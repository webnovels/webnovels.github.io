My roommate used my name to date a billionaire online, but sent him her own beautiful photos.

So when the billionaire discovered I was just a 200-pound fat girl, he furiously destroyed my family's company.

My parents jumped from a building in despair, and I followed them down.

My roommate came to my grave wearing a huge diamond ring, her face full of grievance:

"Rosalie, he proposed to me! It's such a shame you jumped so early. Otherwise, with your 200-pound body as my bridesmaid, you would've made me look absolutely stunning by comparison."

"I only used your name to date him online because I felt sorry for you—fat as a pig and obviously never having experienced love. Who knew that the moment he saw you, he'd be so disgusted he'd bankrupt your family? I hope you'll be happy in your next life."

Fortunately, I was reborn.

Now, there are still three months before Adrian sees me.

In this life, I'll make her understand that using someone else's name requires repaying with your life.
