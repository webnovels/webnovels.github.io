At my wedding, to save his adopted sister, my husband shoved me—three months pregnant—into the arms of our enemies as an apology.

"This is my sincerity. You can do whatever you want with her."

I didn't cry, didn't fight. I simply followed our enemies, docile as a lamb.

Because in my previous life, I'd traded all my wealth for freedom, desperate to return to Liam.
But I was forced to drink abortion pills, writhing in agony for three days and three nights.
"Brother, those enemies were just people you hired to play a part. Alice didn't lose her virginity, so why did you insist on getting rid of the baby?"
Liam scoffed.
"A performance needs to be convincing, doesn't it?"

I died consumed by hatred. When I woke again, I chose to let them drag me away.
But three years later, as I walked into the gala with my new partner, Liam lunged at me, his eyes wild.
"Alice Summers, where's our child?"

...

Three years. Liam felt like a complete stranger.

"Alice, you don't know how much Liam and I have been looking for you these past three years. I've felt so guilty."

I didn't even spare Chloe a glance, using all my strength to pull free from Liam's grip.
Liam's face darkened at my cold indifference, his voice dripping with fury.

"I asked you, where's our child?"

I let out a cold laugh. It was utterly ridiculous.

"What about the child? Don't you already know?"

Three years ago, what should have been the happiest day of my life – my tropical island wedding – became my eternal nightmare.
How could a man who threw his pregnant wife to their supposed enemies for his adopted sister have the nerve to ask me that question?
If I hadn't been reborn, how could I have carved out a chance at survival for myself?

Liam's gaze flickered, and the hand he reached out to grab mine retracted.
Chloe's eyes welled up, her red-rimmed gaze fixed on me.

"Alice, even though you were taken by those enemies for three years, you must have suffered a lot. And your body... But Liam and I don't care."
"When a woman falls into a hellhole like that, we all know what she has to sacrifice. Even though Alice was defiled, it couldn't be helped..."

Her tone was full of pity, but her words were laced with pure malice.
Liam's face instantly turned grim, his dark eyes trembling slightly.
By now, the party guests had gathered, their eyes shifting as they heard Chloe's words.

"She's a slut! How does she have the nerve to show her face here?"
"She's probably been passed around, right? But her body's still pretty good. If I were her, I wouldn't be able to resist, ha ha ha..."

Liam clenched his fists, like a lit stick of dynamite.

"Have you caused enough trouble?"
"Get home, now! Don't embarrass yourself here!"

My expression instantly changed. Home? Which home?
I glanced at Chloe's slightly swollen belly, my eyes mocking.

"Is there still a place for me in your home?"

My gaze swept the room. Why wasn't he here yet? I had no patience left for these people and just wanted to leave.
But they both seemed to misunderstand my meaning.
Chloe nervously clutched her stomach, cowering behind Liam like a frightened fawn.

"Alice, my... my baby is just an accident. The doctor said my health isn't good, and if I had a miscarriage, I might never be able to be a mother. That's why Liam let me keep the baby."
"Don't worry, I'll go abroad after the baby is born. I won't bother you and Liam again."

If Chloe hadn't crashed every single date Liam and I ever had, acting as a third wheel, I might have believed her words. But every single time, without fail, Liam had sided with Chloe.

"Alice, why are you so petty? Chloe is just an immature kid. If she doesn't come with me, she'll cry in secret at home. Would that make you happy?"
"Alice, I just wanted to learn how to date!"

Gradually, I became numb to Chloe's presence. I didn't care anymore.
Because I knew, caring was useless.

Chloe's tears fell onto Liam's shoulder, and he instantly looked heartbroken, pulling her into his arms.

"Chloe's baby was an accident, and I'm definitely responsible for it."
"I'll register our marriage with Chloe first, then we'll divorce after the baby is born, so the child's identity will be legitimate."

He then looked at me with what seemed like pity.

"Alice Summers, for the next few months, take good care of Chloe at home. Only then will the baby warm up to you. As long as you behave well, I'll give you the status of Mrs. Reed."

Hearing the word "divorce," I clearly saw the resentment in Chloe's eyes toward me.
In a flash, I finally realized where Chloe's inexplicable malice had come from all these years.
Chloe wiped her tears and reached out to pull me.

"Alice, just come home with us. Liam bought me a lot of clothes and jewelry; I'll give them all to you, okay?"

I was about to push her hand away, but in the next instant, I saw it—on her wrist, she was wearing the emerald bracelet my mother had left me.

"Why is my bracelet on your hand!?"
