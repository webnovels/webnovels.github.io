When I married him, my friends were blunt. "He's broke and not even that cute. You could clearly do better."

I just smiled. "The love he gives me is priceless."

Who would have thought that a year later, Julian suddenly became rich overnight and immediately replace me with some young college girl?

He figured I was too soft to leave, so he grew bolder.

He even made out with his mistress into my room, on the very day I gave birth.

But there was one thing he never knew: the curse that runs in my family's blood. And the price for breaking it is one he could never afford.


Our family carried a generational curse: the more one gave in the marriage, the more the other would be forced to repay, multiplied, after a divorce.

That's why when I found out Julian was cheating, I didn't make a scene.

"Anya! Mom says you poured out her chicken soup. She spent three hours on it. How could you be so disrespectful!"

Julian hadn't been home in a month. The moment he stepped through the door, the accusations started.

I was still nursing our newborn. His words made me flinch. "That soup was from your last visit. It was leftovers then. It's been in the fridge for thirty days. It's moldy. It stinks."

Brenda, my mother-in-law, started crying nearby. "I was saving it for myself! You threw it away without my permission! You have no manners!"

Julian immediately scowled. "She's being frugal, if she wants to keep it, let her keep it! The fridge is big enough, what's wrong with letting her store it?"

My anger flared. "The fridge is packed with freshly stored breast milk! If that chicken soup went bad and affected the milk, and Summer gets sick, are you going to take her to the hospital?"

"If the breast milk spoils, you can just pump more, right?"

Julian said it so casually, completely ignoring how much agony I'd gone through to get my milk flowing, or how much time I'd spent carefully storing it.

Brenda chimed in, echoing Julian's sharp accusations. "If my granddaughter gets sick, it's your fault! What good is making three thousand bucks a month? It's all thanks to my son supporting you! Your fancy university degree is useless; your 'salary' isn't even as good as my niece who only finished high school!"

My vision swam with anger.

I didn't have a job, no income, wasn't that because I'd quit after I got pregnant?

I lay weakly on the hospital bed. Julian was working non-stop, day and night. I couldn't even get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night without help, having to ask a nurse.

I kept telling myself Julian was working hard, and I swallowed my resentment.

Until one day, I went downstairs to buy groceries and saw him leaning against his car window, chatting intimately with a beautiful college student. She even kissed him on the cheek.

After she left, he lit a cigarette and, with a smug grin, chatted with the building's security guard.

"What do you think? Eighteen, much fresher than my wife."

"My wife went to a fancy university, but she still pops out babies for me, mops floors, and washes dishes."

"I'm not going home. If I do, I'd have to help with the kid, right? It's utterly annoying..."

"You don't know, after she gave birth, her figure's all swollen, ugh. Doesn't wear makeup, doesn't wash her hair, a complete slob. Just looking at her makes me sick."

Every single one of his words hit me like a lightning bolt, crushing my shoulders.

He seemed to have forgotten.

The down payment for the house we were living in? He'd borrowed my savings for it, and still hadn't paid me back.

I couldn't take it. I stormed over to confront him, but he felt humiliated. Right in front of the security guard, he slapped me hard across the face twice, then kicked me. "Bitch, how dare you talk to me like that? You need to remember who supports this family, who gives you the money you spend!"

He was right. As soon as my maternity leave was over, the company fired me.

Now, I was just a stay-at-home mom, reliant on my husband.

I touched my face, swollen like a balloon, staring at him in disbelief.

Only one thought burned in my mind: I had to get revenge.

Luckily, he still didn't know about my family's curse.
