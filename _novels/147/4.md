Lena's last words reminded me of my grandfather's instructions. I picked up my phone and dialed that number.

I had just put down the phone when Charles burst in, bringing a chill with him.

"Lily! What did you do to Lena again? She came back crying, saying you cursed at her and tried to hit her!"

"And you shamelessly sent those photos of yours to my friends. They're all laughing at me now!"

Just then, the older nurse came in with a medicine tray. Seeing Charles, her face immediately lit up with a smile.

"Mr. Shaw, you're here? Mrs. Shaw just woke up, her spirits seem good."

"These past few days while she was unconscious, you've been here day and night without rest. You're truly a model husband."

"And such a devout Christian too. Mrs. Shaw is so blessed to be married to a man like you."

Blessed? I almost laughed out loud.

As before, the medical expenses were deducted from our joint account.

He used my money to buy his reputation as a compassionate soul, openly transferring our marital assets.

Hearing the nurse's words, the dark clouds on Charles' face instantly dispersed, replaced by a gentle expression.

He walked to my bedside and took my hand:

"Lily, we're husband and wife. Taking care of you is what I should do."

"Your health isn't good, so don't overthink things, and don't quarrel with young girls."

He even bent down and lightly kissed my forehead in front of the nurse.

As those cold lips touched me, I felt a wave of nausea.

The nurse nodded approvingly.

"She's just too willful," Charles sighed, his tone indulgent yet helpless. "Alright, the doctor says you can be discharged. I'll take you home."

With that, he bent down and scooped me up in his arms, ignoring my wishes.

I stiffly allowed him to carry me, smelling the faint sandalwood scent on him, feeling nothing but irony.

Back home, the house was a mess, filled with unfamiliar odors.

My precious antique zithers were all gone, replaced by a shiny drum set. Several Western instruments were strewn haphazardly nearby.

Charles followed behind me. Seeing me frozen in place, he impatiently waved his hand: "Come on, they're just messing around. I'll buy you new ones later, it's not a big deal."

Lena's gang of black classmates were gathered around the sofa, making faces and snickering at me in hushed voices.

Charles ushered them into his room. If saving one soul was good, saving many was even better.

When Charles came to me that night, he caught me sending messages.

Seeing him with beads of sweat on his forehead, I quickly stepped forward and snatched the phone from his hand.

"Your body hasn't recovered yet. What are you doing playing with your phone?" he said.

He tried to unlock it, his fingers swiping the screen a few times, but it remained dark.

He had forgotten that the password was our wedding anniversary.

He grew impatient but eventually tossed the phone back to me, probably thinking I couldn't cause any trouble in my current state.

"Get some rest early," he said curtly before turning to leave.

The TV in the hospital room was playing a local news segment.

On screen, Charles wore a well-tailored suit, looking spirited and energetic.

Beside him were a radiant Lena and her classmates.

The news headline read: "Philanthropist Charles Shaw's Boundless Love: International Aid and Cultural Integration Across Races".

The host praised Charles' charitable deeds in passionate tones, saying he had promoted cultural exchange and understanding.

The scene switched to Lena nestled against Charles, smiling charmingly at the camera.

"Charles has always taught us that all beings are equal, and love knows no boundaries of nation or skin color," she said.

"His acceptance of me and my people is the greatest kindness and respect he could show us."

Her tribespeople also expressed their gratitude to Charles on camera, praising his compassionate heart and magnanimous spirit.

Charles had indeed held another charity gala to boost his image.

Lena was invited as a special guest to share her experience of being helped, while also promoting Charles' company.

I attended in simple attire. When Charles saw me, he said: "Lily, there are many important guests today. It's good that you're dressed like this, it shows purity."

Lena, on the other hand, wore a fiery red dress dripping with jewels, hanging on Charles' arm like the hostess.

On stage, Charles spoke at length about Christian teachings and universal love.

Lena gazed at him adoringly from the side, while her classmates chimed in with their broken English.

Just as Lena was thanking Charles, the lights in the banquet hall suddenly went out.

Amidst the screams, several dark figures rushed in.

After a moment of chaos, the big screen lit up, showing an image of me beaten bloody.

The leader of the kidnappers pointed a gun at me, grinning viciously at Charles on stage: "Charles Shaw, want your wife to live?"

Charles' face turned ashen.

Lena screamed and hid behind him.

The kidnapper sneered: "It's simple. Strip naked in front of everyone and kowtow three times to the screen. Then we'll let her go."
