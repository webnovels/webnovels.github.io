At Deer City International Airport, as the last flight of the day landed smoothly, Mia Collins rubbed her sore right shoulder and walked out of the air traffic control tower.

Mia gazed thoughtfully at the heavy snow falling outside the floor-to-ceiling windows. Just moments ago, she had received a job offer from British Airways. In one month, she could go to England and become a pilot again. At that moment, her best friend Sophia Wilson called.

"It's not good, Mia. I heard that Jake Sanders' old flame, Zoe Parker - you know, the one who competed with you for that special training spot in Australia - she's back in the country. Word is the flight department is throwing her a welcome party," said Sophia. As Mia's colleague in the control tower and her best friend, Sophia was the only person in all of Deer City Aviation who knew that Jake and Mia were married.

On the other end of the line, Sophia carefully asked, "Mia, Jake will definitely be there. Are you going?"

Mia paused. Indeed, the entire Sanders Aviation belonged to Jake Sanders. Looking at the gradually darkening sky outside the window, Mia realized she hadn't seen Jake for over a month. Their only interaction recently was when Jake was in the air and Mia was in the control tower.

"I'll go. You go first, I'll be there a bit later," Mia replied.

When Mia arrived at the bar, it was already past 9 PM. She didn't go in, but could vaguely see the scene inside through the glass door. Mia gently pushed the door open, creating just a small gap, but she could already hear people inside egging others on.

"Mr. Sanders actually chose the dare today. Doesn't he have to do the intertwined drink with our beautiful Zoe?" In the flirtatious atmosphere, Jake calmly picked up his glass and drank with the girl beside him.

Zoe was facing the door and clearly saw Mia. A smug smile instantly spread across her stunning face, as if to say, "See? This is your husband."

Everyone clamored for the two to finish their drinks. Unexpectedly, Jake said nothing, took Zoe's glass, and drained it in one gulp.

"Oh my, Mr. Sanders is being so protective. No wonder his old flame is back in the country. That's some serious impact. Don't tell me we'll be drinking wedding wine in a few days?" The guys joked shamelessly.

Ironically, Jake didn't deny it with even half a word. Mia stood there, her hand that was about to push the door stopped, and her thoughts suddenly went back to that year.

Back then, Mia had just gotten pregnant and went to the bar late at night to pick up a drunk Jake. But at the private room door, she overheard words that kept her awake all night.

"Jake, if you had to choose between Mia and Zoe, who would you pick?" Jake's good friend asked this question, and Mia instantly tensed up.

"Zoe."

That night, she wandered alone on the streets until dawn. Jake didn't call even once.

When dawn broke, Mia walked back to the villa and saw Jake passed out from drinking. From then on, their relationship suddenly cooled to freezing point.

Mia had originally lost the courage to enter, but remembering Evelyn's words, she still pushed the door open. The noisy private room suddenly fell silent.

"Jake Sanders, I need to talk to you." Mia didn't even glance at Zoe, her gaze fixed firmly on Jake. Other colleagues started whispering. Jake stood up and pulled Mia outside.
