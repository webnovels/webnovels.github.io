After being reborn, I'm going to make sure my brother becomes an internet celebrity.
My brother, Mike, would prank me daily on his live streams, all to become famous.
If I dared to resist, Mom and Dad would scream at me for being ungrateful, for hindering their precious son from becoming a big-time streamer.
For a mere $300 viewer challenge, Mike locked me out on the back patio.
I cried, telling them my heart condition was flaring up, begging them to let me in.
But hearing about my heart condition, Mike even insisted Mom and Dad keep me outside, claiming men were tougher and less susceptible to the cold.
That night, the temperature plummeted from over ninety degrees Fahrenheit to fourteen below zero. 
A terrifying, apocalyptic deep freeze descended.
I was frozen to death on that patio.
Within a month, the temperature dropped to -139 degrees Fahrenheit, and the entire world was encased in ice.
When I opened my eyes again, I was back to the day Mike started his insane live streaming.
This time, it was my turn to sit in a warm, safe bunker, enjoying hot food, watching them struggle in a frozen hell!
