Lily was surprised.

Not by the news, but by how these coworkers were all protecting me.

"I didn't realize you had such good connections, Daniel. How much did you pay them to cover for you like this?"

The girls who wanted to add me on SnapChat exclaimed while looking at their phones: "Wow, it's true! Daniel Thompson, CEO of Thompson Tech. A new generation entrepreneur who shot up the rich list. A role model for young entrepreneurs. Mr. Thompson, you're amazing!"

Lily was stunned. Just as she was about to search for herself, her friend shouted: "Chris! Over here! Come quick, someone's bullying Lily!"

Lily's face immediately lit up: "Chris!"

Chris walked over in designer clothes, clearly giving off rich kid vibes.

He glanced at the thin, sickly Lily with a hint of disgust in his eyes, but still put his arm around her shoulder affectionately and said, "Who dares to bully our Miss Sanders?"

Lily's cheeks flushed as she said proudly: "See? You ignorant girls who've never seen real rich people. This is a true wealthy heir, the son of the city's top billionaire family, my boyfriend."

She looked me in the eye, emphasizing the word "boyfriend".

In our three years together, she had never publicly called me her boyfriend.

Even when her father asked, she only said: "Some lapdog is willing to revolve around me. I pity him, so I didn't reject him."

After showing off, Lily pointed at me: "Chris, it's him. I've already made things clear, but he won't stop pestering me."

Chris pushed up his sunglasses arrogantly: "Daniel Thompson, why are you still bothering Lily?

She doesn't like you, and your status isn't worthy of her.

Considering you took care of her for three years, when we get married, I'll specially reserve a seat for you. You don't need to bring a gift, just bring some takeout containers."

I snorted with laughter: "First of all, let's be clear, I'm not bothering her. Our company is having a dinner and we happened to run into each other. Secondly, for your wedding, I won't come empty-handed. I'll definitely give you two a big gift."

Lily rolled her eyes: "Alright, stop putting on airs. I've already texted your dad to come see what you've become. If you kneel down and apologize now, I'll have Chris cover the trouble you've caused tonight. Otherwise, you might have to work here for ten years to pay it off."

Chris looked confused: "What trouble?"

I took out a black card and put it on the table: "Thanks for the concern, but I can afford this small amount. I've also texted your dad to come see what you've become."

Lily was startled: "Why did you text my dad? Still so nosy! Chris, hit him! Beat him up!"

Chris stared at my black card in shock. He knew this wasn't something a small-time employee could possess.

Lily pushed him: "What are you waiting for? Hit him!"

Chris didn't dare move: "Daniel, you... you're not being kept by some rich older woman, are you?"

"Chris!" My company's HR manager, who had just arrived, heard Chris say this.

He rushed over to defend me: "How dare you talk to our CEO like that?"

Chris was utterly confused: "CEO? He's a CEO?"
