I picked up a beer bottle from the table and asked my secretary, "How much is this beer per bottle?"

The secretary replied, "Twenty dollars."

Lily crossed her arms and sneered, "Did you hear that? Twenty dollars. For someone like you who thinks taking a cab is too expensive and always carpools with coworkers, that must hurt, right? Considering your dad's loyal service to my family, I'll treat you to this bottle. Drink up and get out of here. Don't embarrass yourself."

I had indeed changed cars quite frequently this past year.

Some were gifts from business partners, some I bought because I liked them.

Every time the driver dropped me off at the hospital, Lily would see me getting out of a luxury car from the window with my lunchbox, and she'd say with disgust: "Why don't you just buy a car? Or at least take a cab. Stop carpooling with rich coworkers all the time. You're poor but pretentious. I find it embarrassing even if you don't!"

I never explained. I was planning to tell her when we got married as a surprise. Who knew...

"No need for you to treat me," I said.

I looked around at the people watching the scene unfold.

When Lily was speaking recklessly earlier, the bar owner thought there was trouble and even stopped the music.

So now everyone was watching us.

I smiled and said, "Drinks are on me tonight. Everyone, drink as much as you want. It's all on my tab."

The crowd was stunned. After hearing Lily say how poor I was, they thought I was joking.

My secretary stood up and said, "Our CEO is treating everyone to drinks."

When they heard I was actually a CEO, everyone cheered excitedly: "Thank you, Mr. Thompson!"

The bar owner cheered the loudest.

A few young women in revealing outfits came over: "Mr. Thompson, are you single?"

I nodded, "Of course."

They all rushed over to toast me: "Mr. Thompson, can we add you on SnapChat?"

"Sure," I accepted without hesitation.

Lily snorted lightly and pushed those women aside: "Are you all blind? He's just putting on an act! He has no money! He's definitely not a CEO!

Daniel, is this really necessary? Are you willing to spend your father's life savings just to stand tall in front of me for once? Do you want me to call your dad?"

My secretary couldn't help but retort: "What life savings? Our CEO is one of the top 50 on the new rich list. He's handsome, talented, and worth over a billion dollars. You're the blind one for not treasuring such a great man!"

Lily didn't believe it at all: "I know you're his college classmate. I'd be an idiot to believe you covering for him. Worth over a billion? How dare you say that. If he's really worth over a billion, I'll kneel down and lick his shoes."

"Then go ahead and lick," I said.

My subordinates pulled up all the news reports about me and shoved their phone screens in Lily's face.
