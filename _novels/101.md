Five years ago, I was found by the wealthy Collins family and discovered to be their long-lost daughter.

Later, I married Jack Thompson, a principled lawyer who grew up with my brother. Jack was the childhood friend of my brother Ethan, a forensic pathologist.

On the night of my birthday, my brother and husband went out in the pouring rain to rescue Olivia, who had been kidnapped. Olivia was the girl who had been raised as the Collins' daughter before I was found.

In an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town, Jack discovered a mutilated female corpse.

My forensic pathologist brother Ethan, wearing a mask and gloves, calmly dissected the body. He carelessly tossed aside an undeveloped fetus he had cut from the dead woman's womb.

After Jack burned the fetus to ashes, he poured sulfuric acid that he had prepared in advance over the corpse that Ethan had already processed.

They worked together seamlessly to destroy all evidence of the crime.

But what they didn't know was that the corpse belonged to me.
