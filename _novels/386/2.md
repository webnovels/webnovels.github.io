"Honey, can you close the window? The wind is a bit chilly."
I lowered my eyes, still closing the window. The scent of cedar - Ethan's favorite - filled my nostrils.
An awkward silence fell over the car.
After a while, Lily suddenly said:
"Honey, where's the capybara charm I hung in your car?
"Why did you take it down?
"I made that charm specially for you as a good luck charm."
I turned the steering wheel, saying offhandedly:
"I think I lost it."
Lily immediately frowned, her tone tinged with impatience:
"Adrian, what are you saying?
"That was a good luck charm I made for you with my own hands!
"What do you mean you 'think you lost it'?"
I glanced sideways at Lily.
It seemed she had always been like this.
Usually gentle and sweet.
But the moment something she liked was challenged, she would immediately lose her temper.
She took advantage of the fact that I loved her, always pushing my buttons on this point.
But this time, I didn't feel like indulging her anymore.
"Lost means lost. I don't like capybaras.
"I'm the CEO of a public company after all. We don't have a housekeeper, and I don't have a driver.
"How does it look to have a capybara charm hanging in my car?"
Lily had said she didn't like having extra people in the house, so I had let go of the housekeeper. We didn't even have a part-time cleaner.
Every day after finishing work at the company, I still had to come home and clean.
At first, Lily would help with the housework, but she always had excuses - this part hurt, that part was sore.
Of course I wouldn't expose a young girl's little tricks, so I just went along with it.
But later she became more and more excessive, not even letting me hire a driver.
It wasn't until today that I understood why.
"Ethan says a home is a little nest for two. With a third person, it's no longer just the two of us."
"Ethan says his passenger seat is only for me to sit in. Even he won't sit there, because he's the driver."
"He can only be my driver."
In her diary, she had meticulously recorded every memory of her love with Ethan.
Suddenly I felt utterly drained.
Lily hadn't spoken for a long time in the car, just sitting there with red-rimmed eyes, waiting for me to comfort her.
But when my gaze fell on the redness around her eyes, I was reminded of how she had locked herself in the study drinking alone last night.
