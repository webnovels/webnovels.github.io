I got pregnant with my boyfriend who has a low sperm count.

His mother offered me a huge sum to leave him.

I thought it was a joke and wanted to share the joy of my pregnancy with my boyfriend, but then I heard a woman talking about taking wedding photos with him.

To get rid of me, he and his fiancée conspired to paint me as the other woman.

I ended up tearing apart our “home,” erasing all traces of myself, and boarded a plane abroad.

Two years later, Gideon found me in a frenzy.

He stared intensely at the little child beside me, who bore a striking resemblance to him, and his eyes instantly welled up with tears. "Is this...mine??"
