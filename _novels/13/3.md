After returning to my room, I changed my clothes as quickly as possible. At the same time, I heard the commotion outside getting quieter, as if Adam had taken his friends and left the house.
I sat on the bed, tears falling uncontrollably.
In high school, it was no secret that Adam and I lived under the same roof. People often joked that I was Adam's child bride.
It happened so often that Adam finally snapped, slamming down the book in his hand with a cold face.
"I don't like idiots. Stop associating us in the future."
Compared to someone like Adam who was always at the top of the class, I was indeed not very smart, always hundreds of places behind him in rankings.
I knew what Adam said was true, but I still felt sad inside. Even studying hard at home in private didn't help much, and I didn't dare ask Mom and Dad for tutoring.
Instead, it was Adam who accidentally saw me studying at home and casually tossed me his unused notes.
The top student's notes were indeed helpful. My grades improved significantly, and I attributed it all to Adam's notes.
At that time, I used my saved pocket money to prepare a beautiful notebook for Adam, secretly placing it in Adam's desk drawer. But I never imagined that when Adam took out the box with my name on it, the notebook had turned into lingerie.
I still remember Adam getting angry. In front of the whole class, with an ashen face, he threw that box along with its contents hard at me.
"Melody! Can't you have some self-respect? This is outrageous!"
The box hitting me really hurt. I was slow to react, watching the bright red lingerie fall to the ground, feeling a chill from head to toe, not understanding why my gift had turned into this.
Suppressed laughter and whispers immediately erupted around us.
I was at a loss for words, feeling my face burn hot. Adam's embarrassed and angry gaze made me feel even more cornered with nowhere to hide.
That incident ended with me being forced to transfer schools amidst all the gossip at school.
Fortunately, Mom and Dad believed me. They knew I wasn't the kind of person who would do such a thing.
Only Adam, from that day on, looked at me with nothing but cold disgust. The already thin relationship between us completely broke, becoming increasingly estranged.
That night, Adam and his friends didn't come back.
Mom and Dad were out of town and hadn't returned. I was scrolling through TikTok when I unexpectedly came across a video of Adam.
On the screen, against the background of a noisy bar, the camera was focused on Adam.
Someone holding a phone asked loudly, "Adam! Tell us now! Melody or Cassy, who do you choose?"
In the video, Adam seemed to have had a bit to drink, but his eyes were still clear. He didn't even hesitate for a moment, a careless smile on his lips.
"Cassy."
Decisive and straightforward.
The screen went dark, leaving only my pale face.
From then on, I started deliberately avoiding Adam.
When he came home on weekends, I would find various excuses to stay at school. Even on days when I had to go back, I tried to stay in my own room as much as possible, reducing the chances of running into him.
We became like two parallel lines living under the same roof, never intersecting.
But Adam changed a bit. In the past, he never cared about any of my social media posts, but these days he started frequently liking my posts on Facebook.
I don't know how many times I picked up my phone, saw the scenic photos Adam had liked, thought for a moment, and still chose to delete them.
Along with the other posts Adam had liked in the past few days.
It was as if doing this could really make our relationship return to something purely platonic.
But no matter how much I tried to avoid him, when I received a call from Mom and Dad saying I had to come back for dinner tonight, I had no choice.
"Melody, your brother has decided to go abroad as an exchange student for a while. Come back tonight, we'll have a farewell dinner as a family."
I didn't know how to feel. Perhaps it was relief.
If he left, I wouldn't have to hide so carefully anymore.
I couldn't refuse Mom and Dad again, so I had to go home reluctantly.
But as soon as I got home and opened the door, I saw a girl with delicate features standing with Adam.
When they heard the sound and looked at me, Adam hadn't had time to retract his doting smile for her.
My gaze lingered on the girl. Wasn't it supposed to be a family dinner tonight? But why... why was Cassy here?
