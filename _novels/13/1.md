I was just about to enter Adam's room with a plate of cut fruit when I heard laughter from inside.
"Adam, when are you going to marry Melody?"
"We heard your parents are practically hounding you about it. Last time you ran out in the middle of an experiment, it was to take your mom's marriage-pushing call, right?"
"Your family is interesting, adopting an orphan and still following the old 'child bride' tradition... But seriously, Melody has been devoted to you, only liking you from the beginning until now. As for her looks and figure..."
Another burst of laughter erupted, mixed with suggestive undertones.
"She's just the type men like, and conveniently has an empty head. You can easily manipulate her to do whatever you want in the future. How perfect!"
My hand, ready to knock, froze. My heart sank.
That's right, everyone knew I liked Adam.
But everyone also knew he didn't like me.
Sure enough, his voice rang out, clearly annoyed.
"Whoever likes her can have her. I won't marry her no matter what. Weren't we going to play games? Are we still playing or not?"
Adam didn't want to discuss it, but someone always had to push the topic.
"If you don't like her, then it must be Cassy. Everyone knows our talented Cassy only smiles for you!"
The teasing continued in waves. Outside the door, I stood holding the fruit, unable to move, feeling suffocated and miserable.
Unlike his vehement denials when teased, Adam only chuckled lightly when Cassy was mentioned.
Then came the sound of glasses clinking and chairs moving. The topic seemed to have been forcibly changed.
I'm an orphan, adopted by the Lewis family when I was very young.
From an early age, people joked that I was Adam's future bride. Mom and Dad never stopped them, always smiling as they watched us, saying they were observing our compatibility.
Later, when more people said it, Mom and Dad would ask me too.
"Melody, would you like to marry Adam in the future?"
"Yes!"
After that, I followed Adam around like a little tail, but he always kept his distance.
At the dinner table, he would push the food I put on his plate straight into the trash without even looking at it.
When Mom and Dad asked him to pick me up from school, he ignored it. I would wait by the roadside until dark, then slowly walk home alone.
When I saw him at school and greeted him, he acted as if he didn't hear me, walking past me expressionlessly.
Some people privately speculated about our relationship, but he always said he wasn't familiar with me and not to associate us.
I didn't understand what I had done wrong to make him dislike me so much.
I snapped back to reality, looking at the tightly closed study door, just like the barrier between Adam and me.
He was inside, and I didn't even dare to knock.
I thought for a moment, then decided to take the cut fruit back to the kitchen, staring at the carefully arranged plate of fruit.
"Well, well, what's our little beauty hiding here for?" a frivolous voice sounded behind me, making me turn around sharply.
I was startled by the voice behind me. I turned to see Paul, Adam's friend, who was one of the people talking upstairs earlier.
He leaned against the kitchen doorframe, his eyes shamelessly roaming over my body, a smile with unclear intentions on his lips.
Seeing that I didn't answer, Paul seemed to get more excited. He crossed his arms and walked a few steps closer to me, his gaze falling on me without any restraint.
"But Melody, how do you have such a good figure... None of my girlfriends are as... hot as you."
The man's slightly flirtatious comments made me frown instinctively. I was about to leave when Paul suddenly grabbed my arm.
"Where are you going?"
