"You must be little sister Melody? I've often heard Adam mention you."
Cassy was beautiful. She took the initiative to shake my hand, then familiarly linked her arm with mine.
The moment he saw me come back, the smile on Adam's face disappeared without a trace, and he turned to enter the kitchen.
Cassy was lively, talking about how she was about to go abroad with Adam as exchange students, and might even share an apartment with him in the future.
"Adam is so attentive and considerate. He even suggested we live together, worried about my safety as a girl alone. Your brother is really a good man."
I forced myself to squeeze out a smile uglier than crying.
"Yes, he's very good."
Very good indeed, so good that I've been chasing after him since childhood, yet I can't even touch his shadow.
I was so immersed in my own thoughts that I didn't even hear clearly what Cassy said afterwards. At that moment, I just nodded and said "good" mindlessly, not realizing that Cassy had just asked me if I thought it was good for her and Adam to be together.
"Dinner's ready."
I instinctively looked up and saw Adam, who had returned without me noticing, standing in the hallway not far away, his gaze heavy as he looked at me.
My heart skipped a beat, and I quickly averted my gaze.
Mom and Dad's attitude towards Cassy's presence was lukewarm, only polite at best. Cassy kept trying to liven up the atmosphere, but neither Adam nor I said a word.
Just then, a pair of chopsticks reached over, placing a glistening piece of sweet and sour ribs in my bowl.
I froze, looking up at Adam.
A nameless anger suddenly surged in my heart.
I silently used my chopsticks to push that piece of rib he had picked for me to the side.
My heart felt sour and bitter.
He had always disliked me, even hated me a little. Why did he have to create this illusion of caring about me before he left?
After dinner, Adam got up to send Cassy home.
I returned to my room to sort out some seasonal clothes.
As I passed by the living room, I heard Mom and Dad's lowered voices coming through the slightly ajar door.
"...It seems Adam really doesn't like Melody." It was Mom's voice, tinged with a sigh.
Dad was silent for a moment before saying, "You can't force love. We can't push the kids too much. We've always said the two of them would be together when they grow up, thinking that from childhood to adulthood..."
Mom continued, "That's true. By the way, the Chen family brought up the marriage arrangement again a few days ago. I think that Chen boy seems quite steady..."
"Mm, I've met the Chen boy a few times. His character and abilities are not bad, and his family background is comparable. It's just that I don't know if Melody..."
Yes, Adam doesn't like me. Everyone knows that.
Even Mom and Dad have finally given up.
That's good.
I know Mom and Dad's business hasn't been going well lately. The Chen family is someone Mom and Dad want to partner with. If I can play a role in this, it's a way to repay Mom and Dad for raising me.
I took a deep breath and pushed open that slightly ajar door.
Mom and Dad looked at me in surprise.
I tugged at the corners of my mouth, putting on an obedient smile.
"Dad, Mom."
"I'm willing to get engaged to the Chen family."
