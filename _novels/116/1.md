I took a few more steps forward, wanting to get a clearer look at the man's face.

But before I could get closer, the door slammed shut.

I looked up to see my mother-in-law's angry face.

She snarled at me, "What are you looking at? Your sister-in-law has suffered enough. Doesn't she deserve a chance at happiness?"

My mother-in-law's words left me bewildered.

I just wanted to see who the man in the bed was. It had nothing to do with whether my sister-in-law deserved happiness or not.

I said, "Mom, you've misunderstood."

My mother-in-law glared at me and shouted, "Misunderstood? I saw it with my own eyes. What else is there to explain? You're just jealous of your sister-in-law because she has a man who loves her. You're uncomfortable with that, aren't you? Let me tell you, no matter whose child Ruby bears, it will be registered under your late brother-in-law's name. Don't think you can hog all the family's assets for yourself."

My mother-in-law's attitude towards me was terrible.

Earlier in the day, she had wanted my husband to father a child with Ruby.

But my husband had refused.

So my mother-in-law believed I had whispered in his ear, and she resented me for it.

I said, "Mom, I just thought the man in Ruby's room looked a bit like Lucas. I wanted to get a closer look, that's all."

As soon as I finished speaking, my mother-in-law became even angrier. She pointed at my nose and yelled, "Mia Collins, do you have any conscience? Lucas has been so good to you, and yet you still suspect him. Are you even human?"

Lucas had indeed been very good to me. He was the CEO of a major corporation and was always busy, but he still made time to be with me.

He would accompany me to pottery classes, leaving our marks on clay pieces like ordinary couples.

He would even attend concerts of obscure singers with me.

At one concert, there were barely any people, only about 80 or 90 in the audience.

I casually remarked, "It would be nice if there were more people."

Lucas then called in a crowd of thousands, and the quiet concert suddenly became packed.

When reporters caught Lucas there and asked why such a wealthy heir would attend the concert of an unknown singer, Lucas kissed my forehead in front of the cameras and said, "Because of my wife. Whatever she likes, I like."

Lucas's words were reported by all major media outlets, and the unknown singer became an overnight sensation.

People believed in Lucas's taste. If a singer could capture Lucas's interest, they must be talented.

Seeing that I remained silent, my mother-in-law glared at me again and said harshly, "How did Lucas end up marrying an ingrate like you? You don't know how to appreciate him at all. All you do is suspect him. Now get out of here!"

I nodded, "Alright."

I walked towards the door. Because Lucas had refused to father a child with Ruby, he was being punished by kneeling in the courtyard.

As long as Lucas was still kneeling in the courtyard, it meant I was just being paranoid.

I went to the courtyard, the lights were on, but Lucas wasn't there.

Where had he gone?

Just as I was feeling confused, Lucas came running back hurriedly. His clothes were wrinkled, and his face was sweaty.

I even caught a whiff of perfume on him.

It was Ruby's perfume.
