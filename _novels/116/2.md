My heart sank again.

A bad feeling crept over me.

I was terrified that the man in Ruby's room might be Lucas.

Lucas ran up to me, patted my head, and said breathlessly, "Mia, why did you suddenly come out here? Go back inside, it's cold out here."

I instinctively looked at Lucas's knees. They were clean, with no trace of dirt or any signs of kneeling.

I clenched my fists tightly and stared at Lucas, asking, "Where did you just go?"

Lucas laughed nervously, stumbling over his words, "I... I just went to the bathroom."

Lucas and I had been together for 5 years. I knew his habits well.

Whenever he lied, his eyes would look down at his shoes.

But why was he lying to me?

Could he really be the man in Ruby's room?

No, that's impossible.

Lucas loved me so much. How could 5 years of love change so suddenly?

Lucas wasn't that kind of person.

He came from a wealthy family, and there were many beautiful women who wanted to get close to him.

But in all our years of marriage, he had never been involved in any scandals.

I trusted Lucas.

But I was still anxious.

I calmly said, "Lucas, you're lying. You can't fool me. Where did you really go just now?"

Lucas was stunned for a few seconds. His brows furrowed, and his expression turned unpleasant.

It seemed I had guessed correctly.

He had lied to me.

Lucas grabbed my shoulders and said, "Mia, you're acting strange today. Did you hear or see something?"

I removed Lucas's hands and said angrily, "I'm just asking where you went just now. What does that have to do with whether I heard or saw anything? Why do you seem so guilty? You haven't done anything to betray me, have you?"

Lucas was visibly upset. He said with a hint of anger, "Mia, for your sake, I was punished to kneel in the courtyard and was beaten by my father. Now you're saying these things to provoke me. Can't you consider my feelings? Stop being so suspicious. Ruby and I are innocent. I can't give Ruby a child. At most, I'll just take good care of her for my brother's sake."

I laughed coldly to myself. I hadn't even mentioned Ruby, Lucas had brought her up himself.

And his tone of voice betrayed his guilt.

I smiled and said, "Lucas, I just asked where you went just now. Why are you telling me all this? Don't you think you're protesting too much?"

Lucas frowned deeply, growing irritated. "I really went to the bathroom just now. If you don't believe me, that's your problem. I still need to continue my punishment. You go back upstairs."

With that, Lucas knelt down on the ground.

He looked at me with impatience and anger in his eyes.

I was angry too. "Lucas, you still won't tell the truth. I can smell Ruby's perfume on you. I smelled it."

I wanted to cry, but I couldn't.

I didn't want to shed tears in front of Lucas.

Lucas was stunned for a few seconds, a flash of guilt crossing his eyes. "We all live in the same house. We're bound to run into each other. Of course I might accidentally pick up her scent. Stop being so suspicious."

I smiled bitterly and said, "Then why don't I smell like her?"

Lucas stood up, clearly exasperated. "Mia, can you stop making a fuss? What exactly do you want? Why won't you believe anything I say? You used to believe everything I said. What's wrong with you?"

I thought I wouldn't cry, but tears started falling uncontrollably.

I choked out, "I just saw a man in Ruby's room earlier. His back looked a lot like yours. Was that man you?"
