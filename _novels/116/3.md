As soon as I finished speaking, Lucas hugged me tightly. He whispered in my ear, "It wasn't me. That was a man Mom found for Ruby. Mia, you have to believe me."

I pushed Lucas away and looked into his eyes, saying, "Don't lie to me!"

Lucas panicked and hurriedly said, "I'm not lying to you. It really was a man Mom found for Ruby. When Ruby gets pregnant and gives birth, they'll say it's my brother's posthumous child. You can't tell anyone about this."

Seeing that I didn't respond, Lucas picked me up in his arms. "Mia, it's too cold outside. Let's talk inside."

Lucas held me tightly and carried me into the house.

He threw me onto the bed and looked into my eyes, saying, "Mia, I swear, I will only love you in this lifetime. I will never betray you. You have to believe me."

Lucas's words now were exactly the same as what he had said on our wedding day.

On our wedding day, I thought his scent was sweet, and I wanted to hold him close and breathe it in.

But now, his scent had changed. It had become a smell I didn't like.

After saying this, Lucas tried to kiss me.

But my body instinctively resisted.

In the past, I would have leaned in, but today I couldn't do it.

I turned my head away. Lucas thought I was still upset and smiled foolishly, saying, "Mia, let me comfort you to sleep. Early to bed, early to rise. You're getting dark circles under your eyes."

Lucas held me in his arms, trying to comfort me to sleep as he usually did, telling me a bedtime story.

But I had no interest in listening to stories.

The smell on him was too unpleasant.

It made me uncomfortable, even nauseous.

I forced myself to accept Lucas, but I couldn't accept the smell on him.

I instinctively turned away, facing away from Lucas.

Without Lucas near me, the air felt fresh.

It smelled comfortable.

Lucas said, "Mia, drink some water before you sleep."

I nodded and drank the water.

After drinking, I suddenly felt very tired and sleepy.

My eyelids were heavy, and I couldn't keep them open.

I quickly fell asleep.

I was awakened by the sound of heavy breathing.

I opened my eyes to find myself alone in bed.

Lucas was gone.

I heard the breathing sounds coming from upstairs again.

Upstairs was Ruby's room.

I had a bad feeling.

I opened the window and looked out into the courtyard.

Lucas wasn't in the courtyard.

Where had he gone so late at night?

I carefully went up to the second floor.

I stopped outside Ruby's room.

The door was still slightly ajar.

Through the gap, I saw Ruby entangled with a man.

The man was still facing away from me.

Ruby giggled and said, "Brother-in-law, how many sleeping pills did you give her? Will your wife suddenly wake up?"

"I gave her three pills. She won't wake up." Hearing the man's voice, my tears instantly fell.

This voice was too familiar. It was Lucas.

The man who had just been comforting me to sleep was now entangled with another woman.

What an ironic scene.

I thought I had found true love, a love that would last a lifetime.

But in the end, I had misjudged him.

My love couldn't tolerate even a grain of sand. I didn't want this marriage anymore.

I carefully went downstairs, picked up my phone, and dialed my brother's number.

"Brother, I want a divorce."

There was silence on the phone for a few seconds, then my brother laughed and said, "My dear sister, I told you long ago that in our wealthy circles, there are no truly devoted people. A lifelong, monogamous relationship is impossible. Come to France. The estate and handsome men are all ready for you."
