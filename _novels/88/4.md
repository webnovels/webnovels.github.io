After escaping from the tomb, my dad cried and slapped me hard.

"You little jinx, why didn't you go when your mom called you?"

"Your brother sacrificed himself for you."

"Why couldn't it have been you who died?" My dad's eyes were full of hatred as he looked at me.

I just stood there expressionlessly, looking at him.

"Dad, my brother didn't sacrifice himself for me. He sacrificed himself for our whole family."

"If you really feel sorry for him, why didn't you stop him and take his place as the vampire's groom?" I stared straight at my dad and asked.

My dad's face immediately showed embarrassment and anger.

"You little bastard, are you cursing me to die?"

"Besides, I'm already married. How could I be some vampire's groom?"

Mom impatiently looked at us at this point.

"Alright, stop arguing. While the positive energy is still strong, let's hurry home." Mom urged irritably.

Seeing Mom angry, Dad didn't dare say anything more.

It wasn't until we got home that Mom collapsed into a chair, letting out a long sigh of relief.

Then she instructed us, "If anyone asks in the future, just say Ryan eloped with his girlfriend, understand?"

We all nodded quickly.

Dad glared at me again at this point, "What are you standing around for? Go boil some mugwort water for your mom and sister to bathe in and get rid of the bad energy!"

I silently turned and walked towards the kitchen.

As I boiled the water, I was thinking about how to deal with that vampire.

In my past life, I lived with that vampire for three years.

Her powers were extremely high, but she was still afraid of light and only dared to go out on rainy days.

During the day, she usually cultivated in places with extremely heavy negative energy.

At night, she would pull me into the coffin to absorb the positive energy from my body.

But before I was killed by my brother's bomb, she had tried to reach out her hand under the morning sun.

So I had a feeling that if that vampire queen was allowed to continue cultivating, she would eventually become an even more terrifying monster.

By then, it was uncertain if anyone could deal with her.

So I had to quickly spread the news of the vampire queen's appearance.

But what I never expected was that the vampire queen would appear at my house that very night.
