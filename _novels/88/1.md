After being killed by my brother's homemade bomb, I was reborn.

I woke up on the day my family pushed me out to be the vampire's groom.

My mom is an amateur archaeologist with questionable ethics.

In my previous life, she had found a tomb, but it was surrounded by such strong negative energy that she didn't dare to dig it up normally.

The summer solstice is the day with the strongest positive energy of the year, which can counteract the negative energy.

So on the summer solstice, my mom took our whole family to dig up the grave.

But what we didn't expect was that after we finally dug our way in, there was only a coffin inside.

My sister Emily saw it and got excited.

"Mom, this coffin is made of nanmu wood! There must be valuable burial objects inside!"

Nanmu wood was something only the nobility could afford in ancient times.

It was clear that the tomb's owner must have been a wealthy person.

My mom nodded in agreement.

She wouldn't let us men touch it, saying our energy might disturb things. So she and Emily worked together to lift the coffin lid.

But when they opened the coffin, there were no burial objects. Instead, there was a beautiful female vampire dressed in ancient royal robes.

My mom was stunned.

Then, before the vampire queen woke up, she whispered harshly, "Jack, come here quickly."

Before I could react, my brother Ryan pushed me in front of my mom.

Mom cut my palm with a knife and shoved me into the coffin.

"Your Highness, we didn't mean to disturb your peace. This boy has a pure yang constitution. We offer him to you as an apology."

Then they hurriedly closed the coffin lid.

I begged them desperately to let me out.

But the thousand-year-old vampire queen on top of me woke up at that moment.

She grabbed my wrist tightly, trapping me.

I was so scared I stopped breathing.

The next moment, a cold breath brushed against my neck.

"Are you my groom?" Her voice was unexpectedly cold and pleasant.

I lay there trembling, my teeth chattering in fear. "N-no... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to intrude into your coffin."

"Can you please let me out?"

But she just chuckled and stroked my face.

"Your blood has already formed a contract with me. From now on, you belong to me."

Then she extended her cold fingertip and slowly traced my Adam's apple.

I felt like a snake was staring at me, ready to strike.

When dawn came, she finally released me.

Licking her crimson lips, she commented, "Pure yang blood is indeed nourishing."

After that, I became her tool for absorbing positive energy.

At night, I had to sleep with her in the coffin, letting her feed on me. During the day, I had to fend for myself to avoid starving to death.

Fortunately, when she learned I had no money, she voluntarily took some valuable burial objects from the tomb and gave them to me to sell.

It was when my brother caught me exchanging antiques for money that he stopped me.

After learning that all the antiques in my possession were provided by the vampire queen, he forced me to ask for more antiques from her for him.

When I refused, he followed me to the tomb and killed me with a homemade bomb.

What he didn't know was that even if he hadn't acted, I wouldn't have lived much longer.

The vampire queen was an evil creature. My energy had been nearly depleted from her constant feeding day and night.

It's not that I hadn't thought about escaping, but she had placed a curse on me. No matter where I ran, she could always drag me back.

Living again, watching my brother eagerly volunteer to take my place...

I couldn't help but laugh coldly.

Did he really think being the vampire's groom was some cushy job?
