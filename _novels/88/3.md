I was the unexpected second child in the family, so I was never favored by my family members since childhood.

When I was born, my grandfather had originally planned to drown me in the pigsty.

But my mom, being an amateur archaeologist, was already doing things that could bring bad karma.

She was worried that if my grandfather drowned me, it would affect the fortune of her descendants.

So she stopped my grandfather.

The result was that although I survived, I grew up unloved by my parents.

Add to that, I wasn't as good at sweet-talking and pleasing people as my brother, and I couldn't produce results no matter how hard I was pushed.

So my parents liked me even less.

As far back as I can remember, all the household chores like washing clothes, cooking, feeding pigs and chickens were done by me.

To them, I was just a workhorse they could sacrifice at any time.

Mom used to often tell me that if it weren't for her soft-heartedness, I would have been drowned by my grandfather on the day I was born.

Because of her words, I had always been grateful to her.

But it wasn't until she instinctively sacrificed me first when danger came that I realized she had never cared about me at all.

And even if I really owed her anything, in my past life, I had already repaid it.

In this life, I just want to live for myself.
