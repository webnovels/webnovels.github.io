My husband's first love got engaged.

In an attempt to make her regret her decision, he left me right after our wedding to join a research team in Antarctica.

Despite visiting him 66 times, my efforts were in vain. Five years later, I stopped going. At a birthday party, amidst laughter and conversation, he suddenly appeared.

Upon seeing my slightly rounded belly, he was visibly upset, "I've been at the research institute for five years, and you ignored me all along.

Whose child is in your belly?" I replied calmly, "It's none of your business.

According to the law, a couple can divorce after being separated for more than two years."
