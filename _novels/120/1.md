Six months after my stepmom moved in, all of my mom's belongings suddenly vanished.

I approached my stepmom, but before I could ask anything, she cried out, "Hazel, stop!" and collapsed, screaming.

The door clicked open at that moment.

I looked up and met my dad's shocked eyes.

My stepmom lay on the floor, clutching her pregnant belly with one hand and grabbing me with the other, crying desperately.

"Hazel, wait until I give birth. You can do whatever you want to me, but please, spare the child inside me! He's your dear brother! I'm begging you..."

Her voice grew weaker, and a chill ran through my heart.

"What are you talking about? I didn't even touch you! It was you who..."

"Hazel Bennett!"

My dad's shout interrupted me.

He rushed over, picked up my sweating stepmom, and looked at me, gritting his teeth.

"Last night, your aunt offered to organize your mom's belongings so you could keep them safe. I agreed, but now..."

He held my stepmom and walked out, instructing the nanny, "Chris! Throw away all of the previous Mrs. Bennett's belongings! Don't keep a single thing!"

My mind was in turmoil as I lunged forward, pleading, "Dad, don't! Don't throw away mom's things, they're all I have left!"

He turned to look at me.

"Just because you have a heart condition, your stepmom has been extremely patient and careful with you, even while pregnant."

"And you?"

"It's because your mom didn't raise you well that you're so ungrateful and repay kindness with resentment!"

Seeing me clutching my chest, struggling to breathe, he coldly said, "If this happens again, you'll have to move out!"

Dad hurried away, carrying my stepmom.

I stood frozen, unable to move.

What did I just hear?

Dad wants to kick me out?

He even said I'm ungrateful and repay kindness with resentment?

I shivered with fear, suddenly lifting my head to watch their retreating figures.

And as I looked up, I saw my stepmom's face turn back.

She leaned on my dad's shoulder, moaning in pain, but her face showed a secretive, happy smile, mouthing the words to me: "Poor little wretch."
