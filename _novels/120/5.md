On the day my stepmom returned arrogantly with the little brat, I "coincidentally" got bullied by some mean girls at the school gate.

I twisted my ankle when I fell, was covered in bruises, and couldn't walk.

What to do?

Call my brother.

Seeing my sorry state made him furious. He asked who did it, but I wouldn’t say. So, he carried me to the hospital.

After a series of checks, medication, and ice packs, it was quite late.

When we got out of the car at the residential area gate, I wanted to hop back home myself. But Asher scolded me, so I let him carry me.

As we got closer to home, I pretended to be "nervous."

"What if my aunt gets upset seeing you carrying me?"

"Why would she? What do you think my mom is like?"

Asher laughed, "You just don't know her, that's why you're scared. She's actually very simple and kind."

I felt a bit queasy but held onto his neck tighter, nuzzling his shoulder affectionately.

"I trust you, brother."

A few minutes later.

In the villa living room.

Asher carried me into my stepmom's sight.

The table full of dishes had long gone cold.

Stepmom sat in front of the empty table, staring at our close figures in disbelief, her expression almost terrifying.

Asher paused, "What's going on?"

"Don't you know tonight is your brother's one-month celebration?"

Stepmom's voice was extremely strained, like a string about to snap.

"I waited for you for three hours. Why are you back so late?"

Asher frowned, "Waiting for me? You should've eaten. Hazel sprained her ankle today, so I took her to the hospital for a check-up. Thankfully, there was no fracture... I need to find out who pushed her when I go to school tomorrow..."

Adding fuel to the fire.

As I almost laughed out loud, stepmom finally slammed the table, nearly shouting, "Today is your brother's one-month celebration! Your own brother!!!"

The baby in the crib was startled and started crying.

But Asher frowned, "Mom, what do you mean? Of course, Guoguo is my brother, but Hazel is also my sister. Her injury is obviously more important than some inconsequential one-month celebration."

I laughed heartily inside.

Stepmom shook with anger, pointing at him, "Inconsequential? Are you out of your mind? Can't even tell who's close or distant..."

She glared at me with red eyes, and I quickly hid my hand on Asher's shoulder in a panic.

The light from the watch flickered briefly.

Stepmom's expression froze as she sharply said, "What is that?!"

I 'trembled slightly' on Asher's back, not daring to speak.

Stepmom stormed over, ignoring Asher's retreat, aggressively grabbing my hand.

The delicately beautiful watch appeared in front of her eyes, but the next second, Asher turned around and dodged.

"Mom! What are you doing? I bought the watch for Hazel!"

"You bought her a watch? You only gave your brother a silver bracelet worth a few hundred bucks since he was born, but you bought her a watch worth tens of thousands?!"

Stepmom's eyes were red, and she screamed, "Asher, are you crazy?!"

I curled up on Asher's back, trembling, but I was smiling inside.

Asher was tense and about to speak when footsteps suddenly echoed from upstairs.

It was my dad coming down.

The conflict abruptly ceased.
