The day I returned from the refugee camp in Africa, my husband Asher's mistress, Adeline, discovered she was pregnant. This happened because my mother, who suffers from dementia, ruined their celebration cake. In retaliation, Asher sent her to Adeline's Unregulated Women's Etiquette Camp, where she was mistreated, starved, deprived of a bed, and contracted a rare, deadly virus. I knelt in front of him, begging, "Please, I’m pleading with you. My mother has contracted a virus and needs urgent medical attention."

Without even looking up, Asher responded indifferently, "She drugged my father and caused my mother’s death. Sending her to the camp is just a way for her to learn some new skills."

"You don't have to use her illness to gain sympathy. I know more about the camp than you do."

To save my mother, I was forced to wear revealing clothing and beg on the streets. People laughed and tore at my clothes, mocking, "Mr. Asher must be generous, letting his woman be played with by his friends."

Asher laughed with his mistress, "She's just an old shoe. Who knows how many gang leaders have been with her? She's filthy."

Eventually, I decided to fake my death and pursue my dreams elsewhere. Asher went mad, searching the world for any trace of me.
