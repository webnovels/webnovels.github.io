BFF got pregnant before marriage, so I kindly let her stay at my house.

Then I discovered the baby she was carrying belonged to my husband, who is a mama's boy.

My mother-in-law, who favors sons, belittled me, claiming I was useless compared to my BFF, and even likened me to something worse than a female dog.

The day after I refused to divorce, the Ice Age Apocalypse struck.

They threw me out, watching as I froze to death, becoming an ice sculpture.

But fate gave me another chance and granted me a wish.

"I just wish my BFF a prosperous pregnancy with six children."
