The light from Gabriel's phone screen scattered in the bedroom as he watched a woman giving an acceptance speech.

His gaze held an adoration he hadn't even noticed himself.

I turned over, catching a glimpse of the familiar necklace around her neck on the screen.

It was the diamond necklace passed down through generations in my family, the proof of love I had once given to Gabriel with my own hands.

Now, it was once again adorning another woman's neck.

Gabriel turned off the screen, his voice low and gentle:

"Did I wake you?"

I shook my head, pulling the covers down to bury my face further.

Gabriel gently patted my back, a tender smile on his lips:

"Go back to sleep, I'm here with you."

I knew his momentary tenderness wasn't for me, just a lingering effect from earlier.

He hated me. He hated that I had saved him, leaving behind a scarred, overmedicated version of myself with a changed figure.

No matter how hard he tried to hide it, he couldn't mask the disgust in his eyes when he looked at me.

My hand touched the scars on my cheek.

Burned by the fierce fire, uneven scars were etched into my skin.

A bitter smile flickered across my numb heart.

This was the seventh time. I was all too familiar with this routine.

The unfamiliar perfume, the sudden departures in the middle of the night...

In my hazy state, he removed his hand from my back and quietly left the bedroom.

Standing on the balcony, he made a call.

A clear, lively voice came through the phone, piercing my ears:

"Gabriel, did you see my award ceremony?"

He chuckled softly, his voice full of affection:

"I did. That necklace suits you well."

His gentle laughter was like a thorny rose vine, strangling my heart while its thorns pierced deep.

Soft laughter echoed from the other end of the line as well.

It turns out that this kind of pain, even after experiencing it so many times, doesn't completely numb you. It still stings.

By the time the pillow had lost its warmth, he finally bid Tessa goodnight, reluctantly.

His hand, chilled by the night breeze, brushed my hair aside.

He lay back down, holding me a bit tighter than before.

I heard him murmuring:

"Aria, I love you so much, so so much..."

The love he professed over and over didn't seem directed at me.

It was as if he was weaving a cage to trap my heart, stripping away my last shred of dignity and self-respect.

I slowly opened my eyes:

"I love you too, very very much."

But I want to give up now.

Gabriel smiled and lowered his head slightly, holding me tighter.

I heard my own voice, tired and hoarse:

"Gabriel, can I have a goodnight kiss?"

Even though I knew it was too much to ask, I still couldn't help but clutch his collar in the darkness.

If only Gabriel would give me just one kiss, I'd be willing to wait for him one more time.

Even if I knew it was fake, even if, even if a kiss didn't mean anything.

But please, Gabriel.

Don't let my heart die so quickly.

Gabriel just smiled and let go of me, ruffling my hair:

"I have to go to the office for some overtime work. Wait for me to come back, okay?"

My fingers, which had been gripping his collar, loosened helplessly. In the darkness, he couldn't see my tears.

I listened to the door close and the car start up and drive away downstairs.

Gabriel, I think I can't find a reason to keep loving you anymore.

I'm too tired.
