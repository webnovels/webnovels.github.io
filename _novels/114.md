I noticed something strange about my wife sleeping next to me. She was unresponsive to my intimate gestures, like a dead fish.

I thought maybe after years of marriage, she had lost her passion and excitement for me.

That is, until I overheard my wife talking to her hot best friend: "My husband sleeps like the dead every night. You could put a corpse next to him and he wouldn't even notice!"

So my wife found a body double?
