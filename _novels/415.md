When I gave up my law license, the legal community rejoiced. Only Rachel Wilson, my fiancé's ex-girlfriend and the star prosecutor, strongly objected. At the press conference, she tearfully pleaded: "Jennifer is one of the most promising young lawyers I've ever seen. I sincerely hope she can return to the courtroom." I blocked her number and boarded the plane, feeling nothing. In my previous life, I defended a death row inmate. Internet users called me an accomplice, cursing my whole family to hell. The key evidence I submitted in court mysteriously failed. Rachel Wilson won the case. All of this turned me from a golden girl of an elite law school to a despised "murderer's lawyer" that everyone wanted to beat up. Internet users sent me razor blades and dumped feces at my door. My grandparents who raised me were surrounded and insulted by angry netizens, dying from sudden illness. I fell into severe depression. On the day Rachel Wilson won a lifetime achievement award and kissed Ethan Cole, I hanged myself in the law firm building. When I opened my eyes again, I had returned to the day the case was submitted.
