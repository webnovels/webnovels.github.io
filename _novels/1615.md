The day my company went public, I got proof my fiancée was cheating.
A picture of her making out with a security guard in the parking lot.
Then I saw her latest Ins post:【Simple days are the best kind of happy.】
Attached was a photo: The security guard gently caressing her swollen belly in a hospital maternity ward.
I glanced at the ring on my desk, the one I'd planned to propose with. 
I casually tossed it into my pocket.
Chloe, if a simple, ordinary life is what you crave, then by all means, have it. 
My lavish love? You forfeited that privilege.

I called the hotel and the wedding planner to cancel everything, then finally, the bank.
"Freeze all bank accounts and credit cards under Chloe's name."
Just as I hung up, Chloe pushed open my office door and walked in.
"Honey, I just heard you say 'freeze bank accounts.' Whose accounts are you freezing?"
I shrugged off her question with a vague excuse, my gaze shifting to Mike, the security guard standing behind her.
"Aren't you going to introduce us?"
Chloe immediately forgot her earlier question, pulling Mike's hand and beaming happily.
"Honey, this is Mike. He's a security guard downstairs in the parking lot."
"Mr. Anderson, it's a pleasure!"
Mike flashed a shy smile.
My eyes burned, watching Chloe still clinging to Mike's hand, refusing to let go.
I'd loved Chloe for ten years, pampered her for ten years. To ensure her happiness, I built this empire from nothing, fought tooth and nail through cutthroat business deals, nearly lost everything, even my life, several times over.
And all that? It meant less than some run-of-the-mill security guard. The irony was a bitter pill.
"Honey, Mike's talking to you," Chloe reminded me, a hint of annoyance in her voice.
I shot her a glance, then calmly stated, "If he's a parking lot security guard, and it's work hours, why isn't he down there? What's he doing here?"
Chloe quickly interjected, "I brought him! Mike's just been unlucky, held back by circumstances, forced into security. But I know his capabilities. Doesn't the company still need a Business Development Manager? I think he'd be perfect for it."
I almost laughed, but it was a bitter, angry sound. She's trying to get her lover a job here? Chloe, this isn't your personal love nest; it's a multi-million dollar corporation.
I once told Chloe that if she ever betrayed me, I'd take everything back. I could elevate her to the highest heights, or plunge her into the lowest depths. Before I could speak, Mike eagerly said, "Please don't worry, Mr. Anderson! I'll absolutely fulfill the duties of a Business Development Manager, handle every task, and make this department the top one in the company!"
Chloe smiled gently. "Mike, I know you can do it."
You believe him?
I took a sip of my tea, then calmly spoke. "I don't recall agreeing to make him Business Development Manager."
Chloe's face stiffened. She turned to me, "Honey, Mike is the most suitable person. It'll be the company's loss if you don't hire him. Have you heard some rumors? They're all lies! I brought Mike here for the company's growth. You need to think about the bigger picture."
I need to think about the bigger picture? So, I should just hand over the Business Development Manager position to your lover, turning my company into your little hideaway?
My face went cold. "The company has strict hiring policies. It's not just a matter of you saying someone is 'suitable.'"
Chloe was clearly displeased. "What policies? You're the boss, Liam, your word is law here."
"Chloe, Mr. Anderson has a point," Mike interjected, trying to play the good guy. He then turned to me, "Mr. Anderson, you've misunderstood Chloe. Honestly, I'm quite happy as a security guard. Chloe just couldn't bear to see my potential wasted, and she insisted I come."
I nodded directly. "If you're happy, keep doing it. You only get what you're capable of. Taking shortcuts to the top might seem easy, but it's also a quick way to crash and burn."
Mike's face darkened for a split second, then he meekly replied, "Mr. Anderson, your words are a valuable lesson."
"Enough!"
Chloe snapped, furious.
"Liam Anderson, when did you become so passive-aggressive? If you're not going to hire him, fine, but why humiliate him? This side of you... I hate it!"
Mike chimed in again, feigning innocence. "Chloe, you shouldn't argue with Mr. Anderson because of me. It's all my fault."
He then looked at me, a look of utter grievance on his face.
"Mr. Anderson, you truly misunderstand me. I never wanted to climb the ladder overnight; I just wanted to prove myself."
