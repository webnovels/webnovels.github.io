Three years into our marriage, my wife, Scarlett, had conned me into donating blood 47 times. Meanwhile, she was getting intimate with Jax, her gym trainer.

"Every time I see that look on his face, so willing to donate blood to save someone, I just find it hilarious," Scarlett scoffed, catching her breath.

"Come on, don't say that. Our dear Leo is such a saint. He genuinely believes his blood is saving lives, all for those 'patients' you've made up."

Jax chuckled, gently holding her waist.

I watched through the crack in the door, my blood freezing instantly.

"We'll need another batch of blood next month. We can raise the price again this time; Leo's blood type is so rare after all."

Scarlett adjusted her position and kissed him.

My hands clenched into fists, nails digging into my palms.

Through the door crack, I saw her sitting on the office desk, her legs wrapped around the young man's waist, locked in a fervent kiss.

"$70,000 a bag, that's indeed a good price," Jax replied, satisfied.

My fists tightened, the blood in my veins felt like it was burning.
