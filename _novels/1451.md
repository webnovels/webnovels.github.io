After Jason lost his memory in a car crash, he forgot our ten years of love.

He was welcomed back by his powerful birth family, matched with a perfect fiancée, and I became the gold-digging stranger clinging to his past.

My flower shop was destroyed. He watched coldly as his fiancée pushed me to the floor.

The child in my womb became a pool of blood. He only wrinkled his nose in disgust.

"A gold-digger's daughter, daring to dream above your station."

When fire trapped us both, he rushed to his fiancée without hesitation.

As flames burned my skin, I heard his final dismissive words.

"Amber, I never lost my memory. You owed me this."

"If there's a next life, I hope we never meet."

In the darkness, I heard a sterile, mechanical voice.

"Jason Thompson has traded his life for your rebirth."

I opened my eyes again. I found myself back to the day he woke up from the car crash, his memory gone.

This time, I didn't cry. I didn't try to prove I was his girlfriend.

Instead, I offered a calm smile. "Mr. Thompson. I am Amber Reed, your patron."
