It was late when I finally got home. My parents and sister were at the dining table having dinner, and Jasper was present as well. I headed straight to my room to treat my wound. By the time I was done, my parents had already left the table.

Jasper was on the couch in the living room, absorbed in his phone. Only Nora remained, with a mischievous grin on her face.

"Sis, come eat! We saved some food for you. If you wait any longer, it'll get cold and not taste as good!"

With that, she pushed a large plate of meat toward me. I picked up a piece and took a bite. The taste was odd; I couldn't determine what kind of meat it was.

Noticing the sinister smile in Nora's eyes, realization hit me like a flash.

"Whiskers! Whiskers!" Normally, Whiskers would be at my side as soon as I got home, but today, there was no sign of the cat. I began searching frantically for Whiskers.

Nora chuckled and pointed at the meat in front of me.

"Don't bother looking, sis. Isn't your Whiskers right there in front of you?"

A wave of darkness washed over me. I stuck my fingers down my throat and vomited.

"Oh dear sister, I'm just sad you're heading abroad. The food there won't match up to home-cooked meals. Anyway, that animal was of no use. I personally cooked this tasty meal for you to remind you of home."

Her laughter echoed with triumph as she took the plate of meat.

I clenched my teeth, and after a moment, my anger burst forth. I punched Nora.

"Nora! Why? I've given you everything, so why do this to me? What did Whiskers ever do to you?"

Nora held her face, screaming hysterically.

"How dare you ask why? Don't think I don't know that in our past life, Mom and Dad favored you and made sure I was sent abroad."

"Do you have any idea how much I suffered in my previous life? A vagrant followed me home and abused me day and night."

"I had to serve him just to survive. And you? You were living comfortably back home!"

"Sis, it's your turn this time to endure everything. I want you to feel the pain I went through and ruin everything you have."

I was in disbelief, shaking my head with difficulty holding back my emotions.

"So... you've been reborn too. Then you must know how Jasper tormented me in our past life and how I died."

"I didn't know you would face such things abroad. If I had known, I wouldn't have let you go. Tell me, what did you say to Jasper back then?"

I clutched my heart in agony, while Nora's smile twisted grotesquely.

"Stop pretending to be a saint, Cora. Your hypocrisy makes me sick."

"As for what I said, finish the dinner I made for you, and I'll tell you."

She picked up the steaming plate of meat and approached me. She glanced at Jasper in the living room, her eyes gleaming with calculation, and let out a wicked laugh.

Suddenly, she staggered backward, and the plate of meat spilled onto her, scalding her skin red.

As I stood there in shock, Jasper rushed over, slapping me twice before kicking me to the ground.

My ears rang, and my cheeks swelled rapidly. Jasper didn't waste time scolding me; he just picked up Nora and ran cold water over her arms to soothe the burns.

Nora whimpered and cried, while Jasper gently comforted her.

I lay on the ground, unable to hear anything.

After tending to Nora, Jasper walked over to me, grabbed me by the hair, and slapped me repeatedly like a madman.

I was in so much pain I nearly passed out, unable to fight back. All I saw when I closed my eyes was Jasper's ruthless demeanor before my death in our past life.

Maybe it would be better to just die.

Jasper seemed to tire of hitting me and tossed me aside, panting heavily.

"Let me warn you again: don't make me kill you a second time. Otherwise, I'll make sure you can't live or die!"
