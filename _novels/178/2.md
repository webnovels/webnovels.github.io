Mom and Dad were always like this, unconditionally supporting their daughter.

I knew that because I was more obedient and sensible than Nora, they favored me.

In the previous life, they knew I admired Jasper for a long time and deliberately let me stay in the country to marry him.

I went to the mall near home to buy some things I’d need abroad.

I happened to run into Jasper and Nora picking out a wedding dress.

Nora excitedly compared the most expensive wedding dress against herself.

In the previous life, I also wanted this wedding dress, but Jasper refused.

"Cora, I want something low-key. This dress is too flashy, and it’s only worn once, there’s no need."

Now, he bought that wedding dress without hesitation.

Turns out the difference between love and not loving is this obvious!

I was about to turn to leave when Nora’s sharp eyes caught sight of me, and she called out.

"Sis, you’re here at the mall too!"

She walked towards me holding Jasper’s hand, her face brimming with happiness.

"Our wedding is set for three days from now. The master said it's a lucky day. Sis, you must come to our wedding! Without your blessing, my wedding wouldn’t be perfect."

"I have to pack for my trip abroad, my flight is booked for tomorrow. I’m afraid..."

"Since Nora asked, you better be there on time."

"I know you’re also reborn. If you’re not there that day, I’ll kill Whiskers. Make it suffer the same fate as you did in your past life."

Jasper leaned in, threatening me harshly in my ear.

My body shuddered.

Whiskers is my little cat, a gift from Aunt Genevieve before she passed away.

Back then, Mom and Dad were always busy with work, while Aunt Genevieve pampered me like her own daughter.

After Aunt Genevieve’s death, I often held Whiskers and secretly missed her.

Filled with resentment, I nodded. As I turned to leave, Nora grabbed my hand.

"Sis, since I’m the daughter-in-law of the Jiang family, the jade pendant around your neck..."

It was the last keepsake Aunt Genevieve gave me before she passed, acknowledging me as her goddaughter, and she personally put it on me for protection.

Nora smiled slyly at the jade on my neck.

I glared, "This was a gift from Aunt Genevieve, not a Jiang family heirloom, there’s no need..."

"Nora, I can buy you ten or eight of such jade pendants, no need for this one. I have plenty at home."

Jasper replied softly to Nora.

"Sis, Aunt Genevieve’s jade pendant was meant for her daughter-in-law. Are you mad at me for taking Jasper? I’m sorry, sis."

Nora’s eyes immediately filled with tears, and she looked pitifully wronged.

Jasper by her side immediately frowned with concern, patting Nora’s head.

"My mom’s jade pendant is for my future wife. Take it off!"

Facing Jasper’s fierce gaze, memories of him forcing me to kneel and apologize flashed back. The shadows of the past haunted me, I didn’t dare refuse him.

I could only shakily remove the pendant and hand it to Nora.

A sly glint passed through her eyes, and as she took the pendant, she suddenly let it slip. I instinctively tried to catch it, but it shattered on the ground.

The pendant broke into pieces, and I couldn’t help but squat down, sobbing quietly.

Nora pouted in a tea-like manner,

"Sis, I know you hate me. If you really want to marry Jasper, I can go abroad instead. For the family business and your love, I can give up everything here!"

"But... but why did you break the pendant? It was Aunt Genevieve’s keepsake! It’s Jasper’s only memory of her!"

She loudly lamented her grievance, attracting the attention of passersby, and soon we were surrounded by a crowd.

"This woman is so vile, breaking the pendant and trying to steal her sister’s fiancé, shameless."

"Someone like her should be executed, all her education wasted."

"Exactly, people like her pollute the air just by living. That was a keepsake!"

"Eyeing her sister’s husband is a disgrace to women."

The piercing curses and mockery from the crowd reached me, and I silently picked up the pendant pieces with a handkerchief.

I caught a glimpse of Nora’s smug smile towards me.

Jasper, with a sullen face, approached and leaned down, giving me a hard slap.

He gripped my chin, warning me. "Don’t try any tricks again, haven’t given up yet, Cora? Still want to taste being beaten and humiliated to death?"

Jasper shoved me aside, holding Nora as they left.

I covered my swollen face, clutching the broken pieces of the pendant tightly until my hand began to bleed, staining the handkerchief with bright red blood.

I carefully wrapped the pieces, whispering to myself.

"Sorry, Aunt Genevieve, I broke my promise."
