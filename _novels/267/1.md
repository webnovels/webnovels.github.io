They’d been married for eight years, but Eleanor still faced constant criticism from Julian's family elders for not having children. Julian's grandma, in particular, had tried to force him to divorce and remarry countless times. He stood his ground, defying her and enduring her wrath, even when it meant pushing himself to the brink of collapse. He wouldn't give in.

“Eleanor, she’s the only one for me, this lifetime.”

Then, Julian’s grandma brought a girl from her hometown and practically shoved her at Julian.

Her name was Brooke. With her ruddy cheeks and a thick country accent, she looked completely out of place.

Julian’s disdain for her was obvious. “She’s a complete country bumpkin, not even worthy of a single strand of Eleanor’s hair.”

Eleanor never even bothered to look at her. How could some naive country girl ever compare to a sophisticated heiress like her?

Until two months later, Eleanor overheard the house staff gossiping:

“That country girl has some tricks up her sleeve. She’s pregnant already! Julian’s grandma must be relieved now, right?”

“It’s strange, though. She got pregnant on the first try.”

“Mr. Julian never even looked at her properly. That little sparrow really hit the jackpot, didn’t she? From rags to riches, just like that.”

**Chapter 1**

Eleanor’s nails dug into her palms as she clenched her fists, her mind a blank.

When she suggested divorce, Julian had knelt in the pouring rain for a full day and night.

He’d said, “Eleanor, I’m so sorry. I was drunk that night, I mistook her for you…”

“Don’t worry, I’ll send her away immediately!”

Eleanor looked at him, shivering, his lips blue from the cold. Her heart softened.

But six months later, Eleanor saw him at the hospital, accompanying Brooke for a prenatal check-up.

Julian’s eyes were red as he explained, “Grandma found out she was pregnant and threatened to take her own life. I had no choice but to hide her in the suburban villa.”

“As soon as she has the baby, I’ll give it to Grandma and be done with it. It won’t affect our lives, I promise.”

She gave him another chance.

Until three days ago, ruthless kidnappers mistakenly identified Brooke as Eleanor and snatched her.

Julian, who always claimed he didn’t care about Brooke, panicked the moment he received the kidnappers’ call.

“Any amount of money! Just don’t hurt Brooke!”

But what the kidnappers wanted wasn’t money. It was “Mrs. Julian’s” life.

Julian’s eyes were bloodshot as he grabbed Eleanor’s shoulders, begging.

“Eleanor, please, you go rescue Brooke. She’s timid and pregnant, I’m scared… I promise I’ll come save you as soon as she’s safe, okay?”

Eleanor snapped back to reality. His address for Brooke had changed from "country bumpkin" to "Brooke" and now "Brookie." Without realizing it, Brooke had carved out a place in Julian's heart.

Eleanor gave a bitter laugh. “What if I don’t go?”

A cold glint flashed in Julian’s eyes. “Eleanor, Brooke is carrying the heir to the Julian family. This would be your contribution to our family legacy.”

“Don’t worry, I promise I’ll save you.”

She sniffled, her voice trembling and breaking in two.

“What if… I don’t make it back?”

Julian frowned. “Eleanor! Lives are at stake! Can’t you be more understanding?”

Watching his resolute expression, her heart shattered into a million pieces.

Eleanor closed her eyes in despair the moment Julian pushed her towards the kidnappers.

At the same time, Brooke, clutching her belly, lunged towards Julian.

“Brooke!” Julian’s expression changed instantly, his voice laced with a tremor.

“It’s good you’re safe…”

She leaned weakly into Julian’s embrace, reaching out. “I’m so scared I won’t be able to keep your baby…”

Julian’s eyes reddened instantly. He scooped her up and rushed out.

“I won’t let anything happen to you! I absolutely won’t!”

He ran so fast, he didn’t even glance at Eleanor, who was being shoved by the kidnappers.

She stumbled and fell onto the hard concrete ground, but felt no pain.

In a daze, she remembered the day Julian confessed his love to her.

He’d held her close, repeating, “Eleanor, in this life, I’ll never let anyone hurt you.”

Now, thinking back, how ridiculous it all seemed.

Eleanor was bound at the feet and thrown into the ocean. As she sank deeper and deeper, she gradually lost consciousness.

**Chapter 2**

When Eleanor woke up, she saw Julian by her side.

“Eleanor, you’re finally awake!”

She thought he was relieved by her safe return, but his next sentence was:

“Now Brooke can rest easy. You don’t know how guilty she felt.”

…

Eleanor pulled her hand away. “Guilty? I’m sure that’s not the only thing she should feel guilty about, is it? Like climbing into the master’s bed and getting pre—”

Julian’s face instantly darkened. “Didn’t we agree not to bring that up again? I explained why we kept the baby.”

Meeting her gaze, Julian softened his tone. “Brooke kept saying she wanted to apologize to you in person, but I made her keep it a secret. I was afraid you’d leave me if you found out.”

Eleanor: ???

“Besides, you’re back safe and sound now. Do you really have to dwell on this?”

Eleanor paused, then said with a hint of sarcasm,

“Have you ever thought that if the kidnappers hadn’t chosen to drown me, but to use a knife, I might already be dead?”

Julian scowled and clicked his tongue.

Brooke suddenly rushed in, kneeling at Eleanor’s bedside, sobbing.

“It’s all my fault… I shouldn’t have brought Mr. Julian hangover soup when he was drunk, and I definitely shouldn’t have kept his baby!”

Julian immediately helped her up and sat her gently beside him, coaxing her in a soft voice.

“I was the one who couldn’t control myself. How could this be your fault?”

“Besides, Grandma made you keep the baby. You’re just a country girl, it’s not like you could make your own decisions.”

Julian dotingly rubbed her swollen belly. “Don’t overthink things anymore. It’s not good for the baby.”

Brooke’s tears turned into a smile, and she pouted, blushing, “Mr. Julian, I want to eat the roasted chestnuts from that shop on the east side of town.”

Julian didn’t hesitate for a second. He got up and started to leave.

“Wait patiently, I’ll go buy them for you right now.”

Eleanor watched him with cold eyes, her chest aching as if a thousand-pound stone was pressing down on it.

Only the two of them remained in the room.

Brooke, clutching her waist, feigned to kneel again. “Mr. Julian is being so kind to me now just to ensure a smooth delivery. He only has you in his heart, I know I don’t deserve to stay by his side.”

Eleanor wasn’t in the mood for her act. “Julian’s gone. You can drop the charade now.”

“Julian offered you a hundred million back then to leave, but you’d rather work as a maid just to stay, and you even schemed to get pregnant with his child. I know exactly what kind of person you are.”

Brooke’s expression instantly froze.

Eleanor lowered her gaze. “Rotten love is like a rotten apple. I won’t take another bite.”

“I’ll finalize the divorce papers as soon as possible. If you want to be the legitimate Mrs. Julian, it’s up to you to get him to sign them.”

Brooke’s eyebrows twitched. “Mrs. Julian, you misunderstand. I never thought of becoming Mrs. Julian…”

“I’m only giving you one chance. It’s your decision.”

A moment later, Brooke bowed ninety degrees.

“On behalf of the Julian family’s eldest grandson in my belly, thank you for making this possible, Mrs. Julian.”

Julian family’s eldest grandson?

Eleanor gave a self-deprecating laugh. “Then I wish your family of three a life of happiness.”

After Brooke left, Eleanor signed the discharge papers and checked out.

Returning to the house she’d lived in for eight years, she saw the photo wall in the living room, adorned with thousands of photos.

There was Julian’s flushed face on the day he successfully confessed his love, and Eleanor’s tear-streaked face of joy when he proposed in Bali.

Everywhere she looked were beautiful memories of her and Julian.

She called the maids to take all the photos down and piled them in the yard, burning them clean.

She’d once thought she would grow old with Julian, but she never imagined that an unassuming country girl could so easily shatter the vows Julian had made.

From now on, she and Julian would go their separate ways.

Chapter 3

Perhaps out of guilt for Eleanor, Julian had his secretary send her an invitation to the Paris Fashion Week.

Going to Paris Fashion Week had been an annual ritual for her and Julian.

Along with it came a red velvet slip dress and a Cartier jewelry set.

While she was lost in thought, Julian hugged her from behind, his voice soft.

“Eleanor, are you still mad at me?”

Eleanor’s voice trembled as she replied, “No,” her eyes immediately welling up.

Julian kissed her earlobe. “I knew you wouldn’t really stay mad at me. Once Brooke gives birth, everything will go back to how it was.”

Eleanor wanted to ask him, could they really go back?

Brooke was already a barrier between them, an uncrossable chasm.

Julian’s breath against her ear grew ragged, and one hand gripped her waist, pressing her forward.

Eleanor thought of him treating Brooke the same way, and a bitter taste filled her mouth.

She subtly moved away. “The flight’s tonight. I’ll go pack my luggage.”

Julian was left wanting more but didn’t press her.

He suddenly remembered the empty photo wall upstairs and casually asked,

“Eleanor, where did all the photos on the wall go?”

Eleanor’s eyelashes fluttered. “They were old. I wanted to take some new ones to hang up.”

Julian didn’t suspect a thing. “Sounds good. We’ll take plenty of new ones when we go to Paris.”

At dawn, Julian’s car pulled up to the villa.

When the driver took Eleanor’s suitcase, his eyes darted away, as if he wanted to say something but held back.

She immediately had a bad feeling.

Sure enough, the rear car door opened, and Brooke was sitting next to Julian.

She was wearing a linen maternity dress, her ruddy cheeks giving her a rustic yet natural look.

She nervously rubbed her hands, her voice humble and ingratiating.

“Mrs. Julian, I… I pestered Mr. Julian to let me come. Please don’t blame him…”

Before Eleanor could speak, Julian anxiously shielded Brooke behind him.

“I wasn’t comfortable leaving her alone in the country. Brooke even said she was afraid you’d think she was intruding on our private time.”

Eleanor’s lips curled into a smile. His gesture of protecting Brooke was so familiar.

For the past eight years, whenever the Julian family elders had reprimanded her, he had always protected her the same way.

The two of them, singing in unison, made it sound as if Eleanor was some sort of fearsome monster.

To Julian’s surprise, Eleanor merely said, “Whatever,” and sat in the back.

Her unusual behavior caught Julian off guard.

He observed Eleanor through the rearview mirror. She seemed too calm, which made him uneasy.

Brooke gently tugged his sleeve. “Mr. Julian, I’m thirsty…”

Julian frowned. “Water’s in the drawer to your right.”

Brooke froze.

Ever since she’d been pregnant, Julian had taken meticulous care of her, doing everything himself.

When she heard he was going to Paris with Eleanor, she’d started complaining about stomach pains early on.

Julian had been very nervous, almost canceling the trip.

It was she who “sensibly” consoled him, “Mr. Julian, I’m fine, don’t worry about me. Go with Mrs. Julian.”

How could Julian agree?

He frowned in thought for a moment. “Brooke, why don’t you come with us? It’ll be easier for me to look after you.”

Only then did she reluctantly agree to join them.

Eleanor hadn’t cried or made a fuss, and had simply agreed.

She was originally relieved, but Julian’s expression clearly showed he still cared about Eleanor.

Brooke resented it inwardly, but her face remained serene.

She deliberately exposed her bulging belly as she reached for the water, tiny beads of sweat forming on her forehead.

Julian’s attention was indeed drawn back to her. He quickly helped her sit properly.

“You’re pregnant, how can you move around so much while the car’s moving?”

He then leaned over and attentively buckled her seatbelt, adjusting the tension.

Brooke seized the opportunity to kiss his cheek. “Thank you, Mr. Julian.”

Julian’s body stiffened, and his eyes darted to Eleanor in the back.

Seeing that she was looking out the window and hadn’t noticed, he let out a slight sigh of relief.

Chapter 4

The car came to a stop, and Eleanor got out first, walking ahead.

Julian carefully helped Brooke, following behind her. They walked from the entrance to the VIP lounge, attracting countless gazes.

“Wow, that man is so handsome and attentive, constantly supporting his pregnant wife.”

“His wife looks pretty plain, but the woman in sunglasses in front of them is a top-tier beauty!”

“What’s the point of being pretty? She’s still all alone, no one loves her.”

Brooke proudly glanced at the gossiping bystanders, holding her head high, acting every bit the wealthy lady.

These words fell into Eleanor’s ears, every single one of them.

After settling Brooke, Julian sat in the seat next to Eleanor.

“Eleanor, don’t be mad at Brooke. She’s from the countryside, everything is new and exciting to her.”

Eleanor ignored him. He awkwardly covered her with a blanket.

“Ouch!”

Brooke’s gasp came from behind. She clutched her belly, her face pale as she leaned back in her seat.

“I tried to get up to grab a blanket, but I twisted my ankle… It hurts so much…”

Julian’s face changed instantly. He forcefully pushed Eleanor aside.

He half-knelt, gently massaging Brooke’s ankle, his movements as tender as if he were handling a fragile piece of art.

Eleanor’s heart ached, remembering last year when she fell off a swing and sprained her wrist.

Julian had been so heartbroken he’d cried, staying by her side almost constantly until she recovered.

At that moment, she finally believed that love doesn’t die; it simply migrates.

For the next dozen hours, Julian stayed by Brooke’s side.

“Mr. Julian, can you tell the baby a story? He loves listening to them.”

“Okay, little one, Daddy is going to tell you the story of *The Little Prince* today.”

“On a distant planet, lived a little prince… In the end, he decided to return to his beloved rose.”

Only when a tear fell onto her hand did Eleanor realize she was already in tears.

She put on her earphones, swallowed a few sleeping pills indiscriminately, and drifted into a groggy sleep.

She didn't know how long she slept, but her throat felt like it was on fire.

She struggled to get up and pour herself a glass of water, hearing laughter from the back.

“Mr. Julian, who do you think the baby will look like? I hope he looks like you, handsome and dashing… not like me, a country bumpkin.”

Brooke’s voice was soft and boneless.

Julian raised an eyebrow and smiled. “I actually hope he looks like you—kind, soft-hearted, and pure…”

Eleanor glanced at them out of the corner of her eye. Brooke, blushing, leaned against Julian.

They looked like a real couple, eagerly anticipating their unborn child.

The glass of water in Eleanor’s hand *clattered* to the floor, shattering into pieces.

She stooped down to pick it up, but her vision went black, and she fell directly.

Her palm was cut and bleeding from the shards, and the pain made her whole body tremble.

“Eleanor! What’s wrong with you?”

Julian picked her up by the waist and gently placed her in her seat.

Jealousy flashed in Brooke’s eyes. “It’s all my fault for monopolizing Mr. Julian, but Mrs. Julian, you shouldn’t hurt yourself to get his attention.”

At her words, a flicker of doubt entered Julian’s eyes.

He pulled out a tissue and pressed it to Eleanor’s bleeding palm, but his words were accusatory.

“If you wanted something, you could have just told me. Why pull a stunt like this?”

“I came with you to the Paris Fashion Show, and I bought you the jewelry you liked. What else are you not satisfied with?”

Eleanor looked over his shoulder at Brooke, who was watching her with cold eyes, not a trace of the country woman’s simplicity left.

Julian followed her gaze to Brooke, who immediately put on an innocent, bewildered expression.

Julian frowned. “You fell and hurt your hand. Are you blaming Brooke for that too?”

Eleanor pulled back her still-bleeding hand, her words crumbling into a choked sob on her tongue.

“Julian, do you really think I’m such a despicable person?”

Chapter 5

Julian’s hand hung in mid-air. He realized he’d spoken too harshly.

“Eleanor, that’s not what I meant, I was saying…”

Eleanor shook her head, interrupting him. “We’re landing soon. Please call a doctor for me. Thank you.”

The plane inevitably experienced some turbulence during landing, and Brooke shrieked, hiding in Julian’s embrace.

Julian patiently soothed her, “I’m here, nothing will happen to you.”

Eleanor’s heart tightened. He had said the same words to her once.

That year, Julian was 22, and he rushed in front of a group of thugs who had surrounded Eleanor.

He was clearly scared himself, yet he stretched out his arms to shield her behind him.

“Don’t be scared, Eleanor. I’m here, nothing will happen to you.”

The plane landed smoothly. A private doctor bandaged her hand.

“The wound is a bit deep. It might leave a scar.”

Eleanor whispered her thanks, and a flicker of distress crossed Julian’s eyes.

Brooke pulled his arm, murmuring, “Mr. Julian, will I have an ugly scar on my stomach after I have the baby?”

Julian chuckled softly. “I’ll find the best doctors in the world. I promise it won’t leave any mark.”

Brooke smiled sweetly, “Thank you, Mr. Julian!”

Upon arriving at the hotel, Brooke pestered Julian to take her sightseeing.

“I’ve lived in the village my whole life, I’ve never seen such beautiful streets.”

Julian immediately took her on a shopping spree in Paris, bags of luxury goods piling up at the hotel.

Hermes, Chanel, diamond jewelry…

Brooke linked Julian’s arm, her face innocent. “Mr. Julian, how much do these cost? Is it enough to build a house in my hometown?”

Julian looked at her tenderly. “Silly girl, if you like it, I’ll buy it for you. You don’t need to worry about money. You’re the Julian family’s biggest hero, after all.”

As soon as he spoke, he saw Eleanor standing around the corner.

His expression stiffened. “Eleanor, why don’t you come pick something you like too?”

Eleanor turned and returned to her room. Brooke’s voice drifted from behind her.

“Mr. Julian, give all these to Mrs. Julian. How could a country woman like me deserve such nice things…”

Julian frowned. “Don’t belittle yourself. Who says you don’t deserve them? Eleanor has plenty at home. I’ll take her shopping next time.”

As night fell, Julian, citing Brooke’s discomfort with the foreign environment, spent the entire night by her side.

The next day, when Eleanor arrived at the show, Julian and Brooke were already seated in the reserved spots.

Julian pointed to the cramped seat next to him. “Brooke’s back hurts from sitting too long. Let her have this chair.”

Eleanor acted indifferent. “I’m just here to see the show, not a public display of affection.”

Julian was speechless.

Eleanor had been eagerly awaiting this spring/summer show, as it featured her favorite designer.

As the wedding dress collection began its walk, Brooke’s eyes widened.

“Is this a wedding dress? It’s so beautiful!”

Julian looked at her with soft eyes. “Do you like it?”

Brooke lowered her head with a look of regret. “I do, but I’ll probably never get a chance to wear such a beautiful wedding dress in my life.”

Julian seemed moved. “Who says you won’t? Which one do you like? I’ll buy it for you. After you have the baby, we can do a wedding photoshoot.”

Brooke looked at him with admiration. “Really, Mr. Julian?”

“But I don’t have a groom…”

Eleanor cleared her throat. “Mr. Julian has already been a one-night groom, what’s a wedding photoshoot with you?”

Julian’s face turned ashen. He opened his mouth and called out, “Eleanor.”

Suddenly, the chandelier directly above his head *clicked* and then crashed down.

Chapter 6

“Mr. Julian, watch out!”

Brooke shrieked, throwing herself selflessly towards Julian.

The heavy chandelier crashed onto her back, sending crystal shards scattering.

Julian’s face instantly drained of color. “Brooke!”

Brooke slightly lifted her chin. “You’re okay. That’s good.”

After saying that, she fainted in his arms.

Julian’s lips trembled slightly. He scooped her up and rushed out.

“Everyone, get out of the way!”

His shoulder slammed hard into Eleanor – *Thud!*

She was knocked to the ground, her forehead hitting the corner of the catwalk. Blood immediately flowed.

She lay on the ground, staring blankly at Julian’s receding back. Pregnant, selflessly saving someone.

Brooke would never be erased from Julian’s heart now.

Eleanor, helped by those around her, stood up and stumbled towards the hospital alone.

Just as she reached the emergency room entrance, she ran straight into Julian.

A nurse rushed over. “The pregnant woman needs a blood transfusion, but the blood bank doesn’t have RH-negative blood right now. Are there any family members who can donate?”

Julian turned and grabbed her wrist. “Eleanor, you’re RH-negative. Save Brooke!”

She looked at him in disbelief. He knew she was anemic.

Because her anemia had been so severe once, he’d invested in building a private hospital.

There was an entire medical team on standby for her 24 hours a day.

But now?

Julian’s voice was urgent and brooked no refusal. “Brooke was hurt trying to save me. You can’t be so selfish!”

Without waiting for Eleanor to speak, he forcefully pushed her into the blood donation room.

The thick needle pierced her vein, and Eleanor couldn’t help but press her hand to her chest.

Her heart felt as if an invisible giant hand was squeezing it, hurting so much she couldn’t breathe.

Six hundred cc’s of blood were drawn.

Julian’s gaze was anxiously fixed on Brooke’s direction, completely oblivious to Eleanor’s pale face.

After the blood draw, Julian finally came to his senses.

“How did your forehead get hurt?”

“I’m so sorry, Eleanor. I’ll have a doctor give you a full check-up and then bandage it for you.”

Eleanor curled her lips in a self-deprecating smile, letting him push her into the examination room.

Soon, the doctor walked out with the examination report.

Julian rushed forward to ask, “How is my wife?”

The doctor shook his head. “Why did you let her donate blood? Don’t you know she’s already pregna…”

A nurse suddenly ran out. “Brooke’s family? She woke up and has been calling for ‘Mr. Julian’.”

Julian turned and left without hesitation, not hearing the rest of the doctor’s words.

“Ms. Eleanor, you’re already anemic, and you’re eight weeks pregnant! Donating blood is extremely dangerous!”

Eleanor took the report in surprise. “I’m pregnant?”

Her mind went blank. The next second, a warm gush flowed from her lower abdomen.

She slowly looked down. Fresh blood was streaming down her inner thigh, dripping onto the floor.

Before she passed out, she saw Julian gently stroking Brooke’s face.

When she woke up, Eleanor was lying alone in the hospital bed.

The doctor regretfully informed her, “You donated too much blood. We couldn’t save the baby.”

Tears streamed from her eyes.

She fiercely pounded the bed, soft whimpers escaping her throat.

Eleanor insisted on being discharged, despite the doctor’s objections.

She dragged her weak body back to the hotel, standing in front of the bathroom mirror, laughing and crying.

She looked down at the wedding ring stuck on her ring finger, and with a harsh tug.

The diamond ring *clinked* as it rolled into the drain.
