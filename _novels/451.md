Just because the female intern got drunk at the company team building event, my husband took advantage of my business trip to bring her home.

He made Tiana wear my lingerie and used up all the condoms in the house in one night.

After receiving an alert from the security camera on my phone, I immediately sent the footage to the company's group chat with 500 people.

"Is Mr. Huo so frugal that he can't even afford to book a hotel room?" I commented sarcastically.

Liam was so caught up in the moment that he thought it was a private message. He replied without even stopping his actions:

"You're just a tool I married to please my family. Do you really think you're Mrs. Huo? If you know what's good for you, hurry up and buy more condoms!"

The group chat fell silent, everyone secretly watching our confrontation.

I let out a cold snort. Since he treated me like a tool, I'd show him the consequences of angering this "tool"!

I immediately withdrew all resource support for the Huo family and terminated all cooperation with them.

Five minutes later, Liam called me furiously.

"Mia, what's the meaning of this? I just made a mistake in the heat of the moment. Do you have to make such a big deal out of it?"

"And what's with you posting that video in the company group chat? Tiana is just a young girl. How can she ever show her face at work again?"

The usually dignified and composed Liam was now angrily shouting and listing my faults for the sake of an intern, without mentioning a word about how his infidelity had hurt me.

Even through the screen, I could almost feel his spit flying at my face.

I replied calmly, "You have five minutes to get that woman out of my house."

"Oh, and she can keep that lingerie set. I find it disgusting now."

Five minutes later, Liam sent me a video.

The stained bedsheets had been changed. The bedroom was clean and tidy. Both the lingerie and Tiana had disappeared from the Huo residence.

Satisfied, I notified the Zhou family: "The cooperation will continue as usual."

Then I sent him another video, showing all the contracts with the Huo family's profits reduced by 10%.

"Liam, this is just a warning. If you really piss me off, do you think you can still comfortably sit in your current position?"

Feeling unsatisfied, I found photos of several shirtless foreign models with six-pack abs and sent him some intimate selfies with them.

"If you think drunk sex is no big deal, then I don't mind starting a second spring of my own."

The "typing..." indicator on the chat window showed for a long time, but no message came through in the end.

I knew he was suppressing his anger, but I no longer wanted to cater to his emotions.

Back in the day, Liam was a notorious playboy in the city, a regular at bars. His ex-girlfriends could form a line twice around the city.

But ever since the Huo family announced the arranged marriage, he cut off contact with all other women and knelt outside my house for six months through wind and rain. He said he was foolish before and only realized what true love was after meeting me.

Combined with what he said in the group chat, I now understood that the Huo family wouldn't let those shady ex-girlfriends of his into their home. He only married me to please his family.

For two years after our marriage, he did indeed behave himself and didn't fool around. Every day he just went between the company and home, either accompanying me or working overtime.

I thought he had truly settled down, but I didn't expect Liam to start preying on women close to home, moving his flirting grounds from bars and nightclubs to the company.

Looking back now, all those promises and vows were nothing but bullshit.

This time, stopping the cooperation and withdrawing resources was just to teach him a lesson.

The next day when I returned from my business trip, I just wanted to go home and catch up on sleep. But I received a call from the company manager.

There was an order that needed Liam's signature, but he had gone out early in the morning with Tiana.

I had no choice but to head to the company. After signing the papers, Liam still hadn't returned.

I took out my phone, about to call him, when a payment notification popped up on the screen.

"Your Black Card completed a payment of $328,260 at Loro Piana at 9:30 AM."

My brows furrowed. This store only sells high-end women's jewelry. Using my card to buy jewelry for another woman?

Interesting.

Leaving the company, I took a cab straight to the brand store.

Through the display window, I saw Tiana excitedly putting on that necklace, hooking her arm through Liam's and happily giving him a kiss on the cheek.

Seeing her delighted expression, Liam affectionately pinched her nose.

Liam was always extremely serious about work and would never skip work without reason. He only took one day off each year on my birthday.

But now he ignored company business just to take an intern shopping.

I walked into the store with a gloomy face. Seeing me, Tiana immediately let go of Liam and smiled ingratiatingly with a shrug:

"Mrs. Zhou, what brings you here?"

I glanced at her cheap act with disdain: "Do I need to report to you where I go? I should be the one asking - as an intern, can you just skip work whenever you want?"

Tiana didn't dare speak, looking guiltily towards Liam.

He steadied his expression: "I brought her here. She's not adjusting well to the company, so I brought her out to relax a bit."

Then he patted Tiana, telling her not to mind and to go back to the company first.

Tiana was about to leave when I stopped her sternly:

"The necklace is mine. Take it off! Wearing someone else's lingerie is one thing, but you like secondhand jewelry too? Addicted to mooching off others?"

She froze for a moment, lowering her head in embarrassment as her face turned bright red.

I pointed at the necklace around her neck and looked at Liam:

"An intern is worth such an expensive gift? Liam, did you not hear what I said yesterday?"

Liam looked impatient: "That's enough, Mia. You already humiliated Tiana at the company yesterday. Can't I make it up to her a little?"

I couldn't help but laugh: "Make it up to her? So this is the extent of Mr. Huo's abilities - using his wife's card to please other women."

"A $300,000 necklace - is she even worthy of it?"

Confusion flashed in his eyes. After checking the card in his hand, he realized he had used the wrong one.

Having lost face in public, he immediately became enraged, the veins on his hand almost popping out.

"Mia, if you're upset, take it out on me. Don't bully a young girl. Besides, if you hadn't humiliated Tiana so badly, would I have done this?"

"It's just a damn necklace. I'll pay you back double, okay?"
