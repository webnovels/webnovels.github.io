"Ms. Tessier, are you sure you wish to donate all of your organs?"

"Yes, I'm sure."

After uttering those words, Cindy Tessier managed a faint smile, as if a great weight had been lifted from her shoulders.

The doctor was taken aback and tried to convince her again. "Even though the cancer is in its later stages, aggressive treatment in the hospital could still offer a chance to prolong your life."

Cindy's smile grew, and without hesitation, she shook her head. "No, Doctor, death is something I await every day. I'm probably down to my last month. I'll let the hospital know when it's getting close. Just make sure all my organs go to someone who needs them. Thank you."

With that, she rose to her feet, a smile on her face, and walked away.

The doctor watched her leave with a look of astonishment. In all his years of practice, he'd never encountered a patient so determined to face death.

No sooner had Cindy stepped out of the hospital than her phone rang. It was Arthur Forsyth.

His voice, cool and slightly husky, came through the line. "Where'd you go today? You took the day off."

Cindy's grip on the phone tightened just a fraction.

"I've got a cold," she replied, sidestepping the truth.

It was clear the man on the other end wasn't asking out of genuine concern.

"Get over to Eclipsion Club, Room 314. Now," he said.

Without a single word of protest, Cindy made her way there immediately. Upon entering the private room, she found it was packed with Arthur's business associates.

"Ms. Tessier, you've finally arrived. We've heard so much about you. They say you can down a thousand glasses without feeling a buzz."

"Word is, you've sealed plenty of deals over drinks. You'll have to prove your skills tonight."

"See these 99 glasses on the table? Finish them all, and the deal is yours!"

Arthur sat on the couch nearby with an unreadable smile.

"Don't let me down," he said, his tone indifferent.

All eyes were fixed on Cindy, the air thick with anticipation. She didn't refuse.

She smiled as she picked up the first glass and said, "I'll do my best then."

One glass followed another, and the searing pain in her stomach flared up almost immediately. For someone battling stomach cancer, it was ten times worse.

Cindy's face turned pale, her hands shaking uncontrollably. But she didn't stop. She kept drinking, glass after glass.

Arthur observed her from start to finish, his gaze cold and detached.

At last, Cindy downed the final glass, the 99th, under the stunned stares of everyone.

The private room erupted in applause, with voices calling out, "Unbelievable! You're amazing!"

Cindy's forehead glistened with a sheen of cold sweat as she managed a strained smile.

The business partner, clearly intrigued, remarked, "Ms. Tessier, you're wasting your potential with Mr. Forsyth. Look at how he's running you ragged, without a second thought for your well-being. Why not come work for me instead?"

Cindy smiled and politely turned him down. "I appreciate the offer, but Mr. Forsyth has always been good to me."

"I'll triple your salary!"

Still, Cindy held firm, shaking her head.

The room buzzed with confusion. "Why won't you leave?"

Her smile faltered as she answered, "I stay because I have a debt to repay."

Thinking she must owe money to Forsyth Group, the business partner let out a resigned sigh and dropped the matter.

In the end, the deal went through smoothly. As the group began to disperse, the sky outside had already grown dark.

The driver came to pick them up from a short distance away, and Cindy slid smoothly into the passenger seat. Arthur didn't like her sitting beside him.

The car stopped in front of Cindy's apartment building, and she murmured a "thank you" before stepping out, exhaustion weighing heavily on her. She was so tired that she didn't even notice Arthur following her.

He watched as she stumbled forward, his gaze darkening with an intensity that was hard to decipher.

Cindy remained oblivious as she made her way upstairs, even as she reached her door and stopped to fish out her keys.

Out of nowhere, a hand clamped around her wrist, spinning her around and pinning her against the wall.

The sound-activated light in the hallway flickered on just as Arthur gripped her chin and kissed her. The kiss was fierce and relentless, leaving Cindy breathless and overwhelmed.

When Arthur finally pulled back, his eyes were red with emotion, his voice shaking, despite it being him who had initiated the kiss.

"Why do you keep doing this?" he demanded. "Are you trying to make me feel sorry for you? Why don't you just leave when people give you the chance, Cindy? Why won't you go?"

Cindy gasped for breath, struggling to calm her emotions. "I'm staying to make up for what I've done."

Her words set Arthur off again. He slammed his fist into the wall, his glare sharp enough to pierce through her with sheer hatred.

"Why don't you just drop dead then? Go on, do it!" he yelled.

Cindy gave a bitter smile. Her life already hung by a thread, as if he'd gotten his wish. She was on the verge of speaking when Arthur's phone rang. She glanced down and caught the name on the screen.

Annette Sommer. His fiancée.

Arthur's breathing grew heavier when he saw her name. He turned away as if gathering himself. When he finally answered the call, his voice eased into something deep and tender, the polished version of himself slipping effortlessly into place.

"Ann."

Whatever was said on the other end of the line brought a subtle shift to his expression. The next moment, he released Cindy without a word, turned, and walked away.

Cindy leaned against the wall, her eyes fixed on his retreating figure until he was out of sight. Only then did she finally give in to the overwhelming urge, bolting through the door and into the bathroom, where she vomited violently.

She heaved until the room felt like it was spinning. After what seemed like forever, she finally lifted her head and saw the toilet bowl smeared with vivid streaks of blood.

Numbly, Cindy pressed the flush button. She tried to get herself up, but her body, exhausted and weak, failed her, and she crumpled into unconsciousness.

She dreamed of a time back in college, strolling under the shade of the sycamore trees with Arthur and Winter Forsyth.

Winter tugged at her arm, whining playfully, "Cindy, there's a mixer this weekend between our department and the law school. You've got to come with me, okay?"

Arthur's face clouded over, and he pulled Cindy closer. "Winter, did I say you could borrow my girlfriend?"

"Arthur, you're so possessive!"

Those were such beautiful days.

Cindy had been an orphan since she was a child. During her school years, she'd met Winter, and the two had immediately clicked, becoming inseparable friends.

Arthur, Winter's older brother, was the untouchable figure at school. He was aloof, refined, and seemingly indifferent to women. He received countless love letters every day, but would disregard them without a second thought.

At first, Cindy was too intimidated to even speak to him. But somehow, he kept showing up in her life. He'd help her organize her notes, join her at the library, and walk her home.

One day, when Cindy forgot her umbrella, Arthur showed up in the downpour to get her.

Standing under the same umbrella, she finally gathered the courage to ask, "Arthur, are you only this nice to me because of Winter?"

He backed her up against a wall, his face clouded over. "Cindy, you really don't get it, do you? Let me spell it out for you. This is why I treat you the way I do."

Then, he cradled the back of her head and kissed her.

From that day on, they were a couple. That was, until five years ago, the night before their wedding, when Cindy and Winter went to see a movie.

It was well into the night when they turned down a narrow alley and ran into a group of drunk thugs. The men were clearly wasted, their words laced with crude and vulgar insults.

They backed Cindy and Winter into a dead end, leaving them no escape. Both women, young and unprepared for this, trembled with fear.

In the end, Winter mustered all her strength to fend off the thugs, shouting, "Cindy, run!"

Cindy knew they stood no chance against the drunken mob, so she bolted. She ran to the street on the other side to seek help. But when she returned with help, the alley was unnervingly quiet.

The drunk men were gone, leaving only a scene of destruction behind. Winter lay still on the ground, bloodied and violated in ways no one should ever be. She wasn't breathing anymore.

When Arthur arrived, he was met with the horrifying sight of Winter's body. The extent of her suffering was unmistakable. His mind went blank.

He gripped Cindy's hand, his voice quivering with anguish and despair as he cried out, "Why did you run? Why did you leave her alone? Cindy, why did you run?"

Cindy couldn't answer. She hated herself more than anyone ever could.

In the end, the Forsyth family couldn't bring themselves to forgive her. She had lost her closest friend, and the man she loved more than anything now saw her as an enemy.

But now, at last, death was near. Soon, Cindy would have the chance to beg Winter's forgiveness in the afterlife. And Arthur would finally be free.
