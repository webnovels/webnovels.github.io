I never thought Serena would return one day, or that Damian would push me into an abyss for her.

“Damian, darling, I heard you found a stand-in. I’m so sorry, you must have had it tough these past three years. I’ll make it up to you.” Serena’s voice was cloyingly sweet.

Damian, however, seemed to relish it. “Serena, it’s enough that you’re back.”

With that, they embraced and kissed as if I wasn’t even there.

After a while, Serena suddenly feigned surprise. “Oh, Damian, darling, we completely forgot Miss Evans is still here!”

“She’s not important. Just pretend she’s air,” Damian said, glancing at me with a look of disdain.

“I heard Damian has been training you every day? He wants you to become me? Hmph, you’re clearly out of your depth. Damian, darling, this cheap imitation is terrible, she doesn’t look anything like me!” Serena batted her eyelashes at me, playfully tugging on Damian’s arm.

“Don’t be angry, Serena. It’s only because you left, and I missed you so terribly, that I reluctantly found a stand-in. How could a woman like her ever compare to you?”

Yes, a woman like me was just a clown, meant for their amusement.

Seeing me stand there in silence, Serena immediately put on a wronged expression. “Damian, darling, look at her sour face. Doesn’t she welcome me back? Maybe I should just leave.”

Damian immediately slapped me, warning me, “Chloe Evans, Serena is the true mistress of this house. You’d better be polite to her, or I have countless ways to deal with you. Go, get Serena a glass of water, then pack her luggage.”

“Oh, Damian, darling, don’t hit her for my sake. Besides, Miss Evans isn’t my maid. Look, she’s so pitiful.”

“It’s her blessing to be your maid.”

Serena intimately linked her arm through Damian’s, resting her head on his shoulder, proudly asserting her dominance over me.

Damian, since your beloved Serena is back, then let me go!

Watching them walk away, I clenched my fists, my nails digging deep into my palms.

Ever since Serena returned, Damian didn’t even bother with pretenses.

They were openly intimate in front of me, even leaving the doors open, deliberately making me listen to them.

Serena’s cries made my face burn, and Damian’s heavy breathing made me want to flee.

Afterward, Serena would look at me with a smug, triumphant expression, then feign regret. “Oh, I’m so sorry, Miss Evans! I forgot you were still at home! Damian, darling, aren’t we being too naughty? Miss Evans will be sad!”

“She’s not important, Serena. As long as you’re happy!” Damian wrapped his arm around Serena, not even sparing me a glance.

“Damian, since Miss Lewis is back, let’s get a divorce. I wish you and Miss Lewis happiness.”

Three years. I couldn’t bear to stay in this place for another day. I couldn’t endure this humiliating life for another moment.

Just as I expected Damian to agree without hesitation, he shockingly smashed a glass. “Chloe Evans, you want to leave? Don’t you dare dream of it. You’ll die in my house, even if it’s over my dead body.”

I didn’t understand. If he didn’t love me and despised me so much, why wouldn’t he let me go? Was it just to continue humiliating me?

Serena clearly hadn’t expected Damian’s reaction. She glared at me fiercely, then turned and walked away, linking her arm with Damian.
