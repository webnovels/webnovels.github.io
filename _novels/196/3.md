The next day, Jasper entered the dungeon, his expression both gentle and mad.

 I hung in the water dungeon, with any slight movement, my fingers felt excruciating pain. He carefully untied me, gently washed my body. 

He patiently dressed me in a dress, combed my hair, even applied a light lipstick. He finally spoke, "Last night I dreamed of Lydia." 

"She said she's lonely down there, I plan to send you to accompany her." My blood froze instantly, he was going to bury me with Lydia. His tone was so gentle, as if coaxing a child, "Don't be afraid, it won't hurt, it will be over soon."

 I wanted to escape, but dragging my severely injured body, I couldn't run. Like a puppet, I numbly let him manipulate me. The car stopped before a desolate cemetery, the surroundings were deathly silent.

 Jasper carried me, walking through a long gravel path, arriving at a grave with a blank monument. He pointed at the monument, his eyes filled with pathological madness, "Look, this is Lydia's home."

My blood ran cold. He wanted me to be buried with Lydia.

His voice was gentle, as if coaxing a child, "Don't be afraid, it won't hurt, and it will be over soon."

I wanted to escape, but with my severely injured body, I couldn't run away. I was like a puppet, numbly letting him control me.

The car stopped in front of a quiet cemetery, surrounded by a deathly silence. Jasper held me, walking through a long gravel path to a tomb with an unmarked headstone. 

He pointed at the headstone, his eyes filled with a pathological madness, "Look, this is Lydia's home."

"Don't be angry, Lydia. I didn't put your name on it to keep anyone from disturbing your sweet dreams."

He then pointed to a freshly dug grave next to the unmarked stone and said to me, "Adeline, this is your new home."

I wanted to laugh at myself, but I couldn't. I wanted to cry, but no tears came. This was the real Jasper, a madman smiling while burying me alive.

He placed me into the cold, damp grave. At that moment, my heart was ashen. Just as the grave was about to be sealed, an offering on a nearby gravestone was knocked over, making a noise.

Jasper turned around sharply, his gaze fierce. The moment he saw who it was, his body froze. His face went from blank, to surprised, to ecstatic, finally turning into a near-mad longing.

He trembled as he spoke, "Lydia... is it you?"

Jasper, like a child who had lost his mind, stumbled toward her and hugged her tightly, almost crushing her into his body. The once-calculating Jasper was now crying uncontrollably.

"Lydia, you're alive... Is this a dream?"

"I missed you so much, why didn't you come to find me?"

Realizing she had been discovered, Lydia decided to play along. "I thought I would never see you again, I was so scared."

"I barely escaped, and all I could think about was finding you. But I was afraid you'd moved on, so I just watched from afar. Brother still cares about me..."

Jasper looked pained, "Silly girl, you're my most precious person. My heart could burst with pain."

Watching their intimate display, I realized how unnecessary I was. Since she was discovered, Lydia continued her act. She collapsed weakly into Jasper's arms, sobbing softly.

"I thought I'd never see you again. I was so scared."

"I barely escaped, and all I could think about was finding you. But I was afraid you’d moved on, so I just watched from afar."

"Brother still cares about me, that's wonderful."

Jasper cupped her face, his eyes full of pity, "Silly girl, how could I not care about you? My heart could burst with pain."

I had never seen him so out of control. This man, who was so heartless and ruthless to me, dropped all his defenses in front of Lydia.

It seemed Jasper had forgotten my existence, eagerly entwined with Lydia. Completely ignoring me, still in the cold grave.

The sounds of their intimacy intertwined. At that moment, I felt utterly pathetic and ridiculous.

Suddenly, Lydia smirked at me. She deliberately nudged the grave lid with her foot, and with a dull thud, the lid closed.

Darkness swallowed me instantly, and the air in the grave became increasingly thin. Breathing became harder and harder. I gasped for air, desperately pounding on the walls, leaving bloody scratches on the wood.

But there was no response. My brain started hallucinating, and my consciousness blurred...

Just when I was about to give up, there was a frantic knocking from above the grave. Fresh air rushed into my lungs.

Jasper's bodyguards nervously pulled me out of the grave. The cemetery was already devoid of Jasper and Lydia's presence.

I was completely disheartened, with no lingering feelings for Jasper.

But when I got home, Jasper suddenly began to take care of me meticulously, as if making up for something or hiding something.

I knew he still needed me as a "wife" to face danger and protect Lydia. It didn't matter anymore; I no longer cared about anything here.

Anyway, I would leave first thing in the morning. Given my special status, I didn't need divorce papers or anything like that.

When I decided to leave, I had my ways to disappear completely from Jasper's world, making sure he could never find me.

But before I could leave, an unexpected situation arose. The organization sent me an order: "Attention, the Black Scorpion Assassination Group has appeared. Head to the charity site immediately to protect Jasper."

I intended to leave quietly, but it seemed I had to meet Jasper again.

At the charity gala, I silently stood in a corner. It was the best observation spot. Years of training had made my senses unusually sharp, and nothing escaped my eyes in the crowd.

On stage, Jasper looked at Lydia with deep affection. She cooperated with a happy expression, "I once thought silently protecting you was enough. Now I want the whole world to know I love you, only you."

"Tonight, I'm transferring all my financial assets to your name, so you can always be a carefree princess."

"Anything you want, I'll give you!"

The audience burst into applause, and flashes went off one after another.

"So this is Jasper's true love? They really are a perfect match, a match made in heaven."

"He's got the looks and talent, and she's so much gentler than that shrew Adeline. Even I, as a woman, want to cherish her..."

Listening to the mockery directed at me, I was long past caring.

At that moment, Jasper's gaze swept the crowd, unintentionally meeting mine in the corner. His once gentle eyes flashed with impatience and disgust.

Maybe he thought I was there to pester him. After all, I used to claim my territory at similar events, but he always let me.

What I thought was favoritism was a complete deception.

Suddenly, an unusual signal interference appeared inside the venue, and the lights went out, plunging the scene into chaos.
