The 99th lash broke during the beating, blood slowly dripped down my scarred legs, echoing in the dim, damp dungeon. 

My legs had long lost feeling, hanging unnaturally, my hands bound with rough ropes, shoulders dislocated. I couldn't remember how many days had passed. Jasper's bodyguard couldn't bear it, "Boss, if you keep this up, the madam will die."

 Jasper's face was full of hatred, "I can't let her die so easily. I want her to kneel at Lydia's grave every day, offering incense in repentance."

 "A lifetime of torment is the greatest punishment for her." The rope suddenly loosened, and I fell heavily to the ground, my broken legs twisting grotesquely. My face scraped against the rough ground, burning with pain.

 But compared to the tearing in my heart, this physical pain was insignificant. Jasper grabbed my hair, dragging me to a pristine tombstone. It was a blank monument he had erected for Lydia.

 He gripped my neck, slamming my head onto the ground.

 "Who do you think you are? Just because I married you, you think you're Mrs. White?" "Aren't you an agent? Agents are supposed to be tough. Why are you crying? Stand up!"

 He roared, "I protected Lydia for five years, never raising my voice, afraid of her slightest grievance." "How dare you harm her, who gave you the courage?" 

"Bang, bang, bang..." A series of crashes, I felt my head was about to shatter, ears buzzing. I was the best agent, bleed but don't cry, I couldn't cry, even if my teeth shattered, I had to swallow them. But why does my heart hurt so much? Jasper, how could you bear to treat me like this? 

Why do you treat me like this? I wanted to argue, but only weak whimpers came from my throat. Jasper's sharply defined face was inches away, but those eyes no longer held any of the past tenderness.

 He stepped on my already deformed hand, grinding it, the sound of bones breaking was clear. I lay on the ground, curling up and whimpering. 

Seeing me in such a humiliating state, Jasper finally smiled with satisfaction, "Call the doctor, I'll give you the best treatment, with the best medicine."

 "Tomorrow… I'll come see you again." He was like a demon from hell, giving me despair again and again. Watching Jasper's departing figure, my thoughts drifted back to the past. 

Jasper's business spanned the globe—finance, medicine, weapons, technology—he was involved in almost every industry, and his public identity was a philanthropist.

 Many assassination organizations wanted him dead to take over his business empire, and I was sent to protect him. 

To avoid suspicion from enemies, I forced him to marry me, so I could be by his side 24/7. But I made a fatal mistake, I fell in love with him.

 Over the years, I've used my life countless times to shield him from assassinations, but it was all in vain! He didn't listen to my explanation, directly accusing me of a baseless crime.

 To him, I was just an unimportant tool. I couldn't help but smile bitterly. Since that's the case, I should leave.
