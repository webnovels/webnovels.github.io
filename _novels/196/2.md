Jasper arranged the best medical team to treat me. He personally took the ointment handed by the doctor, gently applying it to my wounds. 

He fed me ginseng soup spoon by spoon, but his words were so cold, "Seeing you so obedient, I won't punish you today."

 I knew he didn't want me dead; he wanted to torment me every day to vent his anger for his beloved. I struggled to speak, "When I arrived that day, Lydia was already gone. I didn't kill her, I really didn't..." Before I finished, Jasper's gaze turned icy, he smashed the soup bowl in his hand, "You don't deserve to mention her name!"

 "I've already investigated, it was you who pushed her into the basement during the explosion, stop denying it." He turned and ordered the guards, "Increase the intensity of the electric shocks."

 Then he walked out the door without looking back. My heart grew numb, maybe soaked in icy water for too long, I couldn't feel the pain anymore.

 He never believed me, not even a sliver of trust. The electric shocks were too strong, my consciousness began to blur. Before I fainted, I heard Jasper and the bodyguard talking outside. "Boss, if you only love Lydia, why did you agree to marry Adeline?"

 "With your strength, no matter what means Adeline used, she couldn't force you to marry her." Jasper was silent for a moment, his voice carried a gentleness I'd never heard before, "You don't understand what it feels like to truly love someone."

 "Lydia is a pure good girl, unlike me, I live on the edge of a knife, I couldn't bear her to suffer if enemies involved her." 

The bodyguard suddenly understood, "So you married Adeline, all the enemies would target Adeline, in reality protecting Miss Lydia." Jasper softly responded, "Adeline is different…" "Even facing all kinds of torture, she can easily cope with the training she received since childhood." 

The bodyguard hesitated, "What if she can't withstand it?" Jasper's voice was cold, "Then it's her fate." I felt all the blood in my body freeze, my heart turned cold. So, I was just a shield Jasper used to protect Lydia. No wonder, many times when I was kidnapped, the kidnappers directly targeted Mrs.

 White. It was all part of his plan. The feeling of being deceived and used was more painful than any torture

. I don't know how long it was before the sound of high heels echoed outside the door. A familiar figure appeared at the door, Lydia! 

"You're not dead!" Lydia chuckled, "Surprised? I'm alive and well, fooled both you and Jasper." "Men, you can't get emotionally involved.

 Tsk tsk, look at you, tormented like this for a man, you disgrace the agents." Her slender fingers brushed over the blank monument, "He's such a clever person, yet I played him like a fiddle, it's really amusing." "Jasper is rich, devoted, handsome, and in bed... top-notch, it feels great to play with." Lydia was not the weak woman needing protection from Jasper. 

She used his love for her. And I became a pawn in her scheme. "Who exactly are you?" Lydia's lips curled into a meaningful smile.

 "I'm only after wealth, not lives." "I want him to watch his financial empire, built over years, crumble." "You better protect your husband, many people want him dead."

 She made a "shush" gesture with her fingers, "And... Jasper actually loves you, he just doesn't realize it yet. I can't wait to see his face when he realizes it after you've been tortured to death…" "We'll meet again." 

Lydia quickly disappeared into the night. When Jasper forced me to bow and repent again, the blank monument suddenly broke. Lydia had tampered with the monument! Jasper was furious, kicking and hitting me, "Your repentance is insincere!" I looked at his angry face, feeling only deep sorrow. This man, blinded by love, had become someone else's pawn without realizing it. 

I closed my eyes, letting tears silently fall. This was the last time I cried for Jasper, also for my foolish self. Goodbye, Jasper.

 I sent a message to the organization using a secret communicator, "I should return to the agency." "I don't want to protect him anymore."
