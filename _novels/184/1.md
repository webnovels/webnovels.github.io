When I opened my eyes, only Finn Beckett was sitting by the hospital bed. Seeing me awake, he appeared sorrowful, but there was a gleam of glee in his eyes he couldn't hide.

"Nora, your wrist is broken. Even if it heals, it might never be as flexible as before."

"So your racing career might..."

I looked at his insincere face, feeling a bitter taste in my heart. To protect him, I let my side of the car take the brunt of the crash with the cliff.

That’s why I was severely injured and had broken bones, while he only had minor injuries.

But at that moment, I wished he had been smashed to bits.

As I was brooding over this, Eloise suddenly burst in with a group of reporters.

"Nora, you scared me to death!"

She threw herself beside the bed, sobbing dramatically as if she might faint. The reporters played along with her act of deep sisterly affection.

"Miss Eloise didn’t even attend the celebration party and rushed over. Truly a good friend!"

Eloise seized the opportunity to speak, her voice choked with tears.

"I've been friends with Nora for seven years. Forget the celebration party; I’d give up my debut stage for her!"

I didn’t want to watch her hypocritical performance and slowly opened my mouth.

"You must be thrilled I had a car accident, right?"

"After all, if I won the championship, your debut stage would be overshadowed."

Eloise had a moment of panic but quickly put on a wronged expression.

"I know you're upset about losing the competition."

"If my successful debut makes you feel unbalanced, I'm willing to exit the industry for you..."

Her acting was impressive, painting me as someone who can't stand seeing a friend succeed with just a few words.

The reporters were at a loss due to this sudden change, and the entire ward went silent enough to hear a pin drop.

At this moment, Finn Beckett, who had been silent for a long time, scolded me.

"If you can't be happy for Eloise’s good fortune, fine! But why take it out on her because you're in a bad mood?"

I sharply looked at him, holding back the urge to tear his mouth apart.

"You, as a navigator, gave wrong instructions and got me injured. What right do you have to criticize me?"

Finn Beckett was guilty of deliberately hurting me. Seeing me expose his negligence, he became angry out of shame.

"Why don't you win without a navigator, huh? Aren’t you so great?"

"Oh, I forgot! Now with your hand ruined, you can't win a competition with or without a navigator!"

"What legendary racing driver! Nora Quinn, you're just a has-been now!"

His venomous words made me tremble with anger, and I couldn't help but retort.

"So what?"

"People will remember a fallen champion, but they won’t remember you as the eternal second place!"

Finn Beckett was hit where it hurt, his eyes nearly popping out.

"Just because I couldn’t beat you before doesn’t mean I can’t now!"

"If you have the guts, race me one more time! The loser will leave the racing world forever!"

Looking at the man in front of me, my whole heart was wrapped in pain and hatred. For four years, he had been my confidant and the other half of my soul on the track. Now, to destroy me, he was forcing me while I was injured.

"Fine, I'll race you."

Seeing me agree, Finn Beckett snorted and walked out. Eloise also dropped the act and left with the reporters, smugly.

I watched the swaying hospital room door and had an idea. I want to watch them fall from their own webs of deceit, from great heights to heavy falls!

But a month later, when I was discharged, I received a call from a teammate.

"Sister Nora, something’s wrong! You’ve been kicked out of the racing team!"
