After some communication, a French team’s coach agreed to help me assemble a top-notch team. I was going to share this good news with Lachlan. But when I arrived at the training ground, I found the garage engulfed in flames.

I checked Lachlan, who was blocked outside the police line, from top to bottom. Fortunately, aside from being a bit disheveled, he was unharmed.

"What happened?"

"I don’t know. I was fixing the car in the garage when I heard a noise from the back door."

"But when I went to check, I only saw a figure running away, and then the garage caught fire."

Lachlan’s face was smeared black from the smoke, looking lost. But I knew in my heart, this was most likely Finn Beckett’s doing.

After Lachlan was taken by the police to give a statement, I decided to demand an explanation.

However, I was stopped at the gate by the manager of the former team’s training ground. He shoved me hard, completely lacking the previous respect and flattery. I was about to argue with him when Finn Beckett swaggered over.

"Oh, here to beg for mercy?"

He was smug, his eyes full of ridicule. Thinking of how he almost got the innocent Lachlan killed, I was furious.

"If you have a grudge, come at me! Why target Lachlan? Does human life mean nothing to you?"

"What evidence do you have to say I harmed anyone? Be careful, I might sue you for defamation!"

Finn Beckett poked my shoulder hard, his face full of a sleazy smile.

"How about this, come back and be my racing assistant, then I won’t..."

"You think trash like you deserves to keep working with me?"

I cut him off, and his eyes turned vicious.

"I see, you’re just asking for it!"

"I’m just waiting for you to exit the industry and crawl back begging me!"

I looked at his back, thinking, let’s see who begs who then. On the way back, I contacted the sponsors. Lachlan’s car was destroyed in the fire, and we needed new racing cars.

"You got any proof I harmed someone? Watch out, or I might just sue you for defamation!"

Finn Beckett jabbed me hard in the shoulder, flashing a sleazy grin.

"How about this, come back and be my race assistant, and then I won't..."

"You think trash like you deserves to work with me?"

I cut him off, and his eyes immediately glinted with malice.

"You're really asking for it!"

"Just wait till you're begging me to help you when you leave the industry!"

Watching him walk away, I thought to myself, who's going to be begging whom?

On my way back, I contacted the sponsors. Lachlan's car had been destroyed in a fire, and we needed a new racing car. Fortunately, all the sponsors are brands invested in by the Quinn family and are always ready to assist me.

Besides, I devised a brand-new plan.

Three days later, I picked up Lachlan and headed to the Quinn family's expansive private training ground on the outskirts. It not only had professional tracks but also various rally simulation terrains.

Lachlan's jaw dropped when he saw the training ground, the team from France, and the brand-new top-tier racing car.

"Did you arrange all this?"

I nodded and then announced my new plan in front of the entire team.

"Lachlan, you and I will compete in the race a month from now."

"You'll be the driver, and I'll be your navigator."

"Aren't you afraid I'll lose? If I lose, you'll have to leave the industry." Lachlan asked, surprised.

I just smiled and reassured him.

"No one knows you better than your opponent. After competing against you for the championship for so many years, who else is more suited to be your navigator?"

After hearing this, Lachlan also smiled.

"Then I'm counting on you, my navigator."

Training commenced quickly. Lachlan's driving skills didn't disappoint me, and I was indeed well-suited to be his navigator.

Turning, accelerating, braking—every move he made affecting the car was just as I expected.
