Five years. Five years of marriage, and I’d never spent the holidays back in Brett’s hometown. My career, building The Pinnacle Group into what it is today, always seemed to demand it.
Out of guilt—a deep, persistent ache that whispered I was a bad wife—this year, I’d booked a twenty-thousand-dollar luxury tour for his parents, Robert and Martha Donovan, so they could have a festive season without me. I'd instructed Brett to take them.
But on Christmas Eve, Robert and Martha suddenly walked into my penthouse office.
“Caroline Wells,” Robert started, his voice a low growl that carried the resentment of half a decade. “We accepted you skipping five Christmases. But how dare you keep Brett from his family, too?”
My jaw dropped. I was genuinely stunned.
Before I could even formulate a coherent defense, a text message from Brett popped up on my phone.
“Babe, we just checked into the Grand Met! Don’t worry, Mom and Dad are thrilled. They even said you’re the most thoughtful daughter-in-law.
P.S. You might see a charge for discretionary items at the hotel pop up. Don't ask. You know how my parents are—they’re old-fashioned about that stuff…”
I lowered the phone and looked up at Robert and Martha, bewildered.
“Does Brett have… other parents?” I asked.
The answer came instantly. Brett’s face popped up on Robert’s phone—a panicked, incoming call. Robert answered on speaker.
A woman’s voice, husky and annoyed, immediately filled the sterile silence of my office.
“Dad, what are you doing calling right now? Brett and I are seriously busy for the holidays! We’ll get back to you after the New Year!”
Robert’s eyes, already wide with indignation, stretched further, like two hard-boiled eggs. “Brett has another wife?” he boomed.


The woman on the phone complained, a sound of exasperation. “Dad, it’s Caroline! How can you not recognize your own daughter-in-law’s voice?”
Robert glanced at me, then back at the phone, a look of pure, unadulterated confusion etched on his face. The look clearly asked: If she’s Caroline, who the hell are you?
Brett’s voice, slightly breathless, then came through.
“Dad, I told you, it’s the same rule as always. I’m not coming home for Christmas. Caro and I are occupied. Don't cause trouble.”
I was completely numb. My first instinct was to snatch the phone and demand an explanation, but the line went dead.
Robert and Martha looked at each other, then at me.
“Look… maybe there’s been some kind of misunderstanding?” Martha offered weakly.
I was done with misunderstandings. My face went cold. I instantly told my assistant to book the soonest flight to the city where Brett had checked into the Grand Metropolitan Hotel.
On the flight, Robert and Martha tried every convoluted excuse to defend their son. But my carefully phrased questions confirmed the terrifying truth I already suspected: Brett hadn’t been home in five years.
And not only had he lied, but they hadn’t received a single one of the expensive holiday gifts or the generous cash bonuses I’d been sending, which explained why they always seemed to hold me in such low regard.
When we arrived at the hotel, I used the transaction information to locate Brett’s room.
I knocked. A woman in a thick terrycloth robe opened the door.
“Room service already? Did my lingerie delivery get here?” she asked, sounding impatient.
Then she saw Robert and Martha, and her brow instantly furrowed. “What’s this? Wrong room, old people.”
Robert didn't hesitate. He started to shove past her. “Where is Brett? Tell him to get out here right now!”
The woman spotted me, her eyes flashing for a split second, then she stepped out and slammed the door behind her with unnecessary force. The movement was so rough that Martha, who was right behind Robert, stumbled and fell to the carpet. I bent down quickly to help her up.
“Where did these two fossils come from? The sheer nerve!” she spat. “Security? Get these lunatics out of here!”
Robert was crimson-faced, screaming back at her.
But a memory, long filed away and forgotten, suddenly surfaced in my mind.
I knew this woman.
Five years ago, before we were married, Brett drove home for Thanksgiving. She was sitting in the passenger seat. He told me she was his cousin, Vanessa, and he was just giving her a lift home.
I even remember giving her a high-end cosmetic kit and a generous cash envelope, telling Brett to take good care of his "little cousin" on the drive.
Vanessa Shaw’s response, in retrospect, was chillingly weird.
“We’re family, through and through. Brett will always take good care of me, Caroline.”
While I stood there frozen, lost in the memory.
Slap!
Vanessa unceremoniously smacked Robert right across the face.
“Have you finished your temper tantrum, old man? Who gave you the right to curse at me? My husband is the VP of The Pinnacle Group! One word from me and you’re finished!”
Robert staggered, clutching his stinging cheek, his face a mask of disbelief.
I was beyond fury—I was laughing, a cold, empty sound. “A vice president in name only. Who gave him the right to act so arrogant?”
I pointed at the door. “Now, bring Brett out here! I want to see if he has the guts to stand here and admit he’s your husband!”
Vanessa just smirked, a sliver of malice in her eyes. “And who are you? You think you can just summon my husband? Get lost. He’s cleaned up and waiting for me in bed. He doesn’t have time for your trash.”
A squad of uniformed security guards suddenly appeared, sprinting down the hall. Vanessa’s expression turned triumphant.
“Get them out! Immediately!” she ordered.
“My husband is finally on vacation. He’s been holding it in for months, and he nearly killed me in there. If you ruin his mood, you’ll pay for it!”
Robert and Martha couldn’t take it anymore. They lunged at her, desperate to silence her before she said anything else to provoke me.
Vanessa shrieked. “They’re attacking me! You two old fools, how dare you! Hit them! Beat them! I’ll cover any consequences!”
The guards exchanged a look. “Mr. Donovan of Pinnacle is a Super VIP! Who are you to assault his wife?” They rushed forward, swinging their rubber batons.
Even though I threw myself in front of them, Robert and Martha were struck repeatedly, collapsing to the floor, blood trickling from their heads.
Vanessa was practically vibrating with pleasure. “And that bitch! She’s the mastermind!”
I was frantic. I reached into my coat for my wallet, pulling out my identification.
“Stop! I am Brett Donovan’s legal wife! And these two are his parents!”
The guards hesitated, their weapons momentarily lowered.
But before the security captain could take my ID and check it, Vanessa snatched the baton from his hand and slammed it down hard on my forearm.
My identification and marriage certificate scattered across the polished floor. I cried out, clutching my throbbing arm, backing away.
“She’s a shameless, crazy psycho! She’s been stalking and harassing my husband, telling everyone she’s his woman! Bitch, say another word and I’ll knock your teeth in!”
She raised the baton again, a snarl of pure hatred on her face, aiming for my mouth.
It was in that exact second—
“Ness! You’re insane! Stop that!”
The commotion had grown too loud. Brett, finally dressed in a pressed button-down, opened the door and stepped out. Other guests opened their doors a crack, watching the spectacle.
I clenched my jaw, fighting the wave of pain and shock. “Brett. You owe me and your parents a rational explanation for this.”
Meeting my eyes, Brett’s gaze flickered away. He wouldn’t look at me.
“Okay, everyone disperse. This is just a simple misunderstanding!” he announced dismissively.
I couldn’t help the cold, brittle laugh that escaped my lips. “A misunderstanding? Brett, how dare you even say that out loud?”
Vanessa’s reaction was even more dramatic. She grabbed Brett’s arm and clung to it.
“Honey, what is this? You’re not saying you have some dirty secret with this crazy tramp, are you?”
The onlookers started whispering, pointing, trying to decide which woman was the shameless third party.
Brett forced a smile for Vanessa. “Nonsense, darling. I just don’t think it’s good luck to have a spectacle like this during the holidays!”
He then strode over to me and grabbed my injured arm. I gasped, sucking in a sharp breath of pain, which he completely ignored.
“Caroline, stop this. I’ll explain everything later. Everyone is watching. You don't want rumors flying around and hurting the company’s image, do you?”
I ripped my arm out of his grasp. “You weren’t worried about image when you were cheating! I don’t need to wait. Tell everyone. Right now. In front of all these witnesses.”
Brett’s brows knitted in anger, his voice dropping to a harsh whisper. “Stop being so dramatic and immature!”
“It is just a misunderstanding. Why do you have to be like this? I was just taking my parents and my cousin on a trip. Ness was just joking. You’re being so irrational, you’ll ruin her reputation! How will she face people?”
I looked at him as if he were an idiot. “What nonsense are you spewing? Say that again—in front of your parents.”
Even now, he was trying to lie. A "cousin" who sleeps in the same room and calls him "husband"? And his parents…
Brett’s face hardened. “Caroline Wells, you brought this on yourself!”
He snapped his fingers at the guards. “Grab those two old people and drag them away! Hold them somewhere secure!”
Then he took Vanessa’s hand, holding it high.
“I want to make an official statement: This woman is my wife!”
He then pointed at me. “As for this lunatic… she is a desperate gold-digger who has been obsessed with me for years! I have rejected her advances countless times, but she keeps stalking me. This time, she tracked my wife and me down to try and ruin our marriage with lies!”
The crowd erupted in noise.
“Unbelievable! I’ve never seen a woman so shameless!”
“She was stalking him? And brought her own parents to cause a scene? That whole family is disgusting!”
“What a scheme. If I were Mrs. Donovan, I would definitely be confused.”
Brett then looked back at me, his eyes cold. “Caroline. Are you finished with your little tantrum? Don’t say I didn’t warn you. If you harass us again, I won’t hesitate to call the police and have you arrested.”
I was shaking, but I took out my phone. “Call the police? Go ahead. Call them now! If you don't, you're a coward!”
Brett was momentarily speechless. How could he call the police?
Vanessa rushed forward and slapped me hard across the face. “Calling the police is too good for this deranged freak! I think she needs to be committed to a mental institution!”
Brett quickly recovered, snatched my phone, and slammed it on the floor.
He leaned in close, his voice a low, chilling hiss in my ear.
“Your parents are bleeding all over the floor. The situation isn't looking good. If they don’t get medical attention immediately, and something happens…”
He gripped my shoulder, his fingers digging into my coat. “Caroline, be reasonable. Stop the theatrics.”
I finally understood. He didn’t recognize his own parents. He thought they were mine.
“Brett. You truly are a devoted son.”
Brett looked uncomfortable but ground his teeth. “What kind of passive-aggressive garbage is that? You forced my hand! I told you, it’s a misunderstanding! Don’t you have an ounce of faith in me? How can I face our relatives back home if you humiliate me like this?”
I wanted to scream: Faith? Haven’t I given you enough faith?
I wanted to tell him that the parents he claimed to be traveling with had just been dragged away like dead dogs.
Before I could speak, a group of patrol officers, drawn by the disturbance, arrived.
“What is going on here?” the lead officer demanded.
I found my voice, shouting over the din. “Officer, I need to report a crime! I am Brett Donovan’s legal wife. He is committing adultery, and he just had my family and me assaulted and beaten by hotel security!”
The officer looked skeptically at me, then turned to Brett. “Are you Brett Donovan? Is what she’s saying true?”
Brett scoffed. “Don't listen to her, Officer! This woman is mentally unstable. We have no relationship whatsoever! Don't believe a single word she says!”
“Brett! You can lie about me, but what about your parents? Do you not care if they live or die?”
Robert and Martha had always been lukewarm toward me. But then again, I hadn't seen them in five years, nor had they received any of my attempts at compensation. The fact that they rarely complained was a testament to their character. Most importantly, their injuries were severe. I didn’t want anyone dying on Christmas Eve.
“My ID and marriage license are on the floor! Please, don’t take this lightly. It’s a matter of life and death!”
But just then, another couple, around sixty years old, rushed out of the room next door, followed by a small boy, maybe four years old.
“You filthy tramp! How dare you lie like that?” the older woman yelled. They both claimed to be Brett’s in-laws.
The little boy, his face contorted in a toddler’s scowl, ran up to me. “You bad lady, you hurt my mommy! I’m gonna hit you!”
Brett gently scooped the boy into his arms. “Mason, stay away from this crazy woman! She might be violent!”
Seeing the little boy, who bore a clear, unsettling resemblance to Brett, silenced me completely.
Brett glared at me, triumphant. “See? These are my true in-laws! And that child is their grandson!”
“Your parents' lives? Why the hell would I care?”
The hotel security, Vanessa's parents, and the boy all stood by Brett, creating the perfect image of a loving, wronged family.
The lead officer looked down at the shredded marriage certificate and seemed uncertain. “Ma’am, do you have any other evidence to prove your relationship with Mr. Donovan?”
I opened my mouth to speak.
Brett leaned in and whispered his final warning.
“Do you really not care if your parents die?”
My words caught in my throat. I stared at him with cold fury. “Are you threatening me with the lives of two old people?”
Brett sneered. “It's not a threat. It’s me asking you to calm down before you make things worse. If your stubbornness causes them to die, it will be entirely your fault.”
I stood there, defeated. After a long moment, I managed a cold smile.
“Brett and Vanessa are right. I am a crazy woman.”
“Please, don’t hold my lunatic behavior against me.”
“Officers, I am prepared to take full responsibility for my actions. Please take me to the station for questioning.”
Brett nodded, visibly pleased with my sudden compliance. But when I finished the sentence, he quickly interjected. “Officers, an arrest isn’t necessary! It’s the holidays, and I don’t want to waste resources or make a scene at the station over this petty matter.”
“We’ll settle this privately!”
Vanessa quickly agreed. “That’s right! It’s nothing major! I see women like this—shameless gold-diggers—all the time. They just want a little money to go away. We can handle it.”
“Please continue your patrol. We’ll take care of this ourselves.”
I shook my head. “No. I am a criminal and I deserve to be taken in. But I have one demand.”
“Until my parents show up, I will not say another word.”
I was referring to my actual mother and father, who were rushing to the scene.
Brett, mistaking this as a desperate concession, signaled to the police that he needed to speak with me privately. He dragged me into a corner.
“What’s this? Playing hardball now? If you don’t agree to settle, you’ll never see your parents again!”
“Unless I give the word, those two old people could die without being seen or heard from again! Try me if you don’t believe it!”
I gave him a mirthless smile. “Is that so? Are you truly that heartless? They always treated you well.”
Brett frowned. “You think I won’t?”
He quickly made a gesture, and a recording of a terrible, high-pitched scream echoed from his phone.
“Caroline, why do you have to push me?” he demanded.
He intentionally raised his voice on the last sentence. “I’m asking you one last time: Are you going to agree to settle this privately?”
Before I could answer, a familiar voice, followed by the stampede of heavy footsteps, reached us.
“We do not agree!”
Hearing my parents’ voices, Brett’s eyes bugged out.
“No, wait… you… how are you here?”
