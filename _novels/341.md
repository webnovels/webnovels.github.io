To help my wife, Chloe, settle the crushing debts from her disastrous investments, I agreed to her unthinkable proposal: to sell my kidney.

But on the day of the surgery, our six-year-old son, Leo, raced to the clinic by himself, frantically calling his mother for help.

Chloe's voice was strained. "Daddy's just giving up one kidney, Leo. It'll buy Mommy peace for the rest of her life. If he doesn't, Mommy's life is ruined."

Leo still objected, but Chloe simply hung up.

Turning away, she anxiously walked towards a high-end private room nearby, gazing at her pale first love, Ryan, soothing him in a low voice.

"Don't worry," she whispered. "The kidney source is here. You'll be fine soon."

"Don't blame yourself. I chose to lie to him. He's still young anyway; one less kidney won't matter."

Later, Chloe's first love had a successful surgery. Chloe was in high spirits, uncharacteristically suggesting a trip, a 'honeymoon' for me, her, and Leo.

But she didn't know. I was already dead.

Because on the day of the kidney removal, I couldn't afford the crucial post-operative antibiotics, and the wound infection claimed my life.

And Leo? He had completely given up on her.
