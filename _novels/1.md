My brother is a psychopath.
He's bipolar, and when he tried to stop me from marrying my fiancé, he broke his own leg.
Later, I was murdered—betrayed by my fiancé and my best friend, who had plotted together to kill me.
On the day of my funeral, while I lay six feet under, they celebrated, laughing and planning how to spend my inheritance.
My brother, with his broken leg and all, chased them across the globe like a man possessed.
Covered in blood, he dragged their severed heads back to my grave.
He cradled my corpse, his fingers brushing my hair, and whispered softly:
"Don't worry, kiddo. Your big brother's always here."
Now I've been given a second chance.
When my fiancé wrapped his arms around me and asked me to drug my brother's water, I shoved that disgusting man away.
"What's wrong with my brother?"
"He's just a little too good at loving me."
