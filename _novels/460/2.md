In the middle of the night, I was awakened by a nightmare. I looked to the side and found no one there.
Feeling uneasy, I decided to go out and take a look.
As I passed through the living room, I heard voices.
It was Lucas's voice.
What was he doing up at this hour?
I quietly hid behind a pillar and saw candles burning in the room, casting Lucas's shadow on the window.
I saw him holding a knife, stabbing downwards quickly.
I heard a muffled thud, followed by a splash of blood on the window.
A patch of crimson, with a faint smell of blood in the air.
In that instant, fear swept over me. The scene from earlier flashed in my mind - Lucas was killing someone!
I suppressed the terror in my heart, hiding there not daring to make a sound.
Then I saw Lucas hack down again, and another splash of blood spurted out.
My heart was pounding violently. I wanted to call the police with my phone, but then remembered I had left it in the bedroom.
I was about to sneak back to the room when I turned around and saw his mother standing expressionless behind me, who knows how long she had been watching.
"Where are you going, Mia?"
