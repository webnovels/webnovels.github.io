I was terrified, my whole body trembling. I managed to force a stiff smile.
"Oh, I was just going to the bathroom."
As I said this, I instinctively looked back and saw Lucas's hawk-like eyes staring at me unblinkingly.
I looked at the knife in his hand, my back already damp with cold sweat.
I was debating whether to cry for help when Lucas suddenly frowned, quickly walked over and felt my forehead.
"You look so pale, are you running a fever?"
I swallowed hard, looking at his concerned expression, unable to reconcile it with his actions of killing someone.
After hesitating, I finally spoke up.
"What were you... doing just now?"
Lucas seemed confused for a moment, then took my hand and led me into the room.
As soon as we entered, I saw a dead pig tied to a bench, several knife wounds on its body, the air thick with the smell of blood.
Even so, I breathed a sigh of relief.
I scratched my head awkwardly and asked sheepishly, "Why are you butchering a pig in the middle of the night?"
His mother smiled kindly, taking out a piece of pig liver from a basin and handing it to me.
"It's because we saw you weren't feeling well and thought you needed some nourishment."
I looked at her gnarled hands stained red with blood, feeling somewhat uncomfortable.
I realized it was all a misunderstanding. I smiled awkwardly and left, my heart filled with gratitude.
I didn't see the smiles on Lucas and his mother's faces turn cold the moment I turned my back.
