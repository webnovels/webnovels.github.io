"When my fiancée, Ashley, came to pay the ransom for me and my half-brother, Cody, the kidnappers changed the deal at the last minute.

They told her she had to choose one of us.

After a lot of back and forth, she picked me.

When we finally got Cody back, he was messed up bad. He was in the hospital for a month, and the doctors said he couldn't have kids.

Later, Ashley and my dad felt super guilty about it. They acted like Cody being a bastard didn't matter and made him the heir to the family company.

After we got married, Ashley wasn't into me anymore. She even wanted to let Cody adopt our future kid.

I was like, ""No way!"" She snapped back, ""We owe this to Cody. You have to pay for what happened forever.""

I used to be Mr. Golden Boy, but I became a nobody in my own family. Then, I caught Ashley and Cody together, doing the nasty.

I went crazy and started fighting Cody. Ashley knocked me out with a vase. Then they tossed me off the balcony and made it look like I was depressed and killed myself.

Then I woke up, and I was back at the ransom exchange.

This time, it's my turn to choose."
