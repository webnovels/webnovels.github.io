On New Year's Day, my husband Liam Reed posted a family photo online.

But in the picture, Liam stood in the center with his arm around his intern, Chloe. I was nowhere in it.

"We should get a divorce," I told him.

He barely glanced up. "Over a photo? How long are you going to sulk this time?"

Three years of marriage, and he still didn't believe I'd actually leave.

But this time, I was serious.

Minutes earlier, I'd gotten a text from Leo Sterling, the biggest movie star in the world.

"Wrapping up my show. Flying in to get you. ETA around midnight."

I immediately typed back, "Okay."

...


On New Year's Day, Liam insisted on bringing his intern, Chloe, to his parents' house.

All the family were gathered for lunch when someone suggested a family photo. Without a pause, Liam nudged me out of the frame and told me to take it instead.

He arranged everyone, then pulled Chloe to stand right beside him.

It was a family photo of over a dozen people, and I was the only one missing.

Seeing how upset I was, Liam signed. "Fine, I'll delete it. Happy now?"

"Can you send it to me first?" Chloe cut in, settling into the seat next to Liam as if it were hers.

She noticed my grim expression and immediately asked, "What's wrong? Liam, did you make Daisy mad again?"

Liam pursed his lips but didn't say anything.

Chloe quickly chimed in, "Daisy, don't be mad at him. I should have been the one taking the picture."

I let out a cold laugh. "You're so fond of my husband, you even have to show up at my family's holiday gathering. You can have him."

Chloe bit her lip, tears welling in her eyes. "How can you say that? You've misunderstood. There's a blizzard back home, all transportation is cut off. I can't go back."

Liam shot me a reproachful glance. "Take your anger out on me. Why are you picking on her? If you want a divorce, fine, but don't drag others into it."

Liam patted Chloe's shoulder and took her outside for some fresh air.

Our conversations about divorce were always so casual.

That afternoon, I had a card game scheduled with Liam's old friends.

I didn't want our issues to affect everyone else, so I bit the bullet and went.

As I reached the door, my friends were already complaining about me.

"Is Daisy not coming? Did you two have another fight?"

Someone laughed dismissively. "She's mad about this? Well, someone has to take the holiday family photo, so they're not in it. Daisy is just too petty."

"Exactly. If I were looking for a wife, I'd prefer someone gentle and even-tempered, like Chloe. She's perfect."

Liam sighed dramatically. "What can I do? That's just how she is. I've spoiled her since we were kids, so I just have to deal with it."

Someone else laughed. "You need to be firm sometimes, or you'll end up completely henpecked, with no say in the family."

Chloe spoke up. "Daisy is truly so lucky. If someone pampered me like that, I'd never argue with them."

Liam's friends immediately started egging them on. "Then let Liam pamper you today, Chloe!"

"Really? Can you get me a New Year's gift, honey?" she asked playfully.

I heard Liam's cheerful reply. "I already had a gift for you anyway."

Then Liam warned everyone, "Jokes are fine, but don't say anything like that in front of Daisy, okay?"

I let go of the doorknob. The laughter inside sounded so sharp, so piercing.

Liam knew perfectly well that I disliked his ambiguous relationships with others.

He'd say he was afraid of upsetting me, yet he let Chloe call him "honey" in front of everyone and even bought her a holiday gift.

It was all because he was so certain that I'd get mad, then eventually forgive him.

But this time, he miscalculated.

A little while later, Chloe posted an Ins story.

"Received a New Year's gift from my boss! It feels so good to be spoiled!"

The photo showed their fingers intertwined.

I called my dad. "Dad, I want to spend the holidays in Chicago."

He paused, a little surprised. "Why the sudden change of heart? Aren't you going back to Liam's parents' place?"

I fought back my emotions, not wanting him to hear the sadness in my voice. "I miss you. I'm thinking of relocating to Chicago. I'll stay there with you after the holidays."

My dad immediately heard the disappointment, but he didn't call me out on it. "Your dad supports all your choices. Do you want me to pick you up?"

Hearing my dad's loving voice, my heart finally settled. "No, someone's already coming for me."
