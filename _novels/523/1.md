I took a deep breath, trying to suppress the lingering trauma of my family's destruction in my previous life.

From the corner of my eye, I saw Tyler Brooks handing a bottle of water to Rachel Evans.

Rachel had been my childhood friend since we were kids.

The water was laced with a potent aphrodisiac - strong enough to make anyone lose control.

In my previous life, I had exposed this on the spot.

But Rachel didn't believe me. Instead, she thought I was jealous of Tyler's popularity and was stirring up trouble.

This time, I watched coldly from the sidelines.

Rachel took the bottle, glancing at me.

"What's with that look? Are you going to police my drinking water too?"

"It's none of my business," I said, averting my gaze.

Tyler, seeing this, started to stir the pot with a smirk:

"Jack Carter, aren't you being a bit too controlling of Rachel? Is she your girlfriend or something?"

A few classmates who were about to leave turned to look at me with strange expressions.

Rachel's face tensed up, her eyes filled with disdain as she looked at me:

"Who's his girlfriend? He's just a bookworm who only knows how to study. I wouldn't be interested in him!"

A surge of hatred nearly burst from my chest. I suddenly looked up:

"As if I'd be interested in you, Rachel Evans?"

Rachel was stunned, speechless, with tears about to fall.

Tyler seized the opportunity to mock me further.

"Still playing hard to get? Everyone knows you have a crush on Rachel."

"I just talk to Rachel a bit, and you get all moody. Tsk tsk, what a clown."

These words ignited Rachel's anger.

She always felt that being associated with someone like me, who was always buried in books, was embarrassing.

She glared at me fiercely, then defiantly drank the entire bottle of water in one go.

I tightened my grip on the pen in my hand, a dark light flashing in my eyes, and a smile involuntarily curling at the corners of my mouth.

In my previous life, with my interference, she had only taken a sip.

But even just that sip was enough to make her lose control, only knowing how to beg for intimacy.

Now, she had drunk the entire bottle...

A sense of anticipation crept into my heart, and I found myself looking at Tyler with a hint of admiration in my eyes.

It takes a villain to deal with another villain, after all.

I noticed a flash of triumphant glee in Tyler's eyes.

He put his arm around Rachel's shoulders: "Rachel, are you feeling unwell? Let me walk you home?"

Rachel shyly agreed.

About ten minutes later, Mike Anderson, the class monitor, burst into the classroom with a flushed face.

By then, only I was left in the classroom.

He was clearly anxious, mumbling something about "bathroom, bathroom..."

But he just couldn't get to the point.

I feigned ignorance and asked:

"Did something happen in the bathroom? It's not Rachel, is it?"

Mike grabbed my arm, his hand shaking with excitement.

"Yes, it's Rachel, and... and Tyler."

"Those two?"

I looked innocent and confused, as if I truly knew nothing.

There was a time when I considered Mike my best friend.

He had been my deskmate for all three years of high school, and we always had a lot to talk about.

But after the incident in my previous life, he was the first to step on me to climb up.

He publicly claimed that I had impure thoughts, and when my advances towards Rachel were rejected, I drugged her in an attempt to force the issue.

After I went to give my statement to the police, he even started a livestream, taking advantage of the hot topic.

During the stream, he seriously made up a lot of non-existent stories:

"When I heard this news, I was heartbroken. I've been his deskmate for three years, and I knew he had always had a crush on Rachel, but I never thought he would..."

"Jack has a strong voyeuristic tendency. He often secretly follows female classmates at night."

"I've tried to advise him, but he wouldn't listen. He wouldn't even spare a young widow who had just lost her husband..."

That livestream caused a huge uproar.

I was nailed to the pillar of shame.

The school also used this as an excuse to expel me.

Years later, at a class reunion, Mike had already climbed to a high position.

In his drunken state, he boasted proudly:

"It's a good thing you got into trouble, otherwise how would the spot for early admission to Harvard have fallen to me?"

Recalling this, my gaze towards Mike suddenly turned a few degrees colder.

In my previous life, I had gone to stop them.

But the truth was that Mike had me go to intervene while he ran to call for help.

In reality, he was hiding in the dark, secretly recording, quietly calling the police, watching me fall into an impossible situation...

Seeing that I wasn't in a hurry, Mike became anxious.

"Rachel is in trouble... Tyler dragged her into the bathroom! Rachel kept struggling... she must have been forced."

"Not necessarily, right? Aren't Rachel and Tyler mutually interested in each other? Maybe it's just a couple's game."

I said with a half-smile.

Everyone knew that Rachel and Tyler were very close, just a thin layer of window paper away from making it official.

Hearing this, Mike grabbed my wrist urgently:

"No way, we're just high school students, how can we do such things? Come on, let's go check it out, we must stop them!"

The calculation in Mike's eyes was barely concealed.

He couldn't wait for me to rush over there right now.

So that I would fall into an inescapable situation, allowing him to naturally snatch away the early admission spot.

I nodded and followed Mike downstairs.

On the way, I opened my phone and silently sent out a message I had prepared earlier.

The recipients were several internet celebrities who happened to be livestreaming nearby.

This time, I wanted to make a big scene out of this incident.

Tyler was the principal's only son, after all.

I still couldn't forget the look of disgust on the principal's face when he expelled me in my previous life.

I'm quite the helpful person, you see.

I wanted to let the principal see his son's "graceful demeanor" with his own eyes.

As we got closer to the bathroom, the lewd sounds coming from inside became clearer.

It was utterly filthy.

"Rachel, do you like it?" Tyler's voice, filled with heavy breathing, came through.

"I like it."

Rachel's voice sounded like she had little rationality left, answering purely based on desire.

Mike's eyes rolled, and he lowered his voice to say to me:

"Jack, it sounds like Rachel isn't fully conscious. You go in first to stop them, I'll go find help."

I smiled inwardly.

These words were exactly the same as in my previous life.

I pretended to be troubled.

"I don't know... This is the girls' bathroom. If I barge in and it turns out to be a misunderstanding..."

"Are you kidding me!" Mike glared at me, his eyeballs almost popping out.

He grabbed my shoulders and shook me hard, with a look of exasperation.

"Can you stop being such a coward! If we wait any longer it'll be too late. Do you want to watch Rachel get violated right before your eyes?"

The bathroom door wasn't fully closed.

Through the gap, I could clearly see what was happening inside.

Rachel's clothes were torn and disheveled, most of them pushed up to her waist.

She was clinging to Tyler like a boneless pile of mud.

Tyler's eyes were full of lust as he pressed her against the wall.

Tyler was still putting on an act:

"Are you sure you want to give it to me? Rachel, won't you regret this?"

"Give it to me, give it to me..."

Rachel begged like the most wanton prostitute in the world.

Tyler feigned reluctance, but his eyes were full of triumphant laughter.

...

I hesitantly agreed: "Alright then, you go quickly call a teacher, I'll try to control the situation."

Just as I was about to push open the bathroom door, I turned back to remind him:

"Make sure you hurry!"

Mike nodded and ran off.

After he left, I lowered my hand that was about to push the door.

I knew Mike hadn't run far.

Sure enough, five minutes later, Mike's sneaky figure appeared.

He had circled back.

I hid in the shadows and watched as he took out his phone and quietly slipped it into the door crack...

The people inside were getting more and more unrestrained, completely oblivious to heaven and earth.

After doing this, Mike left satisfied.

Soon after, Mike led a large group of people rushing to the teaching building.

The commotion inside hadn't diminished at all.

Mike covered his mouth, looking helpless and scared as he stopped the principal:

"Principal, I... I really... I don't know why they're like this? But as the class monitor, I couldn't just ignore it."

The principal was fuming, his nostrils flaring.

He didn't know the male lead inside was his own son; Mike had deliberately not made that clear.

I knew that in Mike's view, it would be best if both Tyler and I went down together, as we were both his potential competitors.

On a normal day, if the principal encountered this kind of situation, he would have already sent security to drag the people out.

But coincidentally, today the leaders from the Education Bureau were here for an inspection and hadn't left yet.

A group of leaders followed to "catch the adulterers in bed."

This scene couldn't be more spectacular.

The principal was so angry his chest was heaving violently. His promotion plans were likely going down the drain.

The more he thought about it, the angrier he became, wishing he could drag out the shameless couple inside and tear them to pieces.

Just as he was about to step forward, Mike stopped him again with a troubled expression:

"Don't go, inside... inside is... that person he..."

"I don't care who it is, this matter isn't over today!" the principal roared.

Mike seemed to give up, with a look of disappointment.

"It's Jack Carter. I tried to stop him, but he wouldn't listen."

The principal, of course, knew who I was.

I always ranked first in every exam and was the most promising candidate for Harvard among the teachers.

Hearing this, the principal's eyes bulged instantly, spittle flying as he spoke.

"This beast..."

The words were on the tip of his tongue, but he quickly swallowed them back.

The Education Bureau leaders were still beside him, so he couldn't speak too harshly.

The commotion inside was still ongoing, getting more and more intense.

Mike covered his face and fake cried, looking pained:

"Jack, how could you do such a thing! I understand you have a sex addiction, but you can't..."

With these words, the expressions of those around became even more unsightly.

The leaders looked at each other, sighing deeply.

At this moment, I walked out from behind the crowd, looking bewildered:

"Me? What about me?"

"Jack Carter, why are you here!"

Mike jumped like a cat whose tail had been stepped on, his whole body tensing up.

The principal looked at me thoughtfully.

"It's not you? Then who's inside?"

"I don't know, I didn't see," I shrugged, looking innocent.

Of course, I wouldn't expose anything at this point.

It was also at this time that the internet celebrities who had received my message sneaked in through the school fence.

"Oh my, I thought it was fake, but I didn't expect such a juicy scandal to really be happening at a school."

"You're teachers, right? Won't you let our livestream audience have a look?"

"Come on, tell us teachers, how did the students make such a big commotion? Is there an aphrodisiac in the school's tap water?"

I chuckled to myself.

There really was an aphrodisiac, wasn't there?

The principal's face turned black as the bottom of a pot, turning away in anger.

Mike stared at me intently.

The next second, he rushed over and grabbed my arm, lowering his voice to question me.

"Why didn't you go in?"

"Ah? I didn't dare. It was too inappropriate in there. I'm a good student, you know."

Hearing this, Mike raised his fist, about to strike.

But at that moment, the livestreamers' cameras turned towards us.

Mike had to forcefully retract his hand, his eyes full of venom.

The streamers happily waved their equipment around, filming everywhere.

The livestream comments were flying.

[Bros, this is too exciting.]

[Just from the sound, you can tell how shameless those dogs inside are.]

[Streamer, hurry up and go in to film! We bros have our pants ready to drop.]

The streamer seemed tempted but ultimately said reluctantly,

"That wouldn't be right. If I go in, my stream would be shut down immediately."

The Education Bureau leaders looked embarrassed at this scene.

One of them cleared his throat and instructed the principal.

"Davis, we can't just keep standing here like this. Go in and take a look."

The principal nodded grimly, his face ashen, rolling up his sleeves to charge in.

Just as he took a step, I rushed forward to stop him.

"Principal, don't go in. The students inside... their identities are special. If this blows up, it won't be good for anyone."

My words were full of hidden meaning.

The livestreamers caught on immediately.

"Oh ho, could it be the child of some school leader? That's some real power there."

Those leaders became even angrier, with one or two already storming off.

The principal, provoked by me like this, couldn't back down.

He angrily pushed me aside, "Get out of the way. No matter who's inside, I'm going to deal with this."

Mike seized the opportunity to chime in.

"Jack, stop interfering. Don't tell me you knew about this all along?"

He was trying to drag me down with them.

I didn't rush to defend myself.

"Class monitor, I just feel it's a pity. We're all classmates. If this gets out, their lives will be ruined..."

The comments in the livestream started to change direction.

[This student seems so kind-hearted.]

[Hey, don't stop him. Classmates like that don't need anyone covering for them.]

[Don't you guys think that class monitor seems a bit off? Like he's trying to stir things up?]

The Education Bureau leaders exchanged glances, all sighing.

In front of the cameras, forcibly barging in was indeed inappropriate.

What if the people inside really thought about doing something stupid because the incident blew up? No one could bear that responsibility.

Our group just stood there awkwardly, not too far from the bathroom.

The sounds from inside still hadn't stopped, intermittently coming through.

The streamers tried to get closer to film but were stopped.

This "catching in the act" scene lasted for nearly two hours.

Until finally, the bathroom door creaked open.

The first to walk out was a burly man dressed like a construction worker.

Seeing so many people, the worker was stunned for a moment.

Then he spat and said,

"What are you looking at? Haven't you seen someone use the bathroom before?"

The principal and other leaders, seeing it was someone from outside the school, relaxed a bit.

As long as it wasn't students, the situation could still be salvaged.

But the next second, someone exclaimed in shock:

"Holy crap, there's a huge bed inside!"

Everyone rushed over.

The scene in the camera lens left everyone dumbfounded.

Tyler and Rachel were naked, entangled with each other, with suspicious liquids all over their bodies.

Next to them stood several men who were putting on work clothes.

I recognized a few of them as workers from the school's construction site.

"This woman looks innocent, but damn, she's wild."

"That chick really knows how to please. She satisfied all of us."

The workers calmly put on their clothes and nonchalantly passed through the crowd, leaving with long strides.

Rachel, however, seemed to have lost her mind, still mumbling: "More, I want more..."

The drug's effect was really much stronger than in my previous life.

The streamers squeezed their heads in, clicking their tongues: "Now that's some real action, a group activity."

Tyler was startled by the commotion.

He hurriedly pushed Rachel away, covering his face while putting on his clothes.

The principal's face could no longer be described as just "ferocious."

His whole body was shaking as he pointed at the people on the ground, gasping for air,

"You two beasts, you're absolutely disgraceful!"

The principal didn't even consider that it might be his own son.

Tyler was terrified, desperately trying to put on his clothes.

Rachel was still in a daze, moving closer to Tyler, panting.

"Tyler..."

Tyler, as if disgusted by her, kicked Rachel away.

The eyes that were usually full of doting were now filled with revulsion.

I stood among the crowd, timely showing an expression of shock and heartache.

The principal started cursing at them, his words becoming increasingly crude.

Tyler curled up in a corner, tightly covering his face with his clothes.

Rachel was still not in her right mind.

Mike stood to the side, observing me with a complex expression.

He couldn't understand how things had turned out like this.

The Education Bureau leaders' faces were red, sighing and muttering a few words to the principal before leaving.

As soon as they left, the principal completely lost control.

He rushed forward and started kicking Rachel and Tyler violently.

"You shameless dogs, I'll beat you to death!"

Tyler screamed and dodged.

Afraid of being recognized, he didn't even dare to make a sound.

Rachel, still under the influence of the drug, lay on the ground moaning in pain.
