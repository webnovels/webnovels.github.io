Chloe’s voice grew softer and softer.

“What man would want a woman who’s broken like this? I just want to scare her, teach her a lesson…”

Liam looked at me, lying unconscious, and didn’t speak for a moment.

After a long pause, he said in a low voice, “Don’t you think that’s a bit much?”

Chloe burst into tears, covering her face, and ran off.

“Fine, I’m just too petty! She’s your wife, I’m nothing to you! Anyway, you saved me, so whatever! Next time, just let me die!”

The hesitation in Liam’s eyes vanished, and he immediately pulled her into a comforting embrace, his voice tender.

“Don’t talk nonsense. I can’t even stand to see you get a small scratch. If you died, how would I live?”

“Okay, I’ll do whatever you say.”

My consciousness faded, tears welling in my eyes.

When I woke up again, everything around me was dim, and I was lying on a bed.

Liam was helping to secure the plaster splints on my body.

He meticulously checked each connection for looseness, his movements gentle, as if afraid of hurting me.

Seeing that I was awake, he lowered his gaze and gently stroked the corner of my eye.

“Aria, I’m being targeted by my enemies. They want my life, unless you… go appease them…”

“Will you help me? I won’t mind.”

“From now on, you’ll be my lifesaver. I’ll love you forever.”

He let go of my hand without waiting for my reply.

Before leaving, he gave detailed instructions to the people outside the door.

“I’ve already spoken with her, she’ll cooperate. Don’t hurt her, and don’t turn on the lights so she won’t remember.”

With that, over a dozen men entered one after another, their eyes fixated on me with a greasy gaze.

I spoke to the man standing closest to me. “Can I borrow your phone for a moment?”

He sneered. “Calling for backup? Your husband already gave you to us to play with. Who else can save you?”

My eyes were vacant, and I spoke as if my oil had run out and my lamp was dim. “Not to make a call. I just want to glance at a certain social media account.”

“Just one look, please.”

I got the phone as I wished and searched for the “Dog Training Log” account.

I so hoped that everything I heard before I passed out was false, but the truth always stabbed me violently.

“Tricking my wife, who just woke up from a suicide attempt, into believing enemies are after me and she needs to repay their debt with her body. Will she agree?”

A new user commented below: “What happened to your wife? Why did she try to commit suicide?”

“Oh, she has depression. Just typical behavior for her.”

“Then why are you still messing with her like that?”

“She’s going to die sooner or later anyway, so what’s wrong with getting some entertainment before she does? If you don’t like it, leave. Nobody’s forcing you to watch!”

My left hand fell weakly onto the bed, my breathing becoming rapid.

It felt like a wire had snapped in my brain.

The severe depression I had suppressed for years finally erupted completely at that moment.

Extreme somatic symptoms caused my whole body to tremble uncontrollably, like I was having a seizure.

My vision blurred. I reached out and grabbed onto something, anything.

“Kill me! I want to die so bad! Let me die! Just let me die!!”

The men around me jumped in fright.

“What the hell is wrong with her?! Didn’t he say she was just a paralytic with broken bones? Is she sick or something?! I don’t want to be involved in a death!”

A man from the back pushed his way to the front, grumbling, “You guys are picky when there’s fun to be had. I love playing with psychos!”

“She wants to die, doesn’t she? Guys, let’s play her to death, hahaha!”

A cold sensation spread across my chest, and I closed my eyes in resignation.

Suddenly, the room door was kicked open with a loud bang.

A voice rang out:

“How is it that you’re always either being tricked, or on your way to being tricked?”
