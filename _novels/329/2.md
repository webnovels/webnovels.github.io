“What are you doing?!”

“Ms. Chloe has a gift for you.”

I was wheeled to the back door of a hospital room, and through the crack in the door, I could see the bed.

Inside the room, two familiar figures were tangled together, locked in a passionate kiss.

“I thought you were going to see your therapist? How did you end up here?”

“Little minx, you’re the one who seduced me. You look so hot in that nurse’s uniform.”

“Liam, your wife is still sick, you know.”

Liam grumbled, “Don’t even get me started. She’s got fractures, and I have to wait on her. She tries to kill herself every other day, she’s a total psycho. Chloe, seeing how pathetic I am, you’ll have to spend more time with me.”

Chloe giggled sweetly. “Okay, then let Nurse Chloe check what kind of illness you have?”

“Lovesickness. It’s a good session of loving you that’ll cure it…”

Their intimate whispers relentlessly pierced my ears.

I struggled to lift my only uninjured limb, my left hand, and clamped it over my mouth, desperate to stifle my cries.

I wanted to escape.

The wheelchair brake was right in front of me. I frantically willed my right hand to move, but I couldn't even lift it a millimeter.

I thrashed wildly in despair, tumbling out of the wheelchair onto the floor.

“What was that sound?!”

Chloe casually glanced at me through the crack in the door, then cupped Liam’s face, preventing him from turning.

“Someone’s outside, don’t worry about it.”

I lay splayed on the floor like a ragdoll, gasping for breath, tears streaming.

I don’t know how much time passed before the sounds from inside finally stopped.

Chloe walked out, her face flushed, and looked down at me, sneering.

“Sister, what a mess you’ve made of yourself.”

She helped me back into the wheelchair and pushed me out.

“Envious? Have you ever seen Liam so passionate? Do you know what positions he likes?”

“Did you really think he loved you just because he married you? He was just obligated to repay a debt.”

I screamed, indignant. “I don’t believe it! You have no idea what Liam and I went through together! You won’t trick me!”

Chloe suddenly burst into uncontrollable laughter, pulled out her phone, and tossed it onto my lap.

“Oh, you’re still proud, huh?”

“You, you’re just a toy for our amusement.”

The screen displayed a social media account’s record log.

The username leaped out at me:

**My Dog-Training Diary.**

The earliest post was three years ago.

“Tricking my love-struck girlfriend into believing I was accused of plagiarism. What will she do?”

“Update: It was hilarious watching her kneel in the office and take the fall for me, hahaha, so stupid!”

“She dropped out, and I got into a prestigious university with my research award!”

Then, a year ago, our wedding.

“What’s it like to ditch your fiancée on your wedding day?”

“A little boring, I smoothed things over with a few words the next day.”

“But, the first night with my true love was the best wedding gift.”

Then, last month.

“Tricking my devoted wife into believing my mom had leukemia and needed a bone marrow transplant. Guess if she’ll donate?”

“LOL, she was pregnant and took induction shots to donate cord blood for my mom. She miscarried with massive bleeding and still begged the doctors to draw more of her bone marrow!”

Every single entry, over a hundred posts, he had documented in clear, precise detail.

My fingertips whitened from pressing so hard, tears raining down like broken pearls onto the screen.

Unbeknownst to me, Chloe had pushed me to the hospital rooftop.

She bent down, helpfully scrolling to the latest post.

“Tricking my devoted wife into believing I crashed. What will she do?”

The latest reply was an hour ago:

“So funny, she actually jumped off a building to kill herself! Good thing she didn’t die, otherwise, this account wouldn’t have any more content!”

I had been so heartbroken for him that I wanted to die, still grieving even the moment I woke up, and I was just a fool.

Chloe savored my expression, her voice mocking.

“Aria, big sister, have you ever felt like your life has been particularly dramatic and exciting these past few years?”

“Those were all my ideas!”

Her smile slowly faded, replaced by a vicious snarl.

“But why didn’t you die?! You should have just died cleanly!”

“Now you’re still alive, looking like this ghost, and hogging Liam! Who are you trying to disgust?!”

With that, she slowly pushed me closer to the edge of the rooftop.

Seeing the height of several stories, I panicked and begged for mercy.

“I was wrong! I’ll never appear before him again, please don’t kill me! Please!”

A sinister voice echoed behind me. “Too late.”

She raised her hand, shoved me hard, and then jumped herself.

Suddenly, a pair of hands grabbed hold of us both.
