Nathan was ashamed of my stammer and never brought me into his social circle.
At a gathering with friends, his buddy joked, "How do you argue with a stammerer?"
His childhood sweetheart laughed and said, "It takes her three minutes to say one sentence. So stupid. Last time she couldn't get the words out, she almost cried from frustration."
Everyone burst into laughter. "Looks like he's not planning to make it official."
Nathan shrugged carelessly, "She's just a mute. I'll dump her when I'm bored."
Later, I appeared at a banquet on the arm of his older brother.
Speaking fluently.
Nathan grabbed my wrist and demanded coldly, "When did you get better?"
The man beside me put his arm around my waist and said with a smile, "Sorry, she's always been quite sharp when it comes to cursing."
