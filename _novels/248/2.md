"Mom, Dad, I won't be stubborn anymore. Can you please come back?"

I didn't want to wake up, my tears soaking the pillowcase.

Familiar footsteps approached the hospital room door.

"Riley, you don't have to make yourself look so pathetic. It won't make me feel sorry for you."

Seeing the scar on my forehead, his voice inexplicably deepened a few shades.

Serena, clinging to his arm, wore the smile of a victor.

"Riley, if you're sick, who's going to design Liam's and my wedding house?"

"I've been sleeping in Liam's room these past few days. You really do have good taste, the mattress you picked out is so soft."

I swallowed the bitterness in my heart, speaking calmly.

"I'll stay up all night to get your wedding house ready."

At my words, the triumph in Serena's eyes became even more evident.

Liam's throat bobbed, his expression darkening slightly.

"Take good care of yourself. Otherwise, how will you pay off your debt?"

His eyes were devoid of any warmth, leaving me unsure if he was genuinely concerned or just wanted me to get better to suffer more.

I smiled bitterly. It had to be the latter. He hated me so much.

He stepped out to get some medication. Serena's voice then grew smug.

"What kind of man would sacrifice his pride to personally get period pain medication for a woman? Liam spoils me too much; he just can't bear for me to be uncomfortable."

"He even has a notebook full of prescription formulas. Liam really does love me deeply."

I froze, remembering when I used to have period cramps.

He’d drive to the pharmacy in the dead of night to get my meds, then warm my stomach with his hands all night, barely sleeping just so he could make me a hot drink as soon as I stirred.

I'd once asked him if he felt embarrassed, a grown man personally going to the hospital for period meds.

Liam's tears had fallen onto my neck, searing me to the core.

"Riley, don't scare me. I thought you were seriously ill. I was so afraid, so afraid you'd leave me."

"I wish it were me who was hurting instead."

Only then did I realize that loving someone could make you shed tears before they did.

Seeing my blank expression, a flicker of anger crossed Serena's eyes.

She approached me with a smirk, then covered her face and stumbled back a few steps, tearfully complaining to Liam as he entered.

"Oh! Liam, Riley just hit me!"

I instinctively retorted, "I have a fever, I'm so weak, I couldn't possibly hit her…"

"Riley, I know you don't like me, but you can't ruin my face!" Serena's eyes welled up as she looked at Liam. "Liam, it's okay, I can put up with a little hardship for you."

Liam's gaze fell on my fever-flushed face. He watched me for what felt like an eternity before his voice deepened. "Don't play the victim. Get down on your knees and apologize."

Her face was smooth and unblemished, yet Liam had directly condemned me.

My pride made me stiffen my spine, looking up to meet his mocking eyes.

In that single moment, I crumbled.

"Riley, you claim you want to atone, but you won't even do this small thing?"

I glanced at the floor. There were thumbtacks Serena had just scattered.

But I still knelt down without hesitation.

The sharp thumbtacks dug deep into my knees. Every movement was like a knife twisting.

Blood seeped from my numb legs. I almost couldn't hold myself up, wanting to collapse.

After a long while, Liam tilted his head back, closed his eyes, and left with Serena in his arms.

"Stay kneeling all day. Come back and apologize to Serena when you understand your mistake."
