On the third day after my brother-in-law's death, I heard a man's heavy breathing coming from my sister-in-law's room.

I couldn't resist going to take a look.

The door was slightly ajar.

Through the gap, I saw a man in my sister-in-law's bed.

The man's silhouette was eerily similar to my husband's.

My heart suddenly leaped into my throat.

Earlier that day, my mother-in-law had suggested that my husband should father a child with my sister-in-law, to take care of her.

But my husband had firmly refused.

My sister-in-law also disagreed, saying she wanted to remain faithful to my late brother-in-law.

How did it turn into this by nightfall?
