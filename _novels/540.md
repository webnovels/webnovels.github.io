Seven years into my marriage, I was diagnosed with cancer.

After another coughing fit, I collapsed at home, blood staining my lips.

That very evening, Liam walked in, holding the woman he’d lost and just found again, his first love, Serena. He kicked open my hospital room door with a violent crash.

He shoved a kidney donation consent form directly into my hand.

“Serena’s condition can’t wait. You’re young, you’ll recover quickly. I’m begging you.”

“Don’t worry, I’ll cover all the surgery costs, and I’ll take care of you afterward.”

I didn’t cry out in pain. My hand fumbled, shakily signing my name on the paper.

The nurses outside looked at me with disdain.

“No wonder she holds her position as Mrs. [Liam's Last Name]. She’d even give her life for him. Who else could compare?”

Liam gently held Serena in his arms, tossing a line at me without even looking back: “After you’re discharged, I’ll take you to Switzerland to see the snow-capped mountains. Isn’t that what you always wanted?”

He had no idea my body couldn’t handle the surgery anymore.

I was destined not to make it to that day.
