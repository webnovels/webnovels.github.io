Lucas had been staying home to accompany me these past few days.

One morning as I came downstairs, I was surprised to see a busy figure in the kitchen.

"You're up. I made breakfast."

He set out toast and milk, pulling out a chair for me.

I gave a small "Mm" and started eating.

He wasn't annoyed, scrolling through his phone. "There's a concert today, let's go watch it together after we eat."

Just as we were about to leave, Lucas's phone rang.

With his hand on the steering wheel, he naturally turned to me and said, "Honey, can you check who's calling?"

That term of endearment made us both freeze.

I glanced at the screen - oh, "Little Puppy".

Lucas suddenly realized something and snatched the phone away, turning off the screen.

Tiffany kept calling persistently.

Finding it too noisy, I put on my headphones.

I watched Lucas answer the call, listening to what the other person said.

Then Lucas took off my headphones.

"I'll have the driver take you. Something came up at the company."

Watching his retreating figure, I felt a subconscious relief.

This was the normal Lucas.

The seats Lucas bought were in the front row. Apparently it was a solo cello recital by the famous performer Jason Jiang.

When Jason came on stage, I was surprised to find—

The gifted cellist was so young!

The young man sat down casually, his thin pale hands gripping the cello. Messy bangs fell over his high nose and thin lips.

Clear, melodious cello music echoed throughout the hall.

Someone quietly exclaimed, "It's so beautiful."

After the performance, it started raining outside.

The audience had mostly left. I was looking for a room to wait for the driver.

Before I entered, I overheard people talking:

"Jason, didn't the Jiang family forbid you from playing cello? I heard they even cut off your cards."

Another voice replied irritably, "Giving up is impossible."

The Jiang family.

Could it be the mysterious heir of the prestigious Jiang family?

I paused and turned, walking up to tap his shoulder.

"I'll sponsor you."

Jason scoffed, hands in pockets. "You're that rich?"

I pulled out several cards from my purse.

"This one has no limit, this one has some pocket money, about 3-4 million, and this one..."

I hesitated, looking up. "Is it enough? If not I can ask my husband for more."

Jason was visibly shaken.
