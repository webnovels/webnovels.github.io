When I was eight, I became the true heiress of the Chen family, treading carefully in my new home.

My parents favored the fake heiress, Tara.

Tara's childhood sweetheart was Lucas.

They were inseparable since childhood.

Until I appeared.

On the day the Chen family was busy celebrating Tara's graduation, everyone forgot my birthday.

I bought a cake alone and hid in the backyard to eat it.

When Lucas came, I was stomping on the unfinished cake.

He raised an eyebrow and said, "What a waste."

I glared at him. "None of your business!"

I ignored his intrigued look and ran off.

After that, Lucas would invite me along when he and Tara went out.

When rich boys teased me, he would coldly fight them.

When Tara drugged and framed me, he recklessly drove to save me, spending three months in the hospital.

On my birthday, he set off fireworks across the city for me.

He protected me so fiercely that everyone knew. People joked that he was protecting his "future wife."

He didn't deny it.

I believed it too.

So when I heard the Chen family wanted to marry me off to someone else, I immediately went to Lucas.

"Either you marry me, or you watch me marry someone else."

"Lucas, you choose."

That night, he coaxed me into losing my virginity.

Our fingers intertwined, skin touching skin.

As we reached the climax together, he bit my earlobe and whispered in a low voice.

"I, Lucas, will never betray you in this lifetime."

With the deed done, I naturally became Mrs. Chen.

He kept his word—

Flowers everywhere, jewelry worth hundreds of millions, and a wedding dress that took top designers five years to complete.

The guest list spanned political, business and entertainment circles. Luxury hotels across the city were fully booked, and the wedding venue was Lucas's family's private villa.

Faced with countless media questions, he only replied:

"Because she's Sherry Chen. She deserves it."
