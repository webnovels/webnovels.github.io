I thought the girl was simply provoking me.

Until the day I received a video she sent.

On a luxury yacht was a wild party of socialites.

The atmosphere was lively, the lights dazzling.

Lucas lounged lazily on a sofa. In the dim light, his expression was unclear. A girl's legs were draped over his, her skin glaringly white.

Everyone was chanting, "Kiss! Kiss!"

Lucas's fingers gripped the girl's chin as he leaned in to kiss her.

The next second, the girl started unbuttoning his shirt.

The phone suddenly fell to the ground.

My chest felt like it was blocked by a stone, pain spreading to my heart.

When Lucas came home, I showed him the video.

"Why? Why..."

I questioned him over and over.

In an instant, all the grievances rushed to my head. Tears rolled down like broken strings of pearls.

I looked at him with pleading eyes, tugging at his sleeve.

"Tell me what I'm doing wrong, I'll change, okay?"

"She made a scene in front of you?"

Lucas rubbed his brow. "I'll have someone take care of her."

No explanation, no comfort.

Lucas seemed to have watched a farce, unmoved.

I collapsed to the ground, sweeping the porcelain to the floor, hysterical. "Get out!"

Lucas sighed finally, trying to straighten me up.

"Sherry, you're the only one in my heart."

He pulled me into his arms. "No one can replace you. I love you."

My rationality returned as I struggled to meet his gaze.

"Then can you stop seeing other women? Lucas, please..."

"Be good, be sensible."

He continued, "Just focus on being Mrs. Chen."

Those light words.

Words like knives, cutting to the bone, stabbing my internal organs with pain.

That night, he took me several times.

Each time at the height of passion, he repeatedly promised in my ear:

"Sherry, I love you."

I felt my tears had run dry, not knowing how to respond.

After that, that girl disappeared.

When attending gatherings, different women were by his side.

Every time a scandal broke, he would give me a necklace.

Every morning I woke up afraid of not seeing him, yet afraid of seeing him.

I started refusing his touch, fearing smelling different perfumes;

I started fearing going online, afraid of seeing gossip about him and other women;

I started fearing calling him, afraid of hearing unwanted sounds.

On nights he didn't come home, I didn't know how I managed to keep my eyes open until dawn.

Some wives advised me, "Think positively, all men are like that."
