The thing high society has no shortage of is gossip.

The first time Lucas cheated, I was having afternoon tea with other wealthy wives.

They were chatting about which husband was hiding a mistress, whose husband took his mistress to the Maldives.

One wife sighed to me:

"I really envy your husband. He protected you so fiercely before marriage."

"Marrying him," I smiled shyly, "is probably the happiest thing in my life."

That wife smiled and nodded in agreement.

That girl showed up at our door that very day.

She had a high ponytail, youthful and vibrant, and extended her hand to me directly.

"Mrs. Chen, I'm Lucas's lover."

She spoke frankly.

"Lucas said he likes me best in bed, much more interesting than Mrs. Chen."

For the first time in my life.

I couldn't control my upbringing and slapped her.
