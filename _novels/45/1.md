Lucas didn't come home all night.

When he returned, I was enjoying breakfast.

A brand new Bulgari necklace was placed on the table.

"Sherry, a gift for you," he said.

I gave a faint "Mm-hmm."

Perhaps my reaction was too casual. He paused, then kissed my forehead. "Be good, I'm going to take a shower."

The sound of running water came from the bathroom.

His phone, left on the table, vibrated occasionally.

I unlocked it - the password was my birthday.

Inside were unread chat messages.

The other person was flirting with him.

[Pretty please, take me to Disneyland this weekend? I was so good last night.]

Lucas replied, [Let me see your chest first.]

The contact was saved as "Little Puppy".

The other person sent a photo almost instantly.

Pink, sexy lace.

I estimated it was an E cup.

I held the phone and sent a voice message to the contact: [He's in the shower.]

The next second, the phone was snatched away.

"Sherry, you're going through my phone?" Lucas questioned accusingly.

I looked up. "It's quite big. No wonder you like it. I like it too."

He stared at me, frowning.

"Don't talk nonsense."

"The young girl is innocent."

He fidgeted with the phone as it rang.

"Little Puppy" spoke with a tearful voice.

"Lucas, is Mrs. Chen angry? Should I explain to her?"

Lucas's expression turned sympathetic as he comforted her softly, "It's okay, don't cry."

I yawned, about to turn and leave, feeling bored.

A hand restrained me as Lucas gazed at me intently.

"You don't care?"

I was confused. "Care about what?"

His face suddenly darkened.

We stared at each other for a few seconds.

Lucas grew angrier. "Fine," he spat.

He slammed the door shut.

Faintly, I could hear him comforting the girl:

"Don't cry, you'll turn into a little flower dog. I'll come see you soon."

I glanced over.

There was a cabinet next to the door.

Seven shelves full of Bulgari necklaces.

Lucas's apology gifts over these three years.
