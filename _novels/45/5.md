"Little Puppy" was indeed different.

Lucas hadn't come home for two months because of her.

Compared to previous women, this could be considered doting.

But when I saw her in person at home, I was stunned.

For the first time, Lucas brought someone home.

The girl was as delicate as a flower, with a gentle and outstanding temperament.

In the dim morning light, I saw Lucas kneeling on the ground, tending to the girl's wound.

His movements were gentle, his face doting.

"Does it hurt?" he asked.

The girl shook her head. "Lucas, I'm fine."

Sunlight shone through the window onto them.

This scene made me unsteady.

The girl noticed me first. Like a frightened rabbit, she said, "Mrs. Chen, I'll leave right away."

Sensible, obedient, discreet.

Lucas held her back, introducing her to me frankly.

"Sherry, this is my new secretary Tiffany."

I nodded.

Then I heard him continue:

"Tiffany will be accompanying me to a charity gala later. You two have similar builds, let her choose a dress from your closet."

I looked at him in disbelief as I watched them go upstairs.

The closet was full of new seasonal styles.

Tiffany browsed through them before her fingers landed on a cheongsam in the corner.

She timidly asked me, "Can I try this one?"

I glanced over - this cheongsam was one of the wedding dresses from our marriage.

Fine silk, exquisite embroidery.

I had carefully put it away in the closet.

Sometimes I would take it out to look at, comforting myself that love hadn't disappeared.

Lucas once said, "This dress, only my wife can bring out its beauty."

I was about to refuse when Lucas directly handed it to Tiffany.

"Go try it on."

I suddenly couldn't understand Lucas anymore...

A few minutes later, Tiffany came out in the dress.

She did look good.

A slender waist, the neckline revealing ambiguous red marks.

Showcasing my husband's good mood last night.

Tiffany twirled on the spot, then sincerely said to me,

"Thank you Mrs. Chen, I'll wash the dress and return it after I use it."

"No need."

I refused, feigning composure.

Tiffany's face paled for a moment. She looked to Lucas for help.

"Sherry, what's wrong?"

Lucas sighed helplessly, patting my head. "Don't be petty, tonight's gala is important."

"No need to return it, I find it dirty."

I stared at him, enunciating each word.

The words were quite blunt. Lucas was stunned for a moment.

He lowered his eyes, seeming to realize something.

"Then I'll buy you a new one. Recently..."

"Okay."

I interrupted him. "Aren't you two busy?"

Lucas chuckled dryly.

"Sherry, are you chasing us out?"

"You used to be so clingy, cooking soup for me, picking out my clothes every morning. Now you don't do anything."

His words carried a hint of grievance.

Lucas, how should I tell you?

When I eagerly waited for you to drink the soup I made, you'd rather squat by the roadside eating dumplings with your new flame.

The tie I carefully knotted for you became a tool for bedroom flirtation.
