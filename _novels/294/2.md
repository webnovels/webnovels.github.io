I didn't see Caleb for the next few days. Through her Ins posts, I knew he was constantly by Seraphina's side. Expensive luxury goods flowed like water to her bedside. The giant screen facing the hospital was rented out, playing his blessings for Seraphina 24/7.

Seraphina even posted an update with a picture of their tightly clasped hands. "I'm the happiest woman in the world."

I said nothing. Under the sympathetic gazes of the doctors, I handled my discharge papers alone. Only that day did Caleb finally call. He demanded, displeased, "Where's the baby? Why won't they let me see them?"

"I haven't recovered, and you must be incredibly busy. I left the baby with my parents."

He caught the sarcasm in my tone. For once, he sounded a little guilty. "Lily, you've been through so much. Wait until I—"

I hung up without mercy. Caleb, I hope you're still as calm when you find out the truth.

Back home, I instructed the maid to pack up all my belongings. The scattered items were all memories of Caleb and me. There was the limited edition collectible figure he'd waited 12 hours in line to get me, and the good luck charm he’d prayed for at a temple when I first got pregnant.

But how could these tiny acts of affection compare to even a thousandth of what he gave Seraphina?

With a single fire, I burned them all to ashes.

I was planning to move abroad with Owen; the visa application takes five days. I just wanted to spend these last few days in peace. But Caleb wouldn't let me.

He suddenly burst in and grabbed my collar, choking me. "Lily! Where have you hidden Seraphina?!"

I managed to gasp out, "I don't know."

Caleb's gaze darkened. "You better actually not know! Otherwise, I won't let you off the hook!"

He threw me aside. I gasped for air, still unwilling to give up. "Caleb, do you even remember I'm your wife?"

Caleb's steps faltered. He hurriedly threw out an explanation, "Don't overthink things. Seraphina's mother asked me to take care of her before she died. She's my sister."

Then he left without looking back.

I laughed at myself, bitterly. In the past, even if I disappeared for half a month on a business trip, Caleb never bothered to ask. He really *was* worried about this "sister" of his.

I went to the embassy to submit my paperwork. When I returned, I found Caleb had already found Seraphina.

"Silly girl, why run off? If you're pregnant, just have the baby. I'll take good care of you and our child!"

But Seraphina stubbornly shook her head. "No! How could I bear to have a baby born without a dad?"

Caleb panicked, blurting out, "You're my legal wife! How could he be without a dad!"

A pang of sorrow hit me. I wasn't paying attention and stepped on a fallen leaf, making a loud crunch. Both of them noticed me then.

Caleb instantly flustered. "Did you hear something?"

I shook my head. "I just got back."

He let out a sigh of relief, then hesitated. "Lily, Seraphina might need to stay here for a while. Is that okay?"

I smiled, walking straight to my room. "Would it matter if I said no?"

"Lily!" Caleb couldn't help but raise his voice.

But Seraphina suddenly said, "Caleb, I'm a little hungry. I heard Lily is a great cook, could she make me something?"

Caleb looked hesitant. "Wouldn't that be a little awkward?"

Seraphina's mouth immediately drooped, and tears welled up. "I knew it, I shouldn't have come here to impose. It's okay, I'll just leave—"

Caleb immediately interjected, "Lily, you're the lady of the house, hurry and play hostess!"

Not wanting to cause further trouble, I went to the kitchen and made a dish for Seraphina.

When Caleb saw the dish, he paused.

Pork Rib and Pear Soup. A dish I’d once joked I’d make if we ever broke up. The word 'pear' sounds like 'leave' in Chinese, a subtle, bitter joke now.

Before he could ponder its meaning, Seraphina had already taken the bowl of soup. But after just one sip, she suddenly shivered and threw the bowl onto my chest!

I was drenched from head to toe, standing there, humiliated, while Seraphina innocently covered her mouth. "Oops, I'm so sorry, it was too hot... I just dropped it..."
