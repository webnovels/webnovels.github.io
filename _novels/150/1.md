Seeing Nora's smug face in front of me, I raised my hand and slapped her to the ground.

"A woman kept as a mistress dares to act insolent in front of me!"

My unexpected action stunned everyone there, and the room fell silent. My two uncles rushed forward to protect Nora, glaring at me.

They couldn't hide the pity in their eyes for their mistress who was slapped without warning.

Third Uncle was furious, stepping forward and shoving me hard.

"Lydia Johnson, who gave you the audacity to touch our niece!"

Looking at their faces full of disdain, I couldn't help but mock my past self for foolishly expecting any family affection from them.

I sneered, lifting my eyes to look at Nora contemptuously, taunting, "A mere mistress, and I, the rightful heir of Country A's Leading Conglomerate, the granddaughter of the richest man, don't have the right to discipline her?!"

Upon hearing this, my uncle flushed with anger and rushed over, pretending to choke me.

"Lydia, what nonsense are you spouting?! Nora kindly sponsored your education, and you repay kindness with betrayal!"

"Everyone listen up, Nora is my father's real granddaughter, the heiress of Country A's conglomerate!"

I was shocked at his audacity and angrily retorted.

"Second Uncle, she's just a woman you picked up from a nightclub. How dare you say she's a Johnson Family heiress and the conglomerate's successor?"

"Even when lying, you should know when to stop!"

Third Uncle interrupted me, trying to cut me off.

"Lydia, did you forget the doctor's advice to take your medication?"

Seeing this, Nora quickly chimed in, looking pitiful.

"It's all my fault. I knew Lydia had delusions and accidentally told her about inheriting the conglomerate."

The three of them twisted the truth, putting all the blame on me. For a moment, the media turned their focus on me.

"Lydia is indeed just a nobody sponsored by the Johnson Family heiress. No wonder she looks so shabby."

"Miss Johnson is so kind-hearted, not caring even when slandered by such a lunatic."

Then Second Uncle waved over Assistant Manager Luke from the conglomerate.

"Someone! Get Lydia out of here within a minute. Without my permission, she's not allowed to step into the company again!"

I glared icily at Assistant Manager Luke, who was leading the bodyguards towards me.

"Assistant Manager Luke, my mother assigned you to help me manage the conglomerate. Don't you recognize who the real heiress is?"

Luke paused, guilt flashing in his eyes: "This... I..."

Third Uncle, looking impatient, spoke sharply.

"Assistant Manager Luke, my brother is the future heir of the conglomerate. Do you dare defy him? Are you risking everything?"

Luke's expression shifted instantly. He spoke to me, pained:

"Miss, I'm just an employee. My whole family relies on me. I can't lose this job. Please, stop causing trouble."

Saying this, he gestured to the bodyguards to take me away.

Seeing a group of strong bodyguards surround me, I picked up a teapot from the table and smashed it on the ground.

"I'm not only the heiress of the Johnson Family, the granddaughter of the richest man, but also the sole successor of the conglomerate. I dare anyone to touch a single hair on me!"
