My father gave me a choice between inheriting the family's $30 billion trust fund or receiving a $1,500 monthly allowance. Without hesitation, I chose the $1,500 allowance.

I wasn't panicking, but my rich roommate was going crazy.

In my previous life, after I chose to inherit the $30 billion, my roommate stole my family's trust fund card and invited the entire class to Las Vegas.

Overnight, the $30 billion was squandered, the family business went bankrupt, and my father, in a fit of rage, died of a heart attack.

When I confronted my roommate about repaying the money, he hid behind my girlfriend with a pitiful expression.

"Jack, you can't blame me just because your family went bankrupt," he whined.

My girlfriend even kicked me, breaking my ribs, and accused me, "Jack Wilson, you're the one who spent recklessly and got addicted to gambling. How dare you accuse Tyler! Have you no shame?"

When I was about to hire a private investigator, our class president ran me over with his car.

My girlfriend and the entire class testified for him, insisting that I had intentionally thrown myself in front of the car because I was suicidal after going bankrupt.

When I opened my eyes again, I had returned to the day I was to inherit the family fortune.

On the eve of graduation, someone in our class suggested going to Las Vegas to celebrate.

"Hey everyone, let's go to Vegas for a graduation trip. I'll cover all the expenses!" Tyler's words sent a shiver down my spine, the pain of broken bones still fresh in my memory.

Suddenly, I realized I had been reborn!

As soon as Tyler made the suggestion, the whole class erupted in cheers.

"Tyler, you're the man! That's what being a rich kid is all about!"

"If we're going to Vegas, we have to hit the casinos! I've only seen them in ads, never been there myself!"

Tyler grinned, "Sure, let's go to the casinos then!" He then turned his gaze towards me and walked over.

"Jack, I heard your family has VIP status at the casinos. Can I borrow your VIP card? Let the class enjoy some top-tier service."

My face turned cold. In my previous life, the tragedy of losing everything began when Tyler asked to borrow my card.

Back then, under the pretense of borrowing the card, he secretly took the bank card for my family's $30 billion trust fund from a Swiss bank that my father had left me.

When the court called my phone to inform me that the company had gone bankrupt, I realized that the money Tyler had used to treat the entire class was my family's trust fund.

When I went to Tyler's house to demand repayment, he hid behind my girlfriend with a pitiful expression.

"Jack, you can't blame me just because your family went bankrupt," he said.

My girlfriend, Olivia, even kicked me, breaking my ribs, and accused me, "Jack Wilson, you're the one who spent recklessly and got addicted to gambling. How dare you accuse Tyler! Have you no shame?"

When I was about to hire a private investigator, Tyler deliberately ran me over with his car, repeatedly crushing me until I was dead.

Afterward, Olivia and the entire class testified for Tyler, claiming that I had become suicidal after going bankrupt and intentionally threw myself in front of the car.

My father also died of a heart attack due to extreme emotional distress.

I mechanically reached into my backpack, my fingertips touching the cold metal card, gripping it tightly.

Seeing no response from me, Tyler smiled and hooked his arm around my neck.

"Come on, Jack, just let everyone use it. It's not like you'll lose anything!"

"Sorry, that card belongs to my father. I can't lend it out casually," I said, stuffing the VIP card back into the deepest part of my backpack.

Hearing my words, Tyler's face showed displeasure.

"You're going to inherit your father's company anyway. Why be so particular about what belongs to who in a family?"

Olivia suddenly grabbed my backpack and dumped all my belongings out. My phone, game console, and tablet scattered on the ground.

Olivia immediately spotted the golden card and picked it up, handing it to Tyler.

"Here it is. Just take it and use it!"

As Tyler took it, he meaningfully caressed Olivia's hand.

"Olivia's so sensible. Jack, you should learn from your girlfriend."

Suddenly his eyes lit up, fixating on the game console on the ground.

"Oh, isn't this the latest Switch 2? I heard it's sold out everywhere. I've been trying to get one but couldn't!"

Noticing Tyler's eager gaze, Olivia bent down, picked up the game console, and stuffed it into Tyler's arms.

"Take this too. Jack's probably bored with it anyway."

"Thanks, Olivia," Tyler's face beamed with a smile.

I frowned and snatched back my game console and VIP card. "Sorry, I'm not lending either of these!"

Olivia immediately looked furious, grabbing me and scolding, "Jack Wilson, when did you become so stingy?!"

"Me, stingy?" I angrily slapped her face.

Slap!

The crisp sound of the slap echoed in the classroom. Olivia staggered back two steps, holding her face, her carefully styled bangs in disarray.

Her eyes widened in disbelief, the tiny diamonds on her manicured nails flashing irritatingly in the sunlight.

"Jack Wilson! How dare you hit me!" Her scream was like a cat whose tail had been stepped on.

I shook my tingling hand, sneering, "This slap is to teach you about boundaries. What right do you have to give away my things to others?!"

The classroom instantly erupted.

"Jack Wilson, have you gone mad?"

"It's just a game console, what's the big deal?"

"You even hit your own girlfriend!"

"Think you're all that because you're rich, huh?"

Tyler quickly helped Olivia up, then turned to glare at me angrily. "Jack, Olivia was just trying to do something nice for everyone. What's with your attitude!"

I bent down to pick up my scattered belongings, calmly putting the VIP card back in my pocket. "My attitude is very clear. I'm not lending anything!"

Olivia suddenly broke free from Tyler's grasp and charged at me. "Jack Wilson! You give that card back to Tyler right now and apologize to us, or we're breaking up! I don't want my boyfriend to be such a narrow-minded person!"

"Give it back? It's my stuff to begin with, who am I giving it back to?" I dodged her claws, a smile tugging at my lips. "If you want to break up, fine. Saves me the breakup fee."

This comment was like poking a hornet's nest. Olivia trembled with rage. "You... you think I care about your money?"

"You don't?" I raised an eyebrow, looking at the Cartier watch on her wrist.

"Then give back the birthday gift I gave you last week?"

Her face instantly turned pale, instinctively covering her watch.

The expressions of the surrounding classmates immediately became awkward.

Mark, the class president, suddenly stood up angrily, slamming the desk. "Jack Wilson, you're too selfish! Tyler is kindly inviting everyone to Las Vegas, can't you think about the group for once?"

"That's right," the study representative chimed in, "You always act so easy-going, but when it really matters, you show your true colors."

I looked around at these familiar yet strange faces. In my previous life, it was they who unanimously claimed in court that I had attempted suicide by throwing myself in front of a car.

"If Tyler is inviting you to Las Vegas, go ask him. Why are you coming to me?"

Tyler stepped forward again. "We're using your VIP card, so won't that raise your VIP status at the casino when we spend money there? It's a win-win situation!"

Olivia snuggled up to Tyler, the pain on her face seemingly gone.

"You're so considerate. Even after Jack has been so awful, you're still thinking of him."

"Since you all want to go to Las Vegas so badly..." I slowly pulled a card from my wallet, "I'll lend it to you then?"

Tylerend it's eyes lit up, reaching out to take it.

I flipped my wrist, revealing the full card—it was my student cafeteria card.

"You're mocking me?!" Tyler's face turned ashen.

"Pot calling the kettle black." I twirled the cafeteria card between my fingers. "Aren't you all trying to guilt-trip me too?"

Olivia suddenly grabbed the chalk box from the podium and threw it at me. "Jack Wilson! I must have been blind to be with you!"

I dodged to the side, chalk scattering across the floor.

Seeing that I wouldn't hand over the VIP card, Tyler's face instantly darkened.

He gave a look to the surrounding classmates, and several guys immediately surrounded me.

"Jack, don't push your luck," Tyler lowered his voice, his eyes sinister. "It's just a card. Do you really want to make this ugly?"

I let out a cold laugh, holding my backpack in front of me. "What, planning to rob me if I won't lend it?"

"Rob? We're just going to help you 'come to your senses'!" Mark suddenly pushed me from behind. I stumbled a few steps, hitting a desk. My backpack fell to the ground with a thud, its contents scattering once again.

Olivia stood to the side, a mocking smile on her lips. "Serves you right."

A few guys kicked my textbooks aside. One of them deliberately stepped on my game console, the screen cracking with a loud snap.

"What are you doing?!" I stood up abruptly, but someone firmly pressed down on my shoulder.

"Jack, don't be so stingy," Tyler said with fake sincerity, reaching for my pocket. "We're all classmates. What's wrong with borrowing a card?"

I slapped his hand away. "Get lost!"

This completely enraged Tyler. His face darkened as he suddenly grabbed my collar. "You want to do this the hard way, huh?"

The surrounding classmates, instead of stopping him, started egging him on:

"Beat him up! Think he's all that because he's rich?"

"Stop putting on airs. It's just a stupid card!"

Seeing that I wouldn't back down, Tyler swung a fist at my face.

I dodged to the side, grabbing his wrist and twisting it hard.

"Ah!" He cried out in pain, stumbling backward.

Seeing this, Olivia screamed, "Jack Wilson! How dare you fight back?!"

She rushed forward to claw at my face. I pushed her away and quickly pulled out my phone, dialing 91
