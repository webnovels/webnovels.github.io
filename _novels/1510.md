At fifteen, Adrian Hale helped me escape an abusive orphanage.
At seventeen, I was working in a VIP lounge in the city’s underbelly when I was dragged into an alley and nearly assaulted. He was the one who found me, who stabbed those men into comas.
On the day of his trial, facing a barrage of flashbulbs, he held his head high and said he had no regrets.
“I just wanted to protect the woman I love, Seraphina Monroe. I wanted her to finally be able to stand in the sun.”
At twenty-two, Adrian was released from prison. When he found out I was still a delivery driver in Aura City, he threw himself into the glittering world of high society and made me the richest woman in the city.
After we were married, he shared every detail of his life with me, publicly referring to himself only as “Seraphina Monroe’s husband.”
Then, at twenty-five, the grand casino we built together, The Empyrean, opened its doors.
I lit up the sky with a half-hour fireworks display from the Zenith Tower. But when I came home, I found ten empty condom boxes on the nightstand.
In the trash, there were stained tissues—the aftermath of their passion.
I kicked the disgusting evidence in front of Adrian.
But he didn’t even look up. He glanced at it with casual indifference and called for a maid to clean it up.
“It was just a game, Seraphina. Don’t take it so seriously.”
I laughed coldly and handed him the divorce papers I’d prepared.
“I never play games.”
Adrian swatted them out of my hand.
“We are never separating. Unless I’m dead.”
He had said those exact words at our wedding. It was the same promise we made to each other when we first escaped the orphanage at fifteen.
But now, ten years later, it was the dead of winter.
“We’ll talk when you’ve calmed down.”
He left.
The only thing left on the divorce papers on the floor was the print of his shoe.
A moment after he was gone, my phone lit up with two messages from an unknown number.
“Seraphina, can you just let Adrian go? You’re old news, a washed-up hag. You can’t even get a man excited anymore!”
“You must have seen the mess in the bedroom. I’m telling you, I’m the only one who can make Adrian happy.”
A series of intimate photos followed.
A woman, her shoulders bare, lay on our bed, her eyes smoldering with desire. Adrian’s back was to the camera, his muscles taut, his skin slick with a thin layer of sweat.
The tattoo of my name, which he had gotten on his arm just for me, was a glaring wound in the picture.
“See? Adrian’s true love is me, not you!”
“So I suggest you step aside. Otherwise, you won’t be keeping your position at the company for much longer.”
The woman’s taunts were laced with a naive arrogance, as if such a declaration of ownership could actually make me back down.
I laughed until my heart trembled. Then I went online and listed the millions of dollars’ worth of jewelry Adrian had bought me over the years for one dollar each.
When Adrian returned, he found me directing the maids as they packed everything away.
After a maid told him what was happening, his eyelids lifted slightly.
“They’re just trinkets. If you don’t like them, it’s good to get rid of them.”
I leaned against the window, a wine glass in my hand, and said nothing.
He walked towards me, his leather shoes silent on the marble floor. He took the glass from my lips and drained it in one gulp.
“She’s young and reckless, all bark and no bite. Is she really worth getting this angry over?”
He finished the wine and placed the empty glass back in my hand. His dismissive attitude made it seem as if I wasn't the one who had fought beside him through blood and fire to build our empire. As if it had been someone else.
I smiled faintly.
“You’re right. I shouldn’t be so petty.”
I tossed a stack of photos onto the sofa.
The girl’s face, a bloody, unrecognizable mess, was in full view.
“So I taught her a lesson myself.”
My voice was calm. The words had barely left my lips when a rush of air whipped past my cheek.
“Seraphina!”
Adrian’s hand was raised, his face contorted with rage. The slap stopped less than an inch from my face.
“Bianca is a model! Doing this… you’re trying to ruin her!”
There was no love in his eyes. Only a raw, burning hatred, as if he wanted me gone.
I stared at him, and for a moment, I was back in the rain-soaked alley at seventeen. I was working at a nightclub, and a group of men had dragged me into the darkness, tearing at my clothes. He had looked at them with that same expression, right before he stabbed each of them over thirty times.
The only difference was, this time, that look was directed at me.
“So?”
I crushed the wine glass in my hand. With my other, I grabbed his arm and pressed his palm tight against my cheek.
“Are you going to punish me like this… for her?”
Our eyes clashed, a silent, vicious battle. The metallic scent of blood filled the air between us. Only then did he see the shards of glass embedded in my palm.
“Seraphina.”
He flinched, trying to pull his hand back.
I didn't move. I just watched as he took my hand and began to painstakingly pick out the slivers of glass.
“I would never truly hurt you.”
“She was out of line. She deserved a lesson.”
He finally answered my question. A trickle of blood oozed from the wound, and he instinctively bent down, his lips covering the cut.
Back in the orphanage, when other kids hurt us and we had no medicine, we would “disinfect” each other’s wounds this way. Even now, he held onto the habit.
I pulled my hand away.
“Don’t. It’s dirty.”
Adrian froze. Then he called for a maid to bandage my hand.
And he walked out.
He didn’t come back for days. But my private investigators kept me informed. Adrian was with Bianca, taking her to the best plastic surgeons for skin grafts.
Within a week, she was back in the public eye, having landed five major luxury brand fashion shows.
When I heard the news, I went straight to The Empyrean to find him.
On the golden walls, massive LED screens played a loop of Bianca’s runway videos.
“It seems you really like her,” I said calmly. “You’re willing to give her the company’s top resources as compensation.”
Adrian’s lips thinned. He pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration.
“Seraphina, you hurt her.”
“As your husband and her mentor, it’s my duty to make it up to her. Why can’t you just let it go?”
I found it laughable. I pulled the divorce papers from behind my back.
“Sign this, and I’ll let her go.”
This time, he didn’t just toss the papers aside. He ripped them to shreds.
“I told you, we are never separating. Unless I’m dead!”
I knew he couldn’t let go of his obsession. Even more, he couldn’t let go of the empire we had built together.
I smiled, grabbed a nearby bottle of Lafite, and smashed it against the massive screen beside me.
Screams erupted in the lobby as people scrambled to get away.
When the entire ground floor was empty, I stared at him, my feet crunching over the broken glass.
“Adrian.”
I called his name softly, a trail of blood marking my path as I walked toward him. I raised my hand. The jagged edge of the broken bottle was pressed against his throat.
“Do you really think I don’t have the guts to send you to your grave?”
His pupils contracted. He grabbed the bottleneck, his knuckles white. I didn’t back down. I pushed it deeper.
“If you don’t agree to this divorce, I’ll send you on your way myself!”
My entire body was tense. I could see beads of blood forming on his neck.
But in the next second, he let go.
The sharp glass plunged into his throat.
Blood instantly soaked my hand.
He just looked at me and smiled.
“Seraphina, I will never agree to a divorce.”
He grabbed my hand, forcing the bottle in deeper.
“If you’re going to force my hand, then do it now.”
His tone was as casual as if he were asking what was for dinner.
I yanked the bottle back. A warm spray hit my face. The smell of blood filled my nostrils, thick and suffocating. I was dizzy, thrown back to that rainy night at seventeen. All the strength drained from my body. The bottle fell from my hand, shattering on the floor.
“Seraphina.”
A pair of cold hands steadied me.
“Don’t be afraid. I’m here.”
Adrian gently patted my trembling back, even as his own blood soaked his shirt.
He had held me just like this for fifteen years in that orphanage, trying to shield me from harm with his own frail body, trying to warm me with his own cold skin. He would whisper it over and over, “Don’t be afraid, Seraphina. I’m here.”
We had carried that love through twenty-five years of blood and tears.
And now, it was unrecognizable.
I pushed him away, forcing myself to walk. My weak limbs gave out, and I collapsed to the floor.
“Seraphina!”
He moved to help me up.
“Stay away!”
I clawed my way back to my feet and stumbled out.
After that, Adrian and I didn’t see each other. My sources told me he was recovering in the hospital, with Bianca constantly by his side. In her spare time, she managed to win an international modeling award.
I paid it no mind, focusing solely on running The Empyrean.
But Bianca couldn’t wait. She came to the casino to flaunt her victory.
“Seraphina, this award was a birthday gift from Adrian.” She brandished the golden trophy, her eyes glinting with triumph. “Did you really think scarring my face would make him leave me?”
She stepped closer. “Adrian’s love for me is real. The more you hurt me, the more he cherishes me. These endorsements and awards are just small tokens of his affection. What I really love is how much more passionate he’s become.”
I noticed then that she had removed the silk scarf from her neck. Her pale skin was covered in a constellation of dark red marks, each one a testament to the wild, unrestrained nights she and Adrian had spent together.
“You’re so pathetic, Seraphina.”
She tilted her head back, her face a mask of scorn. “I hear you and Adrian have been together for eight years and still don’t have a child.”
“You should get that checked out. It would be a shame if I beat you to motherhood.”
I smiled.
In the blink of an eye, Bianca screamed. She clutched her stomach and crumpled to the floor, her eyes burning with hatred.
“Seraphina, you’ll burn in hell for this!”
The curve of my lips widened. I brought the sharp point of my heel down hard on her face.
“Don’t worry. I’ll make sure you die long before I do.”
“Aren’t you afraid Adrian will hate you for this?” she choked out.
I pressed down harder.
“What happens between him and me is none of your business.”
That night, Adrian came home.
He had his men surround the villa, their presence a silent, menacing siege. An armored car was parked outside. He had only ever used such tactics when eliminating threats to our organization. I never thought they would be turned on me.
I opened the door. We stood facing each other, each of us flanked by a sea of bodyguards.
“Seraphina.”
It was the first time he had ever said my name with such coldness.
“Aren’t you going to give Bianca an explanation?”
“She came looking for a fight. I just gave her what she wanted. Isn’t that right?”
I descended the staircase slowly, stopping in front of him. The faint glow of his cigarette failed to illuminate his entire face.
“Did you really think I was as docile as the rumors say? That I’d welcome your mistress with a smile?” I exhaled a plume of smoke. “Adrian, don’t forget, half of everything you have is in my name.”
“The only reason I haven’t made this a public spectacle is out of respect for our history. But that doesn’t mean I’ll let some clown disrespect me.”
I held out the divorce papers again, dropped my cigarette, and crushed it under my heel.
“But if you sign this, I can let everything else go.”
The clouds blotted out the moon completely. In the darkness, I didn't miss the red glint in Adrian's eyes.
I sighed.
“For twenty-five years, you helped me escape that hellhole, you went to prison to protect me. In return, I willingly conquered half of Aura City for you, so you could be free to find your own happiness.”
“My debt to you is paid. Let’s part ways amicably.”
“Amicably.”
Adrian finally spoke, sneering the word.
His response was to snatch a lighter and set the divorce papers ablaze.
“I won’t let her bother you again.”
The flames died out.
He turned and left with his men, without a backward glance.
I stood there until his silhouette vanished, then let out a series of stifled coughs.
“Boss.”
My men rushed to my side.
I waved them away. “It’s nothing. The usual.”
To gain a foothold in Aura City, the endless dinners and drinks had taken their toll on my lungs. It was a chronic problem even the best doctors couldn't fix.
The cough persisted for days. I finally made an appointment at a private hospital, only to walk in on Bianca, in her room, threatening to kill herself.
“Adrian, you said you loved me! Why won’t you divorce her? Why won’t you stand up for me?”
“Don’t you know I’m ruined like this? I might as well be dead!”
She grabbed a fruit knife and tried to plunge it into her own chest.
Adrian blocked it with his arm. A long, deep gash opened up, blood pouring out. The knife clattered to the floor.
Ignoring his bleeding arm, he cupped her face and kissed her deeply.
A grotesque, desperate passion.
Just like eight years ago.
I pushed the door open. They both turned to look at me.
“Seraphina! I’ll make you pay for this!” Bianca shrieked, scrambling for the knife and lunging at me.
I twisted her arm behind her back and threw her to the floor.
Adrian grabbed my forearm.
“Seraphina, don’t.”
“Don’t what?” I laughed, a humorless sound. “You’re the one who said she wouldn’t bother me again.”
“I gave you the courtesy of handling it, but now she’s trying to kill me. If I don’t do something, you both might actually think I’m a pushover.”
SLAP!
The sound of my hand connecting with Bianca’s face echoed in the room.
That single blow seemed to shatter the fragile truce between Adrian and me.
He shoved me away like a madman, grabbing the knife and pointing it at my heart.
“Seraphina, if you touch Bianca again, don’t blame me for what happens.”
The tip of the blade tore the collar of my shirt. He stood before Bianca like a guardian, ready to fight her battles. Not long ago, he had sworn he would never hurt me.
“Are you sure you want to do this to me… for her?”
The hand holding the knife was trembling, but his eyes were resolute.
“Seraphina, you’re forcing me to do this.”
“I won’t let you hurt her again.”
I laughed. I truly laughed.
“Adrian, there’s no going back for us.”
Only when you’ve loved can the absence of it be so monstrous.
The Adrian of seventeen was gone forever.
