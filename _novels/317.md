My best friend got scammed out of seventy-five thousand dollars through an AI face-swap impersonating me.

She dropped to her knees right there in the public square, a dramatic spectacle designed for virality. She cried that it was her entire life savings.

She begged me to pay her back, claiming I was an influencer and made money easily.

The entire internet rallied against me, guilt-tripping me into paying her.

Even my own brother said Chloe was pathetic and blamed me for the whole mess.

I just smirked. Trying to get rich off my back?

Dream on!
