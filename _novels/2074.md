New Year's Eve. The train was hijacked by armed gunmen.

The lead hijacker shouted: "Whoever pays the highest ransom gets released first! The rest of you get blown to bits!"

I immediately transferred 50 million, desperate to buy two lives—mine and my daughter's.

But my husband, the train conductor, publicly crossed my name off the first release list to avoid suspicion.

He turned to me with feigned righteousness: "I'm the conductor, you're my family. Have some dignity! Give this spot to that boy with asthma medication!"

In my past life, I agreed through tears. My daughter was killed in the explosion.

This time, when my husband tried to cross off my daughter's name and replaced her with his illegitimate son again…

I screamed like a lunatic: "Give me back that spot!"

He had me gagged and dragged to the vestibule. For that bastard child, he was willing to sacrifice his own daughter's life!

Just as the boy was being released in the first group, his mistress—completely unaware—grabbed a megaphone on the platform and screamed hysterically:

"Hey, hijackers! The first kid has a bomb on him! The conductor planted it to blow you all up!"

She thought the first person released would still be my daughter.

"BANG!"

A gunshot echoed through the station.
