"Your underwear is pink today!"

My rival Jenny pulled open my collar in the classroom.

Classmates started whistling and taking photos.

But she just patted my shoulder:

"Don't be mad. We're both girls—it's just a joke~"

Later, she became even more brazen!

She'd pull down my pants when I wasn't paying attention, yank up my skirt. She even unzipped my skirt right before my master's program interview.

Later, I failed that interview. Under her constant harassment, I developed depression and took my own life.

When I opened my eyes again, I'd been reborn—back to the moment she was about to rip off my clothes.

I grabbed her wrist hard. Her bones made a cracking sound.

She cried out in pain:

"Let go! That hurts!"

I sneered:

"You're right—we're both girls. So how about I strip your clothes off instead?"


Her face froze. The laughter around us gradually died down.

She wrenched her hand free and stepped back:

"Are you crazy? I was just joking..."

"You just said you were 'messing around,'" 

I said calmly.

"So now I'm messing with you. What's the problem?"

Her face went pale. She quickly backed up and bumped into the teacher's desk.

"I—I'll apologize, okay?"

Her eyes reddened.

"It was just a joke. It's not like it's the first time. Why are you taking it seriously today?"

I slapped her across the face. The entire classroom fell so silent you could only hear breathing.

She covered her face, eyes full of disbelief:

"You dare hit me?"

I stared at her coldly:

"This is the last time you touch me. Want to try again?"

I looked around at everyone, raising my voice:

"She just pulled my clothes off in public. That's sexual harassment. I recorded it, and I'm taking it to the professor."

She looked at me in shock:

"You recorded it?! You actually recorded me?"

"Yes."

I nodded calmly, holding up my phone.

The red dot was blinking. Everything that just happened—all recorded.

From the corner of the classroom came whispered discussion.

"...That was pretty messed up, actually."

"What kind of girl strips someone else's clothes?"

"And it's not the first time?"

I pulled my clothes back into place, picked up my bag, and calmly walked out of the classroom.

Behind me, she called out urgently:

"Claire, don't do anything crazy,I was just messing around!"

I didn't look back.

This lifetime, I'm done playing your games.

That evening back in the dorm, her smiling face still filled my mind.

"Don't be mad. What's wrong with girls being a little close?"

I sat on my bed, still gripping my collar tightly. Even though I knew my clothes were fixed, I instinctively didn't dare let go.

My phone suddenly buzzed—a group message from my roommate Lisa—

My hand trembled, and the video auto-played.

The footage, shot from behind and to the side, clearly showed Jenny pulling my collar from behind, me stiffly covering my chest, and the whole class laughing.

The group chat instantly lit up:

【Her expression is so funny】

【Pink underwear is so tacky】

【I actually think it's kind of cute~】

I looked at the comments, my nails digging into my palms.

When I didn't respond, Lisa sent a voice message:

"Come on, Claire, you're taking this too seriously. Nobody meant anything bad by it. Jenny was just playing around."

"Didn't you say you were mature and didn't care about this stuff?"

I couldn't say a word.

That video got forwarded to the class chat, then to the school account.

A few minutes later, some influencer account pinned it to their highlights:

【#She Says It's Not Harassment Between Girls#】

【#Pink Underwear Girl's Classroom Meltdown#】

I became a campus "celebrity." The video got remixed with weird sound effects and filters, turned into memes.

The comments were all:

【If you dress like a slut, who's to blame?】

【She just wants attention. Probably stripped on purpose】

【Disgusting. Stop playing victim】

I messaged the account privately asking them to delete the video. They replied with two words:

"LMAO."

I went to find a professor. She first said:

"Are you sure she did it 'on purpose'? Aren't you being a bit too sensitive?"

Just as I was about to argue, she frowned at me:

"The way you dressed for class today... wasn't really appropriate."

"Those comments you clapped back at on social media—I suggest you delete them."

"Now that you've made this such a big deal, it's not good for you either."

My nose stung as I held back tears. I asked:

"What about the video? Shouldn't she delete it?"

She thought for a moment:

"I'll talk to her, but don't get worked up. She's also a girl—she probably didn't mean any harm."

This is how it started in my previous life.

Everyone kept telling me: "Don't be so sensitive" "She just doesn't know boundaries" "You're both girls."

But she never pulled Lisa's clothes. Never pulled Rachel's either.

She only pulled mine.

Because I was quiet, easy to bully, got good grades, never argued, never fought back.

The easiest target.

But this time, I won't stay silent.

I opened my phone and saved that video, then exported screenshots of the chat logs.

I was slowly realizing: She wasn't clueless about boundaries.

She was testing mine.

Today was the first test.

Next time, she'd smile as she destroyed me.
