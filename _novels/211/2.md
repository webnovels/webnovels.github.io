"Honey, what are you doing in gynecology?" I cleared my throat, brushing it off: "Just picking up a check-up report." "What about you two?" My gaze fell on Fiona's slightly swollen belly, waiting for their explanation with interest.

"Fiona's boyfriend is on a business trip and asked me to accompany her for a check-up." Nolan answered first, while Fiona gave him a resentful look. I didn't expose them, just responded indifferently.

Suddenly, a pregnant woman started screaming, charging through the crowd like a madwoman. "Compensate me! This unscrupulous hospital owes me my child!" "It's a disturbance, clear the crowd!" a man shouted. But the hospital was crowded, and she was strong. We couldn't dodge in time.

As she was about to knock me and Fiona over, Nolan clung tightly to Fiona, shielding her in his embrace. I was too weak, and her impact threw me hard onto the ground. "It hurts..." I clutched my stomach, pain surging from my abdomen, and bright red blood flowed down my legs.

The surrounding people gasped: "Someone's bleeding! Get a doctor!" Nolan let go of Fiona and rushed over. Seeing my blood, a panic flashed in his eyes: "Honey, does it hurt? I'll take you to the emergency room now."

I was in too much pain to speak, reaching out to him, hoping he'd carry me. "Oh my God, Fiona, it hurts so much, honey, where are you?" Hearing Fiona's cries, his attention immediately shifted to her. Without explaining her calling him "honey," he instinctively let go of my hand and ran to her.

Fiona had scraped her hand on a nearby stone, a small wound bleeding slightly. "It hurts, I'm dying, Nolan, I'm so scared." She whimpered in his arms, her pitiful demeanor making him feel distressed, gently patting her back to comfort her. "Don't worry, I'm here. I'll take you to the emergency room now."

He gritted his teeth, picked her up, and headed straight for the emergency room. Only then did he remember I was still sitting there, looking guilty as he said, "Fiona is pampered, a small scratch makes her cry all day. Being a pregnant woman, she's more urgent. I'll take care of her first."

"The emergency room is just a few steps away. Walk slowly yourself, hold on." "After I take her to the maternity ward, I'll come back to the emergency room for you."
She lay on Nolan, softly sobbing. Seeing her like this tugged at his heart, and he gently patted her back to comfort her.  
"Don't worry, I'm here. I'll take you to the emergency room right away."  
He steeled himself, lifted her in his arms, and hurried to the emergency room.  
As he was leaving, he remembered I was still sitting there and looked at me with guilt. "Fiona is coddled. Even a small scratch makes her cry all day. Plus, she's pregnant, so it's more urgent. I'll take care of her first."  
"The emergency room is just a few steps away. You can walk slowly and hang in there."  
"I'll come back to the emergency room to find you after I take her to the maternity ward."  
I closed my eyes tightly in pain, unable to move my legs. My lower abdomen felt unbearably heavy. Luckily, the incident happened at the hospital entrance, and two medical staff carried a stretcher to take me into the emergency room immediately.  
Because I had just undergone surgery and then fell, the doctor suggested I stay in the hospital for two days to recuperate.  
As the nurse transferred me to the ward, I overheard nurses discussing in the hallway.  
"That pregnant woman earlier just had a small scratch, and her husband ran into the emergency room carrying her, shouting and begging the doctor like a scene from a drama!"  
"This is love, you know. A good man like that is hard to find."  
I smiled, feeling incredibly ironic.  
A man who ignores his seriously injured wife and kneels to the doctor for a mistress with a scratch is indeed hard to find.  
Nolan and Fiona disgust me more every day.  
I have never felt so desperate to leave.
