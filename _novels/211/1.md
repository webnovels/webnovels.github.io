Nolan returned home to retrieve his phone, telling me the project required an all-nighter to revise the plan and advising me to sleep without waiting for him. I pretended not to notice the red mark on his neck, casually nodded, and returned to editing the screenplay soon to be filmed.

He leaned over for a quick glance and clicked his tongue, full of disdain. "You've been out of the movie industry for so long, looking at these scripts is just pretending to love them."

Without a word, I rolled my eyes. Since becoming a housewife, Nolan's appreciation for my artistic pursuits turned into sarcasm.

Seeing my displeasure, he softened his tone. "It's my fault for not spending enough time with you, leaving you bored to dig through these old things." He suddenly draped his arm over my shoulder, his hand reaching for my blouse buttons. "Adeline, let's have a baby. Having a child with you would be better than doing nothing all day."

He leaned against me, his breath heavy. I smelled Fiona's perfume on him, the incense too strong, making me nauseous. I didn't want any physical contact with him. He just got out of her bed and now wants intimacy with me. Doesn't he find it disgusting?

I excused myself to the bathroom, pushing his hand away and locking the door behind me. Waves of disgust surged within me. I used to desperately want children, clinging to him every night for one. He said he didn't like kids and refused.

The child in my womb now was conceived after I lied about taking birth control. I planned to reveal it after three months, betting he'd soften and keep the baby. But when I went for a solo check-up, I saw him accompanying Fiona for hers. She was three weeks ahead of me in pregnancy.

Seeing how carefully he protected Fiona, I realized he didn't dislike kids, just the ones I bore. My heart turned cold at that moment, and I immediately changed my registration to schedule an abortion.

Now Nolan wants to have a baby with me only because he feels guilty for betraying me, thinking a child could compensate. I wonder if Nolan will be crushed when he finds out I'd rather abort than bear his child.

When I emerged from the bathroom, he'd already taken a call and left quickly. I enjoyed the peace, closed the door, and had a good night's sleep.

The next day, I reported to the hospital early. As the cold anesthetic entered my body, I couldn't help but shed tears. I'm sorry, baby, I once longed for you, but now I have to let you go. But I know you'd support my decision.

The procedure was done quickly. When I opened my eyes again, the nurse informed me I could go home. "Ma'am, are you alone? Do you need to call your husband to pick you up?" I shook my head, leaning against the wall as I slowly left.

I could still faintly hear the nurses chatting behind me. "So pitiful, her man didn't show up at all." "Hopelessly lovesick, even the hospital can't cure that." I laughed at myself. They were right; I loved Nolan so much it clouded my judgment. Now, this is the price I pay.

At the hospital entrance, I bumped into a couple. As I struggled to stand, the three of us locked eyes. Across from me, Nolan was holding Fiona, looking at me in panic.
