As the second blow was about to land, someone suddenly burst in. He stopped the bodyguard. "Young Master Jackson, Miss Avery isn't someone you can touch now." "Stop and apologize to Miss Avery. It might make your life easier later." Phoebe looked uneasy at the sight of the bodyguard, but she said nothing.

Jackson, however, stared at the intruder for a long time before speaking, "I see you're familiar. You're my brother's bodyguard."

With that, Jackson suddenly grabbed the stick from the bodyguard and smashed it over his head. "How dare you meddle with my affairs." Blood gushed from the bodyguard's head as he collapsed on the ground.

Watching the bodyguard who had been my only hope now lying there, possibly dead, plunged me into despair. "Jackson, please, I'm sorry. Spare the child in my belly."

I was desperate, crying as I spoke. Jackson glanced at the smartphone, then at me, and instructed the bodyguard to release me from the bed. "Now kneel in front of me and tell me what you did wrong."

"If the live stream audience forgives you, then I will too." Clutching my aching belly, I painfully crawled to Jackson and knelt before him. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have betrayed you or gotten pregnant. I'm at fault." "But the child is innocent. Please, spare him."

Jackson looked at my pitiful state and said nothing. Instead, he connected with a netizen's microphone. A furious voice came from the other end of the smartphone. "You deserve to be punished. Show no mercy."

"Are you kneeling here to confess your mistakes?"

"If the viewers in the live streaming room forgive you, then so will I."

Clutching my agonizing stomach, I painfully crawled to Jackson's feet and knelt.

"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have been unfaithful, and I shouldn't have gotten pregnant. I've made terrible mistakes."

"But the child is innocent. Please, I'm begging you, spare him."

Jackson surveyed my disheveled state in silence. Instead, he randomly connected a viewer's mic.

An outraged voice burst through the smartphone.

"You deserve to be punished, you wretched woman. Someone should teach you a lesson."

Phoebe approached Jackson and spoke with deliberate calm,

"Jackson, see, your sister-in-law is still unwilling to give up the child and won't disclose the father's identity."

"It seems she hasn't truly realized her mistakes."

Their conversation made my face go pale. But for the sake of my child, I had to fight.

I endured the pain and abruptly stood up, racing toward the exit.

If I could just make it out of the hospital and call for help, the child might still have a chance.

Just as I was about to escape through the hospital doors, Jackson grabbed my hair from behind.

He yanked me back with such force, I felt my scalp tearing apart.

"You're still thinking of running away, are you?"

"Without a lesson, you won't learn."

He handed me over to the bodyguards, who restrained me on the operating room bed.

"Doctor, perform the procedure and remove the child."

The medical team prepared to administer an anesthetic, but Jackson stopped them.

"She's disgraced herself, and the child is illegitimate. No need for anesthetic."

Under the harsh lights of the operating room, I whispered weakly,

"Jackson, you'll regret this."

I'm sorry, but it looks like the text you're asking to translate is missing. Could you please provide the specific Chinese text that needs translation?

Jackson listened indifferently and remarked,
