Before Grandma Nora could finish, Phoebe interrupted, "Jackson, Grandma doesn't look well. Is Avery not taking good care of her?"

"Or is Grandma being threatened by Avery?"

Hearing this, I found it laughable, "Jackson, you were raised by Grandma, and you disappeared for five years." "You know better than anyone why Grandma's not well."

Phoebe smirked and approached me, "You intruded on the relationship between Jackson and me.

Don't you know why Jackson left?" As she spoke, Phoebe pushed me hard. My belly hit a hospital bed in the corridor, and sharp pain shot through me.

A warm sensation flowed down my thigh. Grandma Nora looked on in panic, "Doctor, come quickly. Avery's child can't be harmed." The doctor and nurses were about to check when Jackson shouted, "No one is allowed to check.

Today, I'm making sure she doesn't keep the child." At the director's signal, the doctor and nurses didn't dare move. Phoebe mocked, "Sister-in-law, carrying someone else's child, betraying Jackson."

"How do you have the nerve to seek help from the family hospital's doctors?" Grandma Nora anxiously searched her bag for her smartphone to call for help.

Jackson ordered the bodyguard to take Grandma's phone away. "Grandma, what kind of manipulation did Avery use on you?"

"You're still trying to help her." "Grandma, I'm telling you, this child must not remain." Grandma Nora was shocked, "Jackson, I'm your grandmother. Won't you even listen to me?" Saying this, Grandma Nora supported me to leave and find another hospital.

But the bodyguard restrained her. "Jackson, stop this madness." I struggled to stand, clutching my belly, breaking out in cold sweat, "The child in my belly isn't yours to touch. Let me go now, or you can't handle the consequences." Jackson stared at me, silent for a moment. Then Phoebe started live streaming with her smartphone. She whispered something in Jackson's ear. Jackson took the smartphone from Phoebe and aimed it at me, "Avery, if you don't want a dignified procedure in the hospital, I'll do it another way."

"Remember the consequences of betraying me." Jackson ordered the bodyguard to tie me to the hospital bed. I stared in horror at the bodyguard holding a stick.

I struggled desperately, trying to break free. I was ready to reveal the true identity of the child's father. "Jackson, you're insane. The child I'm carrying is..."

Before I could finish, the bodyguard, at Jackson's signal, struck my belly with a stick. The intense pain turned my words into cries of agony.

Blood seeped from the places my wrists and ankles were bound due to my struggles. "This is the price for betraying me and getting pregnant with someone else's child."

The live stream audience, after hearing the story, joined in. "This woman is obviously trouble." "Cheaters deserve to die. Don't let her off easily."

"Teach her a lesson. Let all women see the consequences of infidelity." Jackson showed me the live stream comments. "Avery, you not only betrayed me, but you also manipulated Grandma into deceiving me."

"Today, I'm going to make sure the child in your belly is dealt with." Grandma Nora, who was locked in an office when the bodyguard tied me up, was now trying to intervene.
