Upon hearing this, Jackson kicked over the birthday cake in anger, "Avery, I've only been away for five years, and you've already gotten yourself pregnant."

"Who does the child belong to?"

"I'm going to make sure he can't survive in New York City." Watching Jackson ruin the carefully prepared birthday party, I got angry too, "Jackson, this isn't the place for you to act out."

"If you're not well, go to the hospital." The mention of "hospital" made Jackson's emotions flare up. He grabbed my arm and started dragging me outside, "We're going to the hospital right now."

Jackson was so strong, I couldn't even struggle. At that moment, Grandma Nora heard the commotion and hurried over with her cane. Seeing Jackson's rough actions, she was instantly alarmed. "Jackson, let go of Avery!"

"Avery is pregnant with..." Jackson's mood softened a bit when he saw Grandma, but his anger surged again at her words. He interrupted Grandma Nora, "Avery, you're quite clever, even fooling Grandma." Then he raised his hand and slapped me hard.

Blood trickled from my mouth as my cheek swelled. Grandma Nora was shocked by the scene.

She tried to rescue me from Jackson's grip. But the bodyguard by Jackson's side kept her away. Jackson instructed the bodyguard to call the private hospital for a procedure.

As he arranged things, he dragged me into the car. Grandma Nora reluctantly got into another car with the bodyguard. None of the surrounding friends offered help. Instead, they watched the scene unfold. Jackson's family was wealthy and influential.

They didn't want to offend him and were happy to give him respect. The car quickly reached the private hospital.

The director personally came out to greet Jackson. Ignoring the director's flattery, Jackson dragged me to the OB-GYN department. "Jackson, let go of me.

The child in my belly is..." Before I could finish, we ran into Phoebe, who had just come out of the doctor's office.

She was Jackson's former sister-in-law and his long-cherished first love. Seeing Jackson, she happily ran over and hugged him. "Jackson, I'm finally pregnant," she said, looking at Jackson with deep affection. Jackson let go of my hand and carefully hugged Phoebe.

"Phoebe, you're pregnant now. Be careful." Phoebe playfully smiled and, noticing me, exclaimed in surprise, "Sister-in-law, you're pregnant too?" Seeing their intimate actions, I instantly understood.

Why Jackson left for five years and why Phoebe disappeared too. They had been together all along. Ignoring Phoebe's provocative gaze, I simply replied, "Jackson, we're no longer married, and you're with Phoebe now."

"Let me go immediately, or you won't be able to handle the consequences." Grandma Nora was shocked to see Jackson and Phoebe together. But it was more important to stop Jackson from doing something rash.

"Jackson, let Avery go home and rest." Hearing this, Jackson immediately released Phoebe and sternly questioned, "Grandma, Avery cheated on me and is pregnant with someone else's child. Do you want me to turn a blind eye?"

Grandma Nora realized Jackson wasn't going to let it go easily. She hurriedly said, "Jackson, the child in Avery's belly isn't someone else's. It's..."
