My husband had a daughter with his first love, Seraphina. I always knew.

I thought if I just stayed by his side.

If I used our daughter to hold him, he would eventually come back to me.

That we could build a happy family.

To get his attention, I pushed our daughter, Aria, to study hard, controlling her every move, molding her into a proper, elegant lady.

I never imagined Aria couldn't take the pressure and took her own life.

My husband then sent me to a mental hospital.

With me out of the way, he successfully brought Seraphina into our lives.

But I woke up, filled with burning hatred. I was reborn.

Aria jumped from a high-rise building, and I couldn't bear the shock. I passed out.

When I woke up, I was told my husband had already taken her body for cremation.

I hadn't even gotten to say goodbye to my own daughter.

I found my husband, demanding to know why he wouldn't let me see her one last time.

But he was embracing Seraphina, surrounded by a group of people.

He told them to take me to a mental hospital.

It hit me then, a sickening clarity. He was an absolute scumbag. Aria's body wasn't even cold, and he was already planning to send me away, seize my family's assets, and install Seraphina as his wife.

I wouldn't accept it. I truly wouldn't.

I lunged forward, confronting him, demanding to know why he was doing this to me.

He slapped me, hard.

"You killed Aria. If you hadn't pushed her so hard, controlled her every move, why else would she have taken her own life?"

My husband also claimed he only married me because of my father.

He only married me because I had a powerful dad.

How pathetic and laughable I was. I’d always known his intentions were impure.

But I believed my true heart could win his.

I knew he couldn't forget Seraphina, that he even had a daughter with her.

I once thought that if I stayed by his side, if I raised Aria into a perfect lady.

He would finally look at me. It turns out, I was just deluding myself.

My husband was discussing with the medical staff how to deal with me, when Seraphina suddenly walked over, crouching down to whisper in my ear.

At that moment, she wasn't gentle or frail at all. All that remained was pure malice.

She hissed, "You look pathetic. What good did getting his body do? You'll never have his heart. And now, even his body belongs to me too."

Aria's death had already shattered me, and I couldn't control my emotions any longer.

I yanked her hair, forcing her forehead to the ground, making her grovel as if begging for my daughter's forgiveness.

Seraphina shrieked in terror, drawing Damian's attention.

He rushed toward us, and I felt a sedative injected into my neck by the medical staff.

The last thing I saw was my husband gently comforting Seraphina, then casting a look of utter disgust my way.

Hatred coiled around my heart, a venomous snake. If I got another chance, I would never let that cheating couple get away with it.
