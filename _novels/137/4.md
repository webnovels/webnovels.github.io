Suddenly, I became the laughingstock of the party.

I took advantage of the distraction to hide in the tree outside the mansion.

As a child, to avoid being beaten, I would climb the tree, ignoring Mrs. Williams' shouts from below.

"You brat! Get down here and take your beating!"

I also met Asher from next door while in that tree.

He told me to jump into his yard, promising to catch me so I wouldn't get hurt.

But now I heard a familiar voice.

It was Adeline and a waiter from the party.

The waiter scratched his head. "Miss Williams, you agreed to Mr. Gideon's proposal today. Should we still use Uncle Gideon's drug?"

Adeline replied smugly, "Of course. Gideon's overseas business is much more lucrative than the Johnson Corp's. Who wouldn't want to marry someone wealthier?"

Hearing this, an idea suddenly struck me.

If I went with Gideon, I wouldn't have to be with that white-bearded old man, right?

Recalling Gideon's face, his sharp eyebrows, bright eyes, high nose bridge, and defined jawline, perhaps the alcohol was taking effect, and I felt my cheeks warm.

I had to admit, the Johnson family produces handsome men. Gideon seemed even more attractive than Asher.

I heard Gideon was involved in the gray market business overseas, so he might have influence domestically too.

Surely he could protect me.

I didn't want to become the plaything of that old man.

Without delay, I changed into a waiter's outfit and slipped back into the party.

I saw Gideon swaying slightly, with Adeline quietly trailing behind.

Asher suddenly blocked Adeline. "Adeline, you accepted my proposal today. Isn't it time for us to share a dance?"

Adeline glanced in Gideon's direction but still agreed to dance with Asher.

Asher held Adeline's waist, and they started dancing to the song I used to dance with him most often.

No one looked my way, so I followed Gideon into a room.

As the door clicked shut, Gideon seemed to regain some clarity.

The room was dark. He stared at me. "Who are you? Dare to follow me? Do you have a death wish?"

Standing by the door, my palms were sweaty.

When I didn’t respond, he abruptly turned on a lamp.

Seeing my face, he smiled slightly. "It's you."

He smirked, mockery in his eyes. "So eager to get into my bed?"

I bit my lower lip, forcing myself to stay calm. "Gideon, I need your help."

His fingers slowly traced my collarbone, his voice low and tempting. "Tell me, why should I help you?"

I lowered my gaze, struggling to suppress my humiliation, clenching my fists tightly. "If you agree to help me, I'm willing to be your woman."

Gideon leaned closer to my ear. "I've been waiting for you, but there's no need to rush."

Perhaps it was the effect of the drug; he kissed me passionately.

Suddenly, there was the sound of a door opening. He looked towards the entrance, raising his gaze. "Get out!"

My back was to the door, but I guessed it was Adeline.

After a moment of intimacy, Gideon held me in his arms. "So, tell me, how do I compare to Asher?"

My face flushed red. "Uncle, you're still as strong as ever."

Gideon chuckled softly at this. "Uncle? Do you think I'm old?"

I closed my eyes, unable to meet his gaze. "Then what should I call you?"

"Call me Gideon."

I took a deep breath and met his gaze. "Gideon."

Gideon traced my earlobe with his thumb, whispering, "You're finally mine. I've waited so long for this day."

I was stunned. What did he mean by that?
