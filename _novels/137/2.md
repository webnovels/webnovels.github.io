"Tonight, the usual place."

Asher wanted me to go to him again tonight.

He just said he'd propose to my sister, yet wanted to sneak around with me.

Fine, it's time to end this.

As soon as I entered, I saw Asher's robe half-open, approaching me.

"Cora, you're back."

I stepped back, looking up coldly at him.

Asher still pinned me against the wall, nails teasing my chin, "Angry?"

I turned away, "Don't touch me."

"Tomorrow's gala is important. Cora, your status isn't suitable to attend. What's wrong with inviting your sister as my dance partner?"

"Besides being a dance partner, what about the proposal? Did you think I didn't hear? Asher, what do you think of me?"

I pushed Asher with all my might, causing him to stagger.

Seeing my resistance only excited him more. He lifted my hands, pinning them to the wall.

"Cora, after all these years, you really don't know what you mean to me?"

His other hand roamed my body.

I frowned, tears falling from my eyes.

For five years, I was just Asher's tool to satisfy his desires.

Seeing me cry, Asher didn't force me further.

He released my hands, speaking gently to console me.

"Cora, I'm now the heir. Marrying your sister is more appropriate. You can still stay here; Adeline won't trouble you."

"If you find it lonely, I can give you a child."

I laughed.

He knew I was illegitimate, yet he wanted my child to be his too.

I looked at Asher with disappointment, "All these years, was it all for nothing? Have you ever loved me?"

Asher wiped my tears with his hand but said nothing.

He didn't give me an answer.

Feeling deflated, I said, "Let me go."

Asher blocked the door with his body, "Cora, recognize your status. You know how I've treated you. This is the best solution I can think of."

I pushed him away, "Recognize my status? Don't forget, you came to me first. You said you'd protect me, take care of me. Why didn't you tell me to recognize my status then?"

My words angered Asher. Usually, I would appease him, but today, he was already being patient with me.

His eyes turned cold, "Cora, I advise you to stay by my side."

But I opened the door, "Asher, let's end this."

Asher sneered, "Cora, who else would want you after I've worn you out?"

"You're just a nanny's child, daring to think you can be my wife? You're not even comparable to Adeline!"

I didn't reply, just walked out and slammed the door behind me.

Asher was furious, he opened the door and shouted, "Cora, if you have guts, don't come back!"

I returned to the home that didn't welcome me, heartbroken.

I locked myself in my room, crying softly through the night.

The next morning, there was a light knock at the door.
