"Miss Cora, Mr. Williams said you should attend tonight's gala too." It was Nanny Taylor.

I didn't need to think to know it was Adeline's idea to embarrass me.

I found a dress in the closet, a gift from grandmother before she passed.

She said she wouldn't see me grow up, so this dress would witness it for her.

Now, I finally had the chance to wear it, to witness my former love's proposal.

The dress was a gentle green, making me appear more refined.

The hall was brightly lit, filled with guests.

Asher and Adeline stood in the center, a perfect couple.

Suddenly, Asher took out the engagement ring, kneeling on one knee.

"Adeline, will you marry me?"

Adeline covered her mouth, tears of joy streaming down, "Asher, I will!"

Guests applauded, congratulating them, while I stood in the shadows, expressionless.

They laughed brightly, as if I never existed.

But some busybody noticed me.

"Tsk, isn't that the second Miss Williams? I heard Mr. Williams doesn't like her. After all, she's just an illegitimate child."

"Exactly, it's Miss Williams' day. Why is she here?"

Just then, a gentle voice came.

"Come, have a drink with me."

I looked up to see Gideon, the gentle uncle Adeline mentioned, standing not far away.

He wore a well-tailored gray suit, holding a glass of red wine, looking at me with dark eyes.

Gideon smiled slightly, taking a few steps closer, "What, don't even have the courage for a drink?"

I took the champagne he offered, lightly clinking glasses.

I tilted my head back, downing the drink, feeling the burn in my throat.

Gideon's eyes flashed with admiration, "Interesting."

Adeline noticed the commotion, taking Asher's arm and walking over.

She wore a shy yet proud smile, but her eyes were full of deliberate disdain.

She looked me over, smirking, "Sister, your dress is unique. But isn't that the old dress grandmother left you? How pitiful, not even having a proper gown."

Asher stood by her side, expression cold.

Adeline clung to his arm, playfully shaking it, "Asher, don't you think so?"

Asher's eyes darkened, gently holding Adeline's hand, looking at her with warmth and affection, "Yes, Adeline is right. She doesn't belong here."

She wore a shy yet self-satisfied smile, but her eyes betrayed an unmistakable disdain.

She looked me up and down with a smirk, "Sister, your dress is quite unique. But isn't it the old dress grandmother left you before she passed away? How unfortunate that you can't even afford a proper gown."

Asher stood beside her, his expression indifferent.

Adeline clung to his arm and shook it affectionately, "Asher, don't you think so?"

Asher's eyes darkened a little as he gently took Adeline's hand, his gaze tender and deep. "Yes, Adeline is right. She doesn't belong here."

I gripped my champagne glass tightly, my fingers trembling slightly.

Adeline continued, "Today is a wonderful day. It's dull to be alone. Why not have Asher find someone to keep you company?"

As soon as she finished speaking, someone nearby chimed in, "I'll pay a hundred thousand for a night with Miss Cora!"

Adeline pretended to restrain them, "What are you doing? She's my sister!"

"I'll pay two hundred thousand!"

"Three hundred thousand!"

The bids grew louder, yet there wasn't a flicker of emotion in Asher's eyes.

Gideon stood at a distance, holding a champagne glass, watching the spectacle.

It wasn't until an elderly man with a white beard shouted a million that my father stepped in to stop the charade.

"If you're interested in my daughter, why don't we arrange an engagement between our families?"

My eyes filled with tears as I glanced at Asher.

He still stood by Adeline, gently arranging her hair, as if none of this concerned him.

"Dad!" I stepped forward, my voice so hoarse it was barely audible. "I'm not an object to be auctioned off!"

My father snorted coldly, his eyes filled with disdain. "You still have the nerve to speak? Your mother climbed into bed for money! Now you're just a cheap thing. If someone bids, shouldn't you hurry over to serve them?"

The hall erupted in laughter, and my face turned pale, almost unable to stand.

My father set my wedding date for three days later.
