My mind went blank, yet I kept recalling the times with Asher.

Because he liked excitement, I had to be with him in the park, in the car, even in the cinema.

Initially, I refused, but Asher always said that after this, he'd come to my house to propose.

Until tonight, when I was drugged and accidentally discovered his true intentions.

He did plan to propose, just not to me.

I held my breath and continued eavesdropping on the call, though it was unclear.

All I heard was Asher's mocking voice, "A nanny's child can only ever serve. If Adeline wants, let her take care of us. It's not a bad deal."

I couldn't help but laugh at myself. Five years, and in the end, I'm only fit to be Asher's caregiver.

My mother was originally a nanny for the Williams Family. My father mistook her for someone else when he was drunk, and that's how I came to be.

My mother left in a hurry, but when she discovered she was pregnant, she couldn't bring herself to abort me.

After giving birth, she sent me back to the Williams Family. If my grandmother hadn't taken me in, I might have died with my mother.

Later, when my grandmother passed away, the lady of the house always gave me a hard time.

That's when Asher appeared; he'd sneak food from home for me, "Cora, eat slowly, no one's going to take it from you."

He'd also promise firmly, "I'll protect you in the future."

The call ended, and I pretended to sleep while Asher tucked me in.

I started to wonder, did he ever have any real feelings for me?

The next morning, I returned home.

That afternoon, I saw Asher dressed formally at the Williams Family's place.

He rarely dressed so formally; the suit made him look even more handsome.

Asher took out the gemstone necklace I had always wanted. Sunlight made it sparkle.

I had begged him for a long time, but he never bought it for me.

I hid behind the wall, like a mouse afraid of the light.

Asher performed a courteous bow, "Miss Williams, would you honor me as my dance partner at tomorrow night's gala?"

Adeline gave a shy smile and accepted the necklace, "Mr. Johnson, you must know, I never partner with anyone unless he's my future husband."

Nanny Taylor chimed in, "Yes, our Miss Williams is very self-respecting, unlike the second Miss who is out carousing every day."

With that, Nanny Taylor's eyes locked on me, watching from afar.

But Asher didn't spare me a glance. His voice trembled, "Adeline, if you're willing, I'll propose to you at the gala tomorrow."

I had never seen Asher this nervous.

Adeline, face full of shyness, said, "Mr. Johnson is now the heir of Johnson Corp. How could I refuse? But this isn't my decision alone. If Mr. Johnson is sincere, he should ask my father first."

I didn't understand. Before, when Adeline talked about Asher, she said, "That Asher, though young, has a stubborn streak. I prefer his uncle, who's only a few years older, with a magnetic voice and gentle nature."

But now that Asher is the heir, she's changed her tune.

Adeline looked back at me, eyes full of arrogance and pride.

I could only stand there, letting my nails dig into my palms.

When Asher left, my phone vibrated slightly. It was a message from him.
