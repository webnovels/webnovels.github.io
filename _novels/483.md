Just because Chloe wanted to know whether a Tibetan Mastiff or a wolf was stronger, my boyfriend Liam locked me, a wolf-born, in a cage with a giant Tibetan Mastiff.

I dragged my body, still weak from the recent abortion I had for him, and fought the Mastiff to the death.

As I was being bitten to a bloody pulp, Liam was up in the stands covering the eyes of his frightened sweetheart Chloe.

Seeing this, Liam's buddies immediately started teasing:

"Bro, this Aria really can transform into a wolf for you, fighting a 400-pound Mastiff for so long!"

"But after you treat her like this for Chloe's sake, she's probably going to give up on you completely and stop chasing after you."

As soon as they finished speaking, someone retorted: "Our bro Liam is Aria's imprinted lover. Once a wolf imprints, that bond never disappears!"

"Even if Liam wanted to skin her alive to make a fur coat for Chloe, she would hand over her pelt without complaint!"

Hearing this, Chloe looked at Liam with confused eyes and asked, "Liam, can she really go that far for you?"

Liam's lips curled into a smug smile. "Wolf-people must unconditionally obey and protect their imprinted lover."

"So even if I told her to die, she would still love me to the bone and obey without question."

He said it so casually, but it felt like my blood was flowing backwards through my veins.

But Liam, you're wrong. A wolf's imprint is not impossible to break, and I'm not destined to only love you...
