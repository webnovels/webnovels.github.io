Sixteen years passed in the blink of an eye.

Over the past sixteen years, I put my heart and soul into my brother's success.

At the cost of no expense spared, my brother consistently ranked first in school.

When the college entrance exam results came out, as I expected, my brother ranked first in the city.

As soon as the results were out, reporters camped outside my door.

Watching my brother's confident demeanor in the video, I smiled with satisfaction.

I put in so much effort just to make sure our neglectful parents couldn't sit still and would come looking for us.

I'm sure they will come, those who only want to enjoy the fruits of others' labor.

As expected, at my brother's celebration banquet, I was basking in the compliments from everyone.

The hotel door was suddenly pushed open from outside.

I stood up at the sound and saw my supposedly paralyzed parents walk in.

"How could we, your parents, not come on such an important day for our Chloe?"

The results just came out, and journalists crowded at my doorstep.

Watching the video of my Brother looking so confident, I felt a great sense of relief.

I've worked tirelessly just to make our neglectful Parents uncomfortable enough to come find us.

I'm sure they will come. They've always wanted to just sit back and enjoy the benefits.

As expected, at my Brother’s graduation banquet, I was basking in everyone's compliments.

Suddenly, the hotel door swung open from the outside.

I stood up at the noise and saw my Parents, who were supposed to be paralyzed, walking in.

"How could we not be here for such an important day for Chloe?"

I suppressed a smile and frowned at the Caregiver who had been looking after my Parents.

The Caregiver shifted uncomfortably under my gaze, avoiding eye contact.

Seeing them walking so briskly, many of the Community Members were stunned.

After all, they had been in wheelchairs for the past sixteen years.

Ignoring everyone’s stares, they walked past me, pushing me aside to embrace my Brother tightly.

My Dad lovingly patted my Brother’s head, tears streaming down his face.

"Chloe, it's Dad."

My Brother pulled away, grabbing my arm with a look of disdain.

"Sister, who is this crazy person? Why are they claiming to be my dad? I don’t have a dad like that!"

Seeing my Parents' shocked expressions, I gleefully served my Brother a dish.

My Dad, seeing his son’s disdainful look, was visibly embarrassed.

"Logan! Did you teach him this? You taught Chloe not to recognize us!"

"Otherwise, Chloe was so well-behaved as a kid. How did he end up like this?"

My Mom began to beat her chest and stomp her feet.

"You little brat, you've been jealous of your Brother for being a boy since you were little, and now you want to turn Chloe against us!"

I was speechless at their shamelessness. They hadn’t raised us for a single day, so how could we acknowledge them!

Seeing I didn't respond, my Dad, feeling provoked, moved forward to kick me.

Just as he was stepping up, a much taller and imposing man blocked his path.

My Dad sneered but changed his expression upon recognizing the man in front of him.

"Mr. Anderson, you're here too?"

"If I’m not mistaken, I didn’t notify you to come today."

The man's voice was authoritative and commanding.

My Dad’s bravado disappeared.

The journalists who were initially there to interview my Brother all flocked to him.

"Mr. Anderson, you’re number one on the wealth list again this month. Can we get an interview?"

Mr. Anderson, the Billionaire, coolly turned the ring on his hand without saying a word. The crowd gradually fell silent.

When he turned to us, his expression softened.

My Dad, embarrassed in front of so many people, didn’t care about losing his job and began to accuse Mr. Anderson.

"Mr. Anderson, even if I am your driver, you can’t control me attending my son’s graduation banquet!"

My Dad was grinning widely.

"Mr. Anderson, my Chloe is the Valedictorian here!"

Mr. Anderson chuckled at his words.

"Your Chloe?"

Hearing that, I couldn’t help but laugh too.

My Dad was too naive, thinking my Brother beside me was his Chloe.

In my past life, he didn’t care whether I lived or died. How could I continue being his scapegoat?

They still naively thought I would raise him dutifully. It’s laughable! I’ve been planning for sixteen years, waiting for this day!

Seeing my Dad’s smug face, I kindly explained to them.

"Well, actually..."

"He’s not your Chloe; he’s really just my Brother."

Hearing this, my Dad snorted.

"Chloe is our only son. How could that be wrong?"

"But you, you're not even her real Sister."

I'm sorry, it seems there is a placeholder or boundary marker instead of the actual content that needs to be translated:
