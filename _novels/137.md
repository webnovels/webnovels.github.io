I was with Asher for five years, yet I wasn't even officially his girlfriend.

That night, once again, he was with me until I lost consciousness.

Half-awake, I found an engagement ring in the drawer and thought our relationship finally had a future.

I vaguely heard him on the phone with his friend Declan, "How's the proposal setup coming along?" I was thrilled.

But in the next moment, Asher sneered, "Her? She's worn out. If I weren't worried about hurting Adeline on our wedding night, she wouldn't even be in my bed."

That's when I realized I was just a stepping stone for my sister.
