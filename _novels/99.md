I cherished her as my most precious treasure, only to discover she was an imposter.

My real daughter was cruelly abandoned by my husband to live among beggars.

While that little bastard child wore designer clothes dripping in luxury, my true daughter was in rags and starving.

As that imposter went abroad to study, polishing her golden future, my daughter remained illiterate.

Even when my daughter escaped her hellish life and came home seeking her family, my husband viciously drove her away behind my back.

My exhausted daughter stumbled forward in the pouring rain, only to be struck down by a drunk truck driver.

When I learned the truth and tried to seek justice for my daughter, that little bastard pushed me into an icy river. As I was dying, I saw my husband arm-in-arm with his lover, embracing that imposter child.

"Thank you for raising our daughter to be so outstanding," they sneered.

When I opened my eyes again, I had returned to the moment my daughter was born.

This time, I swore to protect my precious baby at all costs!
