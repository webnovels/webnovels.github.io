On my commute, I saw a forum post titled: "Expecting a boy but overwhelmed with work. How can I get colleagues to help?" The OP shared her excitement about carrying the "family heir" but complained of morning sickness and a heavy workload, asking how to make coworkers more considerate.
The comments tore into her entitlement: "Why work if the baby's so precious?" and "Your husband should step up, not your colleagues." Ignoring the backlash, she liked a manipulative suggestion: "Pick a quiet, young colleague to be the godmother—she won't refuse, and you can boss her around." I reported the post.
Then, at work, my desk neighbor happily announced, "I'm pregnant—two months along!"
Felicia's voice was bright and cheerful, pitched just loud enough for the entire open-plan office to hear.
A chorus of congratulations immediately filled the air.
"Wow, Felicia, you're going to be a mom!"
"Congratulations!"
Amid the well-wishes, Felicia grabbed my hand with an almost cloying warmth.
"Chloe, you and I are the closest here. You're so brilliant, I've always thought of you as a little sister."
"So, I wanted to ask if you would be my baby's godmother. Let him soak up some of your good fortune!"
I froze.
The forum post flashed through my mind, specifically the line about "finding a quiet pushover to be the godmother."
It couldn't be... that much of a coincidence, could it?
I gently pulled my hand back, my smile feeling stiff and unnatural.
"Congratulations, Felicia, that's wonderful news. But... isn't it a bit early to be asking me to be a godmother?"
"I only just graduated. I'm practically still a kid myself."
Linda, a veteran colleague nearing retirement, chimed in with a good-natured laugh. "She's right, Felicia. Chloe doesn't even have a boyfriend yet. It wouldn't be proper for her to be a godmother."
I shot her a grateful look. "Exactly! Linda's right. My mom has warned me about that, too."
Felicia's smile faltered for a split second, a flicker of annoyance in her eyes. But she quickly plastered it back on. "Oh, listen to me, getting carried away with excitement. I wasn't thinking."
She said she wasn't thinking, but she didn't move. She clearly wasn't finished.
After a few seconds of silence, Felicia placed a hand on her still-flat stomach, her voice turning soft and frail.
"Being pregnant is such a blessing, but sigh..."
"It’s just this first trimester. The symptoms are hitting me so hard. I'm dizzy, nauseous, and my back aches if I sit for too long."
"And the subway every day... it's so crowded, and I worry about the radiation from the security scanners. I don't know if it's safe for the baby..."
Her tone shifted. "Chloe, don't you drive to work every day?"
"I was wondering... could I possibly get a ride with you?"
A ride?
We live in completely opposite directions. What she wanted wasn't a ride, it was a free chauffeur.
I laughed coldly to myself but put on a troubled, apologetic expression.
"Oh, Felicia, what terrible timing."
"My car broke down last Friday. The mechanic said they have to order a part from out of state, and it'll take at least a month. See? I had to take the subway this morning, too."
I held up my hands in a gesture of helplessness.
I was suddenly incredibly grateful that I'd been too busy to get gas last weekend. This morning, the car wouldn't even start.
Felicia's expression froze, a mixture of disappointment and disbelief. She looked like she wanted to argue but eventually just squeezed out a dry, "Really? What a coincidence."
At lunchtime, I took out my insulated lunch box.
Today's main course was pan-seared salmon. My mom knew it was my favorite and made a point of waking up early every day to pack me a lunch.
The moment I twisted the lid open, a figure appeared at my side.
Felicia stood over my desk and took a long, deep sniff of my food.
"Wow, Chloe, that smells incredible!"
Then, she clutched her chest as if in discomfort. "My morning sickness has been so bad, the smell of everything makes me sick. I can't keep anything down."
"But the second I smelled your lunch... poof! My appetite is back!"
Felicia stroked her abdomen and sighed dramatically. "This isn't me being greedy. It must be my baby craving it!"

I... was speechless.
She looked at me with wide, expectant eyes. "Chloe, could you bring an extra portion for me tomorrow? You're already packing a lunch, so one more serving wouldn't be too much trouble, would it?"
Alarm bells went off in my head.
Packing lunch for a pregnant woman? If anything she ate made her sick, I'd be the one to blame. No thank you.
I forced a smile and quickly deflected. "Felicia, this is just how my mom cooks for me—lots of oil and salt. It might not be suitable for a pregnant woman."
There was no way I was agreeing to this. My mom already worked hard enough making my lunch; why on earth would she cook for Felicia?
Felicia's face fell, her voice instantly turning pitiful.
"But I really can't eat anything else, and the baby needs nutrients..."
"Please, Chloe, just help your big sister out. Help the baby. We can discuss payment."
I remained unmoved, continuing my gentle refusal.
"How about this, Felicia? I can send you the recipes later. They're all simple home-cooked meals, so your family can make them for you. It's always safer to eat food prepared at home."
"Besides, I've heard there are a lot of foods pregnant women should avoid. It's better to have control over what you're eating."
"My husband doesn't know how to cook!" Felicia retorted, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. "He's a man! Why would he go into a kitchen and come out reeking of grease?"
Her logic was so absurd it was almost funny. So, it was beneath her husband to cook, but my mother was expected to?
Before I could say anything else, she reached out, and in a flash, snatched a piece of salmon from my lunch box and popped it into her mouth.
I was completely stunned.
I never imagined she would just grab food from my container. I was too shocked to even react.
She chewed a couple of times, her eyes lighting up.
"Oh, it's fully cooked! This is delicious! My appetite is so off right now, this is exactly the kind of flavorful food I've been wanting."
"Chloe, just bring me a portion tomorrow!" Her tone was no longer a request; it was a demand. A knot of frustration tightened in my chest.
The contents of that forum post echoed in my mind again.
I deliberately furrowed my brow, my expression full of concern. "Felicia, you have to be extra careful when you're pregnant. You can't be casual about your diet!"
"And my mom's cooking... she's not the best. Sometimes things are undercooked, or she adds too much salt. What if you eat it and don't feel well?"
Felicia waved her hand dismissively.
"Then just tell your mom to be more careful. Make sure it's cooked through and not too salty. It's not a big deal."
She paused. "Are you worried I won't pay you?"
"I'll give you five dollars a day for ingredients. That should be plenty, right? Vegetables at the supermarket are only a few cents a pound on sale."
When I didn't respond, she added, "Besides, I'm always looking out for you. Remember that apple I gave you last week?"
I almost laughed out loud.
That apple was from the company's complimentary afternoon snack cart. She had just passed one to me. Now it was some grand gesture of generosity?
And five dollars? That wouldn't even cover a corner of this piece of salmon.
I took a deep breath and put on a righteous, responsible expression.
"Felicia, this isn't about money. The main thing is that my mom's cooking isn't standardized. What if she uses something you can't eat? I can't take that responsibility."
"We both need to be cautious. And didn't you say this morning that your in-laws are placing a lot of importance on this baby?"
With that, I turned to our colleague Brenda, who was eating at the next desk. "Brenda, you've had kids, you have experience. Isn't that right? A pregnant woman's diet needs to be carefully managed, doesn't it?"
Brenda nodded thoughtfully.
"Chloe has a point. Felicia, you can't be too careful with food from outside, especially from someone else's home kitchen. What if you have an allergy or a bad reaction? That would be serious."
Several other mothers in the office chimed in.
"That's right! You care so much about the baby, you can't just eat anything!"
"Chloe's young and can eat whatever, but you're pregnant. Your body is different. You really do need to be particular."
Every word was reasonable, leaving Felicia with no room to argue.
She had spent the whole morning bragging about the "precious heir" in her belly. She couldn't very well turn around and say, "Oh, it's fine, I can eat whatever."
Still, she wouldn't give up. "But just once or twice..."
"Not even once!" I cut her off immediately. "Felicia, you have to be responsible for your baby! Safety first!"
An idea sparked in my mind, and I pulled out my phone.
"Oh, I know! Let me recommend a professional meal delivery service for expectant mothers!"
"I saw an ad for it. Scientifically balanced, nutritious meals... It's a bit pricey, over a hundred dollars per meal, but the baby's health is what's most important, right?"
Over a hundred dollars?
Felicia's lips twitched violently.
With everyone watching, she couldn't deny that her "baby was precious," but she clearly wasn't willing to spend that kind of money.
She stood there, frozen, and forced a dry laugh.
"Well... in that case, never mind. I... I don't think I have much of an appetite anymore."

That night, I collapsed onto my bed, exhausted.
My phone screen lit up. The post I had reported earlier was still active—my report had been rejected. And it had been updated.
I opened it.
【I'm so pissed! I tried the advice from you ladies today, but that little witch wouldn't budge!】
【First, she played dumb to get out of being the godmother. Then at lunch, she deliberately ate amazing food in front of me to taunt me. I asked her nicely to pack an extra meal for me, and she had the nerve to give me attitude in front of everyone and even ganged up on me with the old hags in the office!】
【How can someone be so evil? Is she just jealous that I'm carrying a boy? How can I force her to obey me and show her what happens when you cross me?!】
Reading this, I was now 100% certain who the poster was. Felicia's behavior was beyond shameless.
I snorted with a mix of anger and amusement.
The comments below were still mostly negative, but a new "suggestion" had quickly risen to the top.
【Girl, are you dense? Of course she's going to say no if you ask her in private! You have to master the art of moral blackmail!】
【Find a public setting, in front of all your colleagues, especially your boss, and ask her to be the godmother again... but this time, give her a reason she can't refuse, or would be too embarrassed to refuse!】
【Think about it. With everyone watching, including management, if she dares to say no, what will people think of her?】
【That she's cold-hearted and ungrateful! How could she possibly survive in the company after that?】
Someone else added to the thread.
【Exactly! And once she's the godmother, you'll have plenty of opportunities to make her spend money.】
【Like when you're in your postpartum period. Say you want to go to a nice postpartum recovery center, but you're short on cash? Just ask the godmother to chip in! She agreed in front of everyone, how could she have the nerve to refuse?】
My eyes widened.
So that was her game.
This wasn't about finding a godmother; it was about finding a long-term cash cow and ATM. Did she think I was the baby's father?
As expected, the original poster replied enthusiastically.
【This idea is brilliant! Why didn't I think of that!】
【Perfect timing, too. Our monthly review meeting is in two days. All the staff and managers will be there!】
【Let's see her try to escape this time!】
Staring at her gleeful words on the screen, a chill ran down my spine.
The monthly review meeting was in two days.
I turned off my phone and took a deep breath.
If that's how you want to play it, fine. I'll play along.
Two days later, at the monthly review meeting.
As soon as Ms. Davis, our director, finished her closing remarks and announced the meeting was over, Felicia suddenly stood up.
Under the confused gazes of everyone in the room, she walked to the front.
"If I could have everyone's attention for just one minute, I'd like to take this happy occasion to share some wonderful news!"
All eyes turned to her.
She placed a hand gently on her stomach, her voice turning sentimental and sorrowful, her eyes welling up.
"There's something that's been weighing on my heart for a long time... Ever since I got pregnant, I've been having the same dream."
"In my dream, my unborn baby keeps telling me that he wants a godmother. And he's already chosen the person."
Her gaze swept across the room and landed squarely on me.
"That person is Chloe!"
"We're the best of friends. She's kind, talented, and she's the person I trust most in this world. The dream felt so real, I know it must be fate. It’s a connection my baby chose himself!"
By this point, she seemed overwhelmed with emotion, tears shimmering in her eyes.
Felicia pulled a small red envelope and a tiny pair of baby socks from her pocket and walked towards me.
"Chloe, today, in front of all our managers and colleagues, I solemnly ask you to be my child's godmother. This is a wish from both me and my baby!"
"This envelope and these little socks are a small token from us. Please, you must accept it!"
Before I could refuse, she had already shoved the envelope and socks into my hands.
A look of triumphant surprise bloomed on Felicia's face, but then, I smiled.
I held the red envelope high in the air, my voice ringing out, full of delight.

"This gift from Felicia and the baby is so precious! Since it's bringing so much good luck, I have a suggestion. Why don't we donate this red envelope?"
"We can buy afternoon tea for the entire department! Let's all share in the good fortune!"
"From now on, this baby will be our whole department's treasure. What do you all say? We can all dote on him together!"
My colleagues, unaware of the backstory, thought it was a fun and heartwarming idea and immediately cheered.
"Great idea!"
"That's so generous of you, Chloe!"
"Yes, let's all be godfathers and godmothers!"
Amid the cheers, Felicia's face went rigid and pale.
She wanted to stop me, but with everyone watching, she couldn't find a reason.
Encouraged by the crowd, I opened the envelope right then and there.
Inside was a single, crumpled one-dollar bill.
The buzzing room fell dead silent.
The enthusiastic gazes of a moment ago turned strange, all of them now fixed on Felicia.
The amount in the envelope was just a gesture, of course... but—
One dollar? That was just pathetic.
Felicia's face flushed crimson. She scrambled to explain, her voice strained and awkward.
"The-the money isn't important! It's a tradition where I'm from. The godmother envelope always has one dollar in it, for good luck—it symbolizes wholehearted devotion! It's the sentiment that counts!"
"Chloe, back home, a baby has to have a godmother chosen before they're born to ensure they grow up safe and sound. My dream was a sign. You have to be the one!"
Having found her footing, her voice grew louder, more insistent.
"You wouldn't disrespect a tradition like that, would you? You wouldn't disregard the baby's health and safety?"
"Right, everyone? Traditions and a baby's wish, those are important things!"
As she'd hoped, a few colleagues who were swayed by her words began to murmur in agreement.
"Well, you should respect traditions..."
"Being a godmother is nice. You get a baby without the pain!"
"It's all for the baby's sake, Chloe. You should just say yes."
I listened to the whispers with a silent, scornful laugh.
Outwardly, I put on a look of dawning comprehension mixed with distress.
"Oh, I see! Felicia, what a coincidence. We have a tradition where I'm from, too."
My voice was tinged with a naive confusion.
"They say an unmarried woman can't be a godmother, because it will jinx her own romantic prospects and make it hard for her to find a partner."
I turned to a few of the older women in the room.
"Linda, Sarah, you've heard of that one, right? I think the older generation all says that."
