I woke up one morning and saw numbers hovering above everyone’s heads.

Above my mom, it was 9450.

Above my dad, it was 8639.

The numbers above our housekeeper and butler were far lower than my parents’: in the hundreds, even the tens.

Dazed, I drove out into Crescent Bay to test the theory. Most strangers had single-digit numbers floating above them; seeing anything above 10 was rare.

I drove home with my mind spinning, only to find my parents’ numbers had changed. Both were down by 1 since the morning.

A jolt ran through me.

Could these be the remaining times I would see them?

The thought sent a chill down my spine.

Today, I also saw my sworn enemy, Rhys Montgomery. But the number above his head—

It was only 3.

1

To test my suspicion, I paid an unannounced visit to the Montgomery estate the next morning.

The sight of me, a rare visitor, made Rhys’s parents beam. They warmly ushered me to the sitting room. I stared at the numbers above them, both close to 2000, and grew more confused. I had over two thousand chances to see his parents, but only three left with Rhys himself?

Just then, Rhys sauntered down the main staircase, still tying his bespoke tie. Sure enough, the number above his head had dropped to 2.

My heart skipped a beat. I held the teacup, momentarily speechless.

“Savannah Finch, what brings you here?”

He caught sight of me, a flicker of surprise in his eyes, as he walked over with a smirk that never quite reached his eyes.

I put down the cup, abruptly stood up, and, completely out of character, looped my arm through his.

“Rhys Montgomery, are you planning a long trip or, say, emigrating soon?”

He lowered his lashes, focusing on my hand on his arm, a puzzled look on his face. “Recently? No.”

I blinked, and amidst the knowing glances of the staff around us, I leaned in and whispered a suggestion: “Are you free today? Let me take you for a full medical checkup.”

Rhys was my rival, my tormentor since childhood, but the genuine possibility of him having a sudden, terminal illness sent a wave of panic through me.

His expression shifted slightly, then he laughed dismissively and lightly tapped my nose. “I just had a physical a few weeks ago, perfectly healthy. Want me to forward you the results?”

On the sofa, his parents exchanged a look, as if they wanted to say something but couldn’t. I knew they were wondering why I was acting so intimate with Rhys today, only six months after I flat-out refused the proposed Montgomery-Finch merger/marriage.

I couldn’t explain. I clung to him, my gaze darting up to the stark ‘2’ above his head. If it wasn’t an acute illness, could it be an accident?

“Rhys Montgomery, I’m sticking with you today. Where you go, I go!”

After making that bold declaration, I marched out, clutching his arm tightly, under the amazed eyes of everyone present.

I was inseparable from him all morning. When he led the morning board meeting, I stood outside the clear glass wall of the conference room, my eyes fixed like a laser beam on the number above his head. At one point, his secretary brought me a chair and a coffee, clearly worried I’d tire myself out.

When Rhys stepped out to use the restroom, I followed him down the hall, not letting him out of my sight. He finally looked at me, a helpless expression on his face.

“We’ve reached the door. You can stop now.”

I shamelessly tightened my grip on his suit sleeve, justifying myself. “This is your private washroom. I’ve known you since we were in matching toddler overalls; following you in is hardly out of line.”

He managed a strained smile. “You’re taking a dare this seriously? Who did you lose to, Tatum Bell? Only she could come up with something so vindictive.”

I instantly realized he thought I was just fulfilling a humiliating social debt. But this clinginess couldn’t last forever. If he needed to… do more than wash his hands, was I supposed to stare at him from inside the stall?

...

That image was too much. I’d just let him go and see if the number changed when he came out. I still had one visit to spare, anyway.

In those few seconds, my mind raced. Until I heard Rhys’s resigned voice.

“You want to come in? Fine. Come in. If you’re not embarrassed, why should I be?” He started to pull me inside.

I stopped abruptly, pulled my hand away, and looked away. “On second thought, no.”

Rhys let out a dry, short laugh. “Tapping out already.”

But the moment his back disappeared behind the door, a fresh wave of panic hit. Ignoring everything, I pulled out my phone and dialed a video call.

A few seconds later, the call connected. The screen showed the bathroom ceiling, and I could hear running water.

“Rhys Montgomery, point the camera at your face!”

2

At my non-negotiable command, Rhys turned off the faucet, dried his hands with a tissue, and slowly raised the phone.

“Savannah, my great aunt, you’re only going to torture me for one day, right?”

In the camera, his brows were slightly furrowed, but there wasn't a hint of real annoyance.

When he finally emerged, the number above his head was still 2.

I silently let out a breath of relief.

It seemed the number didn’t decrease simply because we were in separate rooms. It only counted as a new meeting after a certain amount of time apart?

I didn’t dare relax and continued to shadow Rhys, glancing at his head every thirty seconds. By the end of the day, my eyes felt like they were twitching.

At quitting time, Rhys and I walked out of the Montgomery Industries building. A Bentley slid to a stop in front of us, and the window rolled down to reveal Tatum Bell’s grinning face.

“Ha! Busted!”

Today was my weekly gathering with Tatum, but I had bailed on her to keep an eye on Rhys. I couldn't believe she tracked me down here.

Rhys turned his head to me, a hint of dissatisfaction in his tone. “Didn’t you say you were having dinner with me tonight? Why is she here?”

I froze, stunned by the number above Tatum’s head. Tatum was my fiercest friend, my shadow since we were toddlers, so why was her number only 15?!

I immediately yanked open the car door, pulling Rhys in after me.

“I’m in a good mood today. I’m treating you both to a hot spring spa and a huge dinner.”

I sat in the middle of the back seat, flanked by them both, and gave the driver the address of a resort lodge outside the city. The driver, seeing Tatum look confused but not object, drove on.

This was crazy. Even Tatum’s driver had over 500 more visits left with me!

Was this girl hiding something crucial from me?

In the car, Tatum nudged me with her elbow. “Hey, when did your relationship with the Montgomery Devil get so cozy? You used to avoid him like the plague.”

Before I could answer, Rhys chimed in. “Thanks to you, Savannah is now incapable of leaving my side.”

Tatum looked completely bewildered, pointing a finger at her own face. “Me?”

I pulled her hand down and gave her a meaningful look. “Remember? We played Truth or Dare last time, and I lost to you? You dared me to stick to Rhys like glue.”

My trusted accomplice quickly caught on and played along. “Oh, right, right! I totally forgot. My bad, I’ve been so busy lately.”

Hearing that, I narrowed my eyes and pressed her. “Busy with what?”

Tatum sighed, half-pensive, half-dreamy. “Ugh, my dad and my stepmom have decided to send me overseas for grad school. They say my ‘pretty little head’ needs to learn some real knowledge and independence.”

The moment I heard “overseas,” the alarm bells in my head went off.

“Overseas? You’re telling me this now? When are you leaving? Which school? Are you coming back?”

Tatum hadn’t expected my dramatic reaction and stammered her reply.

“I—I only found out recently. My stepmom even contacted the school. I have to leave right after the New Year. But it’s only a one-year Master’s, and the school has a summer break. I’ll definitely be back; I don’t want to live on a revolving door of gray-tasting foreign food forever.”

I quickly did the math. At our current meeting frequency, 15 was about the number of times we’d see each other before she left. From then on, I’d never see Tatum again?

I felt my blood run cold. I was about to say something, but Rhys, who had been resting with his eyes closed, suddenly spoke in a low voice.

“Your stepmother sounds quite eager about this.”

Tatum nodded. “She does, but Dad also said studying abroad is good for me.”

Rhys opened his eyes slightly and smiled, seemingly casually bringing up a topic. “Didn’t your stepmom just have another little boy this year?”

Everyone in our circle knew about the Bell family’s new addition. Tatum’s biological mother died young, and her father married a beautiful second wife who gave birth to a son within a year. This year, their fifth year of marriage, the Bells welcomed a second son, Leo.

The puzzle pieces clicked into a terrifying picture. The Bell family was one of the wealthiest in Crescent Bay. My suspicion was clear. If the stepmother had any ill intentions…

I shivered.

Once we reached the resort, changed into our swimsuits, and were soaking in the hot spring, I spoke to Tatum in a serious tone.

“Tatum, listen to me. Don’t go abroad this time. Find an excuse to refuse. If you want to study overseas, choose the country and school yourself after the New Year. Do not let your stepmother interfere.”

Tatum blinked her wet eyes at me. “Why, Sav?”

Seeing her clueless expression, I decided to go all-in. I told her everything—about seeing numbers above people’s heads and what they meant.

Tatum’s face went white. She lunged forward, clutching me in a hug. “Savannah, promise me you’re not telling me a horror story!”

“Where would I get that kind of imagination?” I patted her back helplessly.

Tatum, ever the dramatic one, immediately grabbed her phone from the edge of the pool. She called her dad, alternating between pleading, feigning illness, and threatening him. Finally, her dad conceded, agreeing to discuss the study abroad plan after the New Year.

The instant Tatum hung up, I clearly saw the number above her head shoot up from 15 to 2000+.

My eyes widened. I stood up in the pool, overjoyed. The number could change! Rhys was saved!

I quickly wrapped myself in a robe and sprinted toward the men’s spa.

Rhys had just finished and was toweling his wet, short hair as he walked. I stopped in front of him, bent over, catching my breath. I was about to look up to check his number, but my gaze somehow lingered on his bare chest for too long.

He finally broke the silence, scoffing. “Running that fast? Did a ghost chase you?”

Normally, I’d have a sharp retort ready. But when I saw the unmoving 2 above his head, I didn't know whether to feel relief or disappointment, and I couldn't speak.

What exactly did I need to do to make the number shoot up?

The thought stopped me cold. Was the idea of seeing Rhys only twice more that upsetting to me? Was I really trying this desperately to change it?

The thought of him facing an accident made my heart sink. I quickly stepped closer to him.

“Rhys Montgomery, we’re sleeping here tonight. Don’t go back. Tomorrow is Saturday; you don’t have to clock in at Montgomery Industries. What do you say?”

Just as I was racking my brain for a way to convince him to share a room, he reached out and touched my head.

“Sure. And not just tomorrow, Savannah. I won’t need to be the CEO of Montgomery Industries anymore.”

I froze, sure I heard him wrong. I looked up and saw Rhys watching me with a complex expression.

He was tall, handsome, with eyes that could charm the devil. He was brilliant and capable. Every time he smiled, I felt like he was a cunning fox about to cause trouble. He was also a master of telling terrifying ghost stories. That’s why, since high school, I’d done my best to avoid him.

Yet, the Finches and the Montgomerys were business partners for decades. Rhys and I were constantly in each other’s orbits.

When he said he was quitting, I instinctively grabbed his wrist, a thread of panic in my voice. “What do you mean? Bored of being CEO? Want to try the common life?”

Rhys looked down, his gaze fixed on my hand gripping his wrist. He didn’t speak for a long moment.

It was then that the 2 above his head suddenly jumped to 10!

I blinked, confirming I hadn’t imagined it. Holding hands made the meeting count go up? What was the logic here?

Instinctively, I reached for his other hand and grasped it tightly.

Rhys’s eyes moved slightly, and the number above him jumped again—to 15.

I threw caution to the wind. I let go and pulled him into a full-body hug. The rhythmic pounding in my chest vibrated against his. I closed my eyes, counted to five, and released him. I looked up.

—30!

Exponential growth!

Before my smile fully formed, and before I could proceed to the next step, Rhys’s fingers gently pinched my chin.

“Savannah Finch.”

His voice held a hint of warning, and his eyes had grown darker. I held my breath, my smile freezing on my lips.

“What exactly is on the top of my head that you keep staring at all day?”
