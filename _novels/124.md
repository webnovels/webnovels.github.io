Aria Collins had a secret that everyone knew - she was in love with her adoptive uncle, Ethan Foster.

At eight years old, when she was nearly strangled to death by bullies at school, it was Ethan who saved her and insisted on severely punishing the wealthy troublemakers.

At twelve, when she got her first period, Ethan mistakenly thought she was sick or injured. He frantically abandoned a multi-million dollar business deal to rush back and take her to the hospital, where they both awkwardly received an impromptu sex ed lesson from the doctor.

At fifteen, Aria ran away from home and accepted a classmate's confession when Ethan didn't make it back in time for her birthday party. Ethan found her at a hotel and flew into a rage, smashing expensive decor in a frenzy.

On her eighteenth birthday, Aria confessed her feelings to Ethan. He responded by darkly remaining silent. The next day, he called a press conference and publicly broadcast a video of her confession on a big screen, condemning her for disregarding moral ethics and family values.

After Aria was viciously attacked on social media for three days straight, Ethan coldly sent her to a behavioral reform school.

After enduring a year of hellish conditions that made her wish she was dead, Aria had barely been released when Ethan demanded she donate a kidney to his fiancée.

The same Aria who had once thrown the entire Foster family into chaos over Ethan's scandalous affairs now quietly nodded in agreement.

She thought to herself, "Now we're even."
