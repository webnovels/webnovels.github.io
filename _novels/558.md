I was added to a weird group chat with the whole class. The group name: **[High-Temperature Apocalypse]**.

Everyone else picked a safe house in the wilderness or a place with abundant water.

I chose a high-rise apartment with no water or electricity.

Chloe, the school's queen bee, mocked me. No one wanted to team up with me, betting I'd die within three days.

When it came to choosing abilities, everyone went for spatial or water-based powers.

I picked reverse photosynthesis, which lets me get energy from air humidity.

The group chat immediately muted me. They didn't want to see my dying pleas for help.

When the system removed the team-up and admin functions, everyone saw the group name reset:

**[Heavy Rain Apocalypse]**.
