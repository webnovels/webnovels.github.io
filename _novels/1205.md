It was the third month I’d been living with Leo when his parents decided to visit.

He brought it up to me, asking if we could tell them that the condo was his.

Considering his pride as a man, I agreed.

That very evening, Leo’s parents moved into the master bedroom, bringing his grandmother and grandfather with them.

Leo promised me that as soon as they left, he would make it up to me in every way.

But I had no idea his parents had no intention of leaving.

Leo showed up to pick me up from work that night—a rarity.

When I got into the car, I was greeted with a latte, a small designer cupcake, and a Swarovski necklace.

Seeing him so ridiculously attentive, I gave him a dry look and asked what he wanted.

Leo stammered out the truth. “My parents are planning to visit for a couple of days, starting tomorrow.”

Leo was from a small town. He’d come to Austin for college and stayed after graduation.

He once told me he was the only person in his whole extended family to graduate from a major university.

He was essentially the family’s hope.

Five years out of school, he’d managed to find a foothold in the city, so it wasn't surprising that his parents wanted to visit and see the big time.

I took a bite of the cupcake and nodded. “Sure, that’s nice.”

“You should take them to see the Capitol building or maybe down to South Congress. We can check out some Airbnbs in the meantime, things book up fast.”

Leo wrung his fingers, looking at me with his lips pressed tight.

That look always gave me a bad feeling.

Sure enough, the next second he looked miserable. “Sweetheart, um, could they stay at our place?”

“I told my parents I bought a place in the city.”

“You know how it is. I’ve been out of school for five years, and every time they call, they ask if I’ve bought a house yet. I couldn’t take it anymore, so I told them I did.”

“So this trip, they’re mainly coming to see the condo I supposedly bought.”

I stared at Leo, shocked. The man who was so straightforward and honest with me was apparently a total phony with his own family.

He’d actually lied about owning a home in Austin.

Leo clasped his hands together and pleaded, “Sienna, just for the few days they’re here, can we tell them the condo is mine?”

“I promise, they’ll see the place and then they’ll be gone. They definitely won’t bother us.”

I dropped my head, slowly finishing the cupcake spoon by spoon. Only then did I sigh.

Leo was hung up on his image, especially since he was the sole college graduate in the family.

If his parents found out that five years after graduation, he was barely scraping a six-figure salary and was living in his girlfriend’s condo—a condo *her* parents had bought, no less—how could he ever face them again?

Considering Leo’s dignity as a man, I nodded and agreed.

“You have to promise me they’ll only stay a few days.”

“And they are absolutely not to go through any of my things!”

Seeing my agreement, Leo instantly snapped a salute.

“Don’t worry! I will protect all your stuff with my life, I swear they won’t touch a thing.”

“As soon as they leave, I’ll take a week off, and we’ll go on that cruise to the Greek Isles we talked about!”

Leo’s parents arrived on Saturday.

Leo and I went together to pick them up from the airport.

I thought it was just his parents. I didn't expect his Nana and Grandpa to be there too.

The two elderly people trailed behind his mom and dad. His grandpa sounded like he had a cold, coughing as he walked.

He suddenly coughed up a thick wad of phlegm and spat it right onto the pavement.

I nearly gagged up my lunch.

Leo hurried forward to take the suitcases from his parents. I politely followed alongside him and offered a friendly greeting to his mother and father.

They weren't overly warm to me, giving only a quick, dismissive nod.

Our five-seater SUV, with me in it, obviously couldn't fit five people and luggage.

Leo pulled me aside and asked me to take a taxi home.

“Sienna, I’m so sorry. I truly didn’t know Nana and Grandpa were coming. They didn’t tell me.”

“Could you please just tough it out and grab a ride home? I’ll reimburse you for the fare.”

On the other side of the car, Leo’s mom kept calling his name.

Looking at his conflicted expression, I reluctantly nodded, even though I didn’t want to.

It was their family. Me being there would have been awkward.

Seeing that I agreed, Leo threw an arm around me and kissed me.

“I knew you were the best. Wait for me. When my parents leave, I’ll definitely take you on that trip!”

Leo left. His parents walked on his left, his grandparents on his right.

Watching him chat and laugh with them, I realized something: the Leo who complained to me about his company and vented about his boss was, in his parents’ eyes, a successful man of accomplishment.

Taxis were hard to come by at the airport.

By the time I managed to get a ride home, Leo’s parents had already hauled their luggage into the master bedroom.

His grandparents were setting up shop in the second bedroom.

Leo was in the master talking with his parents. When I walked in, the living room was empty.

Only the occasional burst of laughter drifted out from the master suite.

Not wanting to interrupt their family time, I sat on the couch to wait for Leo.

An hour later, Leo and his parents finally emerged.

As soon as he saw me, Leo froze for a split second.

His mother, though, scowled immediately. “You’re still here? Aren’t you going home?”

Hearing her question, Leo rushed to smooth things over. “Mom, Sienna lives here with me now.”

His mother gave a sharp, high-pitched *oh*, then her eyes raked up and down my body disapprovingly. “Moving in together before the parents have even met. Before you’re even engaged.”

“Girls these days really have no respect for themselves.”

“Mom!” Leo shouted, turning to face her.

“Sienna, she doesn’t mean it like that.”

His mother scoffed, then plopped herself down next to me on the sofa.

“You’re living in my son’s condo. Are you paying rent?”

I was stunned and furious. I was about to explode, but Leo squeezed my hand, cutting me off.

Seeing my silence, Leo’s mother assumed I was guilty and pressed on.

“Let me tell you, that’s how women should do it! Get out of college and find a boyfriend who owns a home. Saves on rent!”

“But speaking of that—even though our Leo is a successful guy, his money doesn’t grow on trees.”

“If you want to keep living here, you’ll have to pay rent!”

“After all, whether you two are going to get married is still up for debate!”

“Mom! What are you talking about?”

“Sienna and I have been together for three years. She’s not with me because I own a condo!”

His mother wasn't buying it. “That just means she has good taste, finding a capable man like my son.”

“One who can afford to buy, so she doesn't have to rent!”

Seeing that his mother was about to keep going, Leo jumped up, grabbed my arm, and pulled me toward the study.

“Mom, Dad, you’ve all had a long day traveling. Get some rest tonight.”

As soon as the study door closed, I couldn’t hold back anymore.

“Leo, what was your mom talking about?!”

“Saying we might not get married? Does she look down on me?”

“Or does she think I’m ‘punching above my weight’ because I’m with a guy who *owns a condo*?”

I deliberately emphasized the words *owns a condo*, and Leo’s face instantly flushed red.

He held me, trying to soothe me. “Sienna, please don’t be angry. My mom, she’s just like that!”

“In her eyes, everything I do is perfect! Even if I pass gas, she’d probably compliment the smell.”

“She didn’t mean any harm.”

“If you really can’t stand it, once we’re married, we just won’t live with them, okay?”

“Sienna, you’re the best. Just play along for a few days, and when they leave, I promise I’ll take you somewhere amazing.”

Leo was flattering me and painting me a picture of the future. Though I was hurt, I felt a pang of sympathy for him, struggling to afford a place in Austin after five years, having to use *my* condo to put on a show for his parents.

Rural people simply didn't understand the pressure young professionals faced. They only knew that their college-educated son was working in the big city, earning a high salary, and was therefore successful.

They couldn’t grasp why, with such a good salary, he still couldn’t buy a home in a major city.

I pointed at the narrow daybed in the study and asked Leo, “How are we supposed to sleep on this?”

Leo grinned playfully. “Cuddling up is cozy and warm.”

Seeing the deepening scowl on my face, he quickly changed his tune, offering to sleep on the floor.

So the first night, Leo slept on the floor, and I took the daybed.

The next morning, before dawn, Leo’s mom shoved the door open and walked right in.

Seeing her precious son sleeping on the floor, she was furious. She slapped my face.

“Not only is this little tramp not paying rent, but she’s making my precious boy sleep on the floor!”

“He’s your man! You make him sleep on the floor! Are you insane?!”

Her hand was heavy. The slap woke me instantly.

As I opened my eyes, her other hand was coming down again, but I threw my arm up and grabbed her wrist.

She hadn't expected me to fight back and was so enraged she started yelling abuse. “You brat! You dare hit back!”

“Son! Son, wake up! Your girlfriend is hitting your mother!”

Leo woke up groggy and confused, then saw his mother standing over the bed and instantly sobered.

“Mom! What are you doing!”

“What am I doing? I’m telling your girlfriend to get up and make us breakfast!”

“You two live together—isn’t she supposed to take care of you?”

I didn’t end up making breakfast.

Because his mother kicked me out of the house.

She crammed my clothes haphazardly into a suitcase and shoved me and the roller bag out the front door.

“You don’t pay rent and you make my son sleep on the floor!”

“We don’t want a daughter-in-law like you in the Miller family!”

The moment the door slammed shut, I was stunned. Before I could process it, Leo’s call came in.

He must have been in the bathroom, his voice a low whisper.

He kept apologizing profusely.

“Baby, I’m so sorry, truly sorry!”

“I had no idea my mom would just walk in like that!”

“She just feels bad for me, that’s all. She didn’t mean to kick you out, she just felt bad that I was going to sleep on the floor again!”

“Be a good girl, can you just stay in a hotel today? I’ll cover the cost!”

“Hotel beds are big and soft! They’re definitely more comfortable than that cramped study!”

He quickly Venmo’d me three thousand dollars and told me to stay in a hotel for a few days.

I could come back after his parents left.

I decided not to argue, mostly because of the money, but also because I *did* want to stay in a hotel.

That narrow daybed was an impulse purchase I’d made and never used. Last night was the first time I’d slept on it.

It was small and hard, not comfortable at all.

I immediately found a nice hotel, checked in, and sprawled out on a king-sized bed, scrolling through my phone.

Leo took his parents and grandparents out. His Instagram stories updated periodically.

*This is what all the hard work is for.*

The post was a photo of the five of them together.

Leo spent the entire day with his family.

In his downtime, he still found a moment to send me a couple of concerned texts.

*Babe, did you find a good hotel?*

*I know this is rough. I promise the second my parents leave, I’m coming to get you.*

I told Leo to make sure he sorted out his parents and grandparents quickly, because this was a show I was only going to put on once.

Leo swore he would.

The next day, I checked out of the hotel and went straight to the office.

I’d assumed one day of sightseeing would be enough; surely they would be heading back today.

But around lunchtime, Leo called.

He said his grandpa wasn’t feeling well and wanted to stay longer to see a specialist.

I had a bad feeling and asked him how many more days they planned to stay.

Leo stammered, saying he couldn’t say for sure, but that it would definitely be as soon as possible.

I had no choice but to extend my hotel stay.

By the fifth day, I couldn't take it anymore. I demanded to know when his parents were leaving.

Leo finally told me that his grandfather’s test results had come back, and the prognosis wasn't good.

He might need chemotherapy and subsequent surgery.

“My parents want to stay here until after the surgery.”

“Sienna, we’re going to get married anyway.”

“Can’t you just think of this as a trial run for being family?”
