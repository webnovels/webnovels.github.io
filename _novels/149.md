That summer when I was 18, I found Tyler barely alive in a dirty alley.

Twenty years later, in another summer, he wanted a divorce, abandoning me and our 12-year-old daughter.

His idealized first love, Rachel, clung to his arm with a triumphant smile: "See? After all these years, he still chooses me without hesitation."

Heartbroken and disillusioned, I finally agreed to the divorce.

I burned my wedding dress and threw away the ring he had chosen for me.

I wished him and Rachel eternal happiness and true love.

But later, he pinned me against the wall, our breaths intermingling, his eyes filled with regret as he said he had made a mistake.
