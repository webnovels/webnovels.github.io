In my past life, I took the fall for the Reed family’s foster son and served five years in prison.

But the day I was released, I was greeted by his extravagant birthday party. The Reeds stripped me naked and threw me into a snowdrift, leaving me to freeze to death.

When I opened my eyes again, I was five years old, on the very day my biological parents, the Reeds, were supposed to take me home.

That’s when my sister, Brooke Reed, suddenly burst out. She stood fiercely in the doorway, a desperate barrier, pointing at my tattered clothes.

“Dad, Mom, don’t bring him back! He’ll destroy our family!”

Seeing her reaction, so utterly different from my past life, I instantly knew she had been reborn too.

After my parents left, looking disappointed, she walked up to me and forcefully shoved a piece of candy into my hand, her voice like ice, sharp and cutting.

“The Reeds have enough with one son, Tyler.”

“You, you menace. This time, you should just rot out here.”
