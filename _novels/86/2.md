My mother was waiting in the dressing room. Seeing me come in, she gave me a thumbs up with a smile:

"That's my girl, so fierce!"

I laughed coldly and plopped down on the sofa, crossing my legs.

I've been in the business world for years; I'm not an idiot.

The Thorne family letting Lily humiliate me in public was just a test of obedience.

They're an elite family in the city, with a high social status.

However, in recent years, they've fallen behind the times, and the Thorne Group has declined with weakening revenues.

To raise funds, they had to resort to a business marriage.

And I, a woman with money but no background, was the perfect choice.

They coveted my billion-dollar dowry but couldn't lower themselves to ask me directly.

So they decided to play dirty, trying to manipulate me.

They wanted to use their "noble" status to put me down.

Make this "nouveau riche" feel inferior, so I'd eventually hand over my dowry, begging them to use it.

Thinking about this, I laughed coldly.

It's laughable. Even a dog would shake its head at such audacity.

They thought their plan was perfect, but they didn't realize I'm not some pushover.

I'm a force to be reckoned with.

I was raised by my mother, who caught the wave of economic reform early on.

Back then, she partnered with a few people, started with a steel mill, later invested in the internet, and built a vast fortune.

I've surpassed her, making my mark internationally at a young age.

Many famous clothing brands on the market now are subsidiaries of my company.

The business world is a battlefield, and those who survive are no ordinary people.

My mother and I are both expert arguers.

If it weren't for wanting to make a name for myself in the vast domestic market, I would never have agreed to marry Harrison.

I despise Harrison from the bottom of my heart.

My mother's assistant was undercover at the scene.

The assistant said Mrs. Thorne had arrived, but things hadn't escalated yet, so we should wait in the dressing room.

There were snacks in the dressing room, so my mother and I sat on the sofa.

We munched on seeds while cursing Harrison.

In this society, women who show even a bit of weakness get torn apart by men.

My mother and I have been in business for years, so we know this well.

That's why we're both sharp-tongued and loud when necessary.

We knew there were Thorne family people eavesdropping outside the dressing room, so we cursed even louder.

My mother, coming from a humble background, was especially skilled at cursing.

She screeched and yelled, cursing the Thorne ancestors in every creative way possible.

I fanned the flames, and we kept at it for half an hour before we heard someone outside slam something and leave in frustration.

My mother calmly sipped her tea and said sarcastically:

"I didn't expect them to give up so easily."

"If they knew they couldn't handle it, why bring that little bitch to the wedding? Aren't they just asking to be cursed?"

I smiled and twisted the ring on my finger:

"They're just gluttons for punishment. I heard the Thorne family are all masochists; the more you curse them, the more obedient they become."

My mother nodded in agreement, approving of my assessment.
