Another half hour passed, and still no one came.

I knew the Thorne family couldn't swallow their pride.

They weren't willing to lower their "noble" status to beg a lowly "nouveau riche" like me.

My phone buzzed with a message.

It was from Mrs. Thorne, asking me to forgive Harrison and attend the wedding for her sake.

I laughed coldly.

Your face?

Your face is worth shit!

You don't want to come apologize to me? Fine, let's see this through to the end!

I glanced at the time and decisively called Harrison.

The call connected, and I could hear that Harrison had put it on speaker.

Before Harrison could speak, I started:

"Harrison, I'm giving you five minutes. You, you big scumbag, bring that little tramp you're keeping and come apologize to me in person."

"If you don't, remember that financial bigshot you recently got to manage your assets?"

"Don't forget, my main business is overseas, and I'm quite good in the fund industry."

"From now on, if you dare to be late, I'll become your competitor tonight."

"You short, I'll go long. You go long, I'll short. I've got plenty of money to burn, and I'm not afraid of losses."

"For every minute you're late, I'll make you lose 10 million. I always keep my word."

With that, I hung up, ignoring the shouts from the other end.

Three minutes later, hurried footsteps approached the dressing room, and the door burst open. It was Harrison and Lily.

I sat on the sofa with my legs crossed, watching Harrison reluctantly approach.

When he lowered his head in submission, I turned to look at Lily.

The girl's face was a mess of red and blue, like she'd been through a dye factory.

I put on a fake smile:

"Lily, I know you're just a child, and I can understand your lack of filter."

"It's okay. Once I'm part of the Thorne family, I'll teach you slowly."

I took out a stack of cash from my purse:

"You're the child Harrison keeps by his side, so naturally, I'm your stepmother now."

"Call me 'Mom,' and Mom will give you some money for the new title."

Lily suddenly looked up, her face full of tears as she looked at Harrison.

I smiled sweetly at Lily.

After a moment, Lily gritted her teeth, her eyes full of hatred, but she had to lower her head:

"Mother."

I smiled and tossed the stack of cash in her face:

"Good girl. Mom loves self-respecting girls the most."

"Learn from Mom in the future. Don't let your head be full of men; that's called being boy-crazy, short for mental illness. It needs treatment."

I stood up gracefully, brushed off non-existent dust, and turned to Harrison with a smile:

"What are you standing there for, Harrison? Let's go."
