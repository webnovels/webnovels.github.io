The wedding concluded successfully, and I, Scarlett, became an overnight sensation in the city's upper class.

Slapping both the adopted daughter and the husband at a high-society wedding - what an achievement.

Everyone said I was a badass.

The in-laws originally wanted to put me in my place in front of everyone.

Who knew I'd turn the tables on them, shoving their own shit right back in their faces.

I didn't care what others said. All I knew was that I had become the Thorne family's new matriarch.

On our wedding night, Harrison came to the bedroom, his face dark as the bottom of a pot:

"Scarlett, let me tell you, you may have my body now, but you'll never have my heart!"

I laughed coldly and kicked him off the bed:

"Who wants your pasty pig body? I get nauseous just looking at it!"

"Get out!"

The next day, I woke up feeling refreshed. The first thing I did was gather all the servants of the mansion.

The butler stood in the middle, hands at his sides.

I looked him up and down, then suddenly smiled:

"Who pays your salary now?"

The butler respectfully replied:

"You do, Madam."

I nodded. Seems he's quite sensible.

After he finished, I picked up my teacup and stirred the tea leaves:

"Since you know who feeds you, don't bite the hand that feeds you."

"Be careful, or I'll fire you all. See if those old fools will still want you then!"

As I finished speaking, I looked up to see a few young servants shrinking back, lowering their heads even more.

After the servants dispersed, I looked up to see Harrison standing on the second floor, frowning down at me.

I put my teacup on the table and said slowly:

"If you have something to say, come down. I hate looking up at people."

Hearing this, Harrison came down the stairs, dark circles under his eyes.

The young master had never slept on the floor before. No worries, he'll get used to it soon enough.

Harrison's voice was cold and hard:

"Scarlett, why do you have to be so ruthless?"

I raised an eyebrow:

"Ruthless? This is called employee training."

"If they listen to me and fulfill their responsibilities, of course I won't be stingy."

"Clear rewards and punishments - that's basic business logic."

"You've been in charge of the Thorne family for so long, haven't you learned this yet?"

Seeing my mocking expression, Harrison took a deep breath and changed the subject:

"When are you going to give me that 1.5 billion?"

I was amused and countered:

"My dowry? Why should I give it to you?"

"Did you give me a bride price? What right do you have to ask for my dowry?"

"What do you need my dowry for anyway?"

Faced with my triple question, Harrison clenched his fists and said in a low voice:

"The Thorne family is having some difficulties lately. We're short on funds and need your dowry for investment."

"As for the bride price, we apologize for that."

I laughed out loud on the spot.

A vague "sorry" and you think you can get my 1.5 billion?

Dream on!

I leaned back on the sofa, crossing my legs, and smiled:

"You want my dowry? Sure."

"But every penny you invest, every fund you inject into the Thorne family, has to go through my people."

"Every business move you make needs to be pre-approved by my assistant."

Hearing me say this, Harrison's long-suppressed anger finally exploded:

"Scarlett! Don't go too far!"

"I've never met such a vicious woman like you!"

Seeing him angry, I smashed my teacup on the ground!

CRASH!

I glared at Harrison:

"Harrison, you're quite the hypocrite, aren't you?"

"When your Thorne family was being stingy, not letting me use any resources or connections, you didn't say a word!"

"Now it's my turn, and you're calling me vicious?"

"Let me tell you, for this business marriage, if you want cooperation and mutual resource exchange, I'm fine with that."

"But if you think you can freeload off me, let's see how many lives you have to dare try!"

I stood up, looking down at him:

"I know you like gentle women."

"But your likes mean as much to me as dog shit. There's no difference."

"Think hard about your own business value, show some sincerity, then come talk to me about cooperation."

With that, I left Harrison behind, took the bag the butler handed me, and walked out the door.
