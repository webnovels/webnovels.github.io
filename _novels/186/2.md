I froze, my pupils contracting sharply. The scene before me felt like a sledgehammer to my skull, leaving my breath stuck in my throat.

I had never seen Jude with such intensity, as if he wanted to consume Cora whole. Cora's face was flushed, writhing her waist, letting out soft moans of extreme pleasure.

My face turned ashen, my lips trembled, devoid of any color. My eyes were empty, like a dried-up well, and the air seemed heavy with despair.

How could they be together like this?

I asked myself countless times, and each time, my heart ached more, until it hurt so much that my breath tasted of blood. Only then did I realize the scene before me wasn't a nightmare.

I held the bat tightly, trying not to drop it, but my body felt weak, as if unraveling, collapsing to the ground. My nails dug deeply into my palms, blood seeping out without me noticing.

"Darling, once tomorrow is over, the company will be ours. I've waited for this day for a long time."

"If it weren't for you enduring the humiliation to marry Nora, we wouldn't have today. Thank you, my dear."

"As long as I can make you the true heir of the Sullivan family, I'll do anything. I've had enough of being Nora's dog. I only love you."

"Today, that woman angered Dad over your shares. Dad's already handed the company over to me. Our scheme to sow discord is really paying off. Soon, they'll all be under my feet!"

In their moment of passion, they laughed heartily, their sweet words interrupted by the sound of kissing.

Curled up in the corner, I tugged at my hair, my knuckles turning white, a broken sob escaping my throat.

The man I loved deeply was conspiring with an illegitimate daughter to scheme against me and my family!

Was his sincerity in marrying me just for Cora? Those scars, those times of enduring humiliation, were they not for me at all?

I was filled with hate, but the most painful and despairing thing was that Jude wasn't wooing me for power, but for another woman! The love that moved me, that I was grateful for, was all for Cora!

The one I loved was always the false him, his deep affection was for another woman.

I don't know how I got back to my bedroom, my legs felt like they were filled with lead, dragging me into an abyss.

Jude and Cora didn't stop until dusk, sweaty and laughing, they mocked me as they passed my room.

"Good thing Nora isn't home, otherwise how would we have such a pleasant afternoon."

"I'm only happy when I'm with you. Seeing her face disgusts me."

They laughed together, their flirtatious voices fading until I heard the door close. The house became eerily silent, allowing me to finally breathe and cry out in pain.

"Why do this to me?"

I gritted my teeth, pounding the bed, then suddenly lifted my head. My eyes, bloodshot, fixed on the wedding photo on the wall. I grabbed a nearby ornament and smashed it.

The glass shattered all over the floor. I frantically picked up a fruit knife and scratched Jude's face on the photo until I was too exhausted to cry anymore. I slumped to the ground, noticing the fresh cuts on my hand.

I smirked bitterly at my foolishness, for truly believing his sincerity.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the share transfer document on the bed. An idea sparked in my mind.

Since Jude and Cora knew I'd give the shares to Jude tomorrow as a gift, and she was so eager to be the Sullivan heir, I had to prepare a grand gift!

"Dear, I won't be home tonight. Still got work to do. See you at the inauguration ceremony tomorrow morning."

Jude sent a cute emoticon, making me want to vomit. He couldn't even keep up the act before taking office, not wanting to spend another second with me.

I snorted coldly and replied with a simple "Okay."

The next morning, I packed the gift I had prepared for Jude into a gift box and tossed it into the back seat of the car before heading to the company.

"Honey, you're here." Jude's eyes lit up as he adjusted his suit cuffs.

"Of course, I have to be here for your big day."

I subtly linked my arm with his to lower his guard.

"Sister, I thought you'd never come back to the company."

Cora swayed over, giving Jude a meaningful look before quickly turning away.

"How could I not? I'm the only heir of the Sullivan family after all."

I smiled with hidden intent, seeing Cora's face stiffen with jealousy.

Jude quickly interrupted our conversation, as his inauguration ceremony was about to start.

My dad and all the board members would be present. I finally understood why he always talked about the shares. In such a setting, if I gave him some of the Sullivan shares, it would indirectly acknowledge him as the family son-in-law, which was a huge boon for him and Cora.

Thinking of this, I showed a deep smile.

"I'm very happy to become a member of the Sullivan Group's board of directors today. None of this would be possible without my wife, Nora. Thank you for your support and companionship. In the future, we will work hand in hand to achieve great things!"

From Jude's enthusiastic voice, you could tell how proud he was.

After he finished speaking, I took the prepared gift box and went on stage.

"I'm very pleased with Jude reaching this position, so I specially prepared a gift for Mr. Jude."

With that, I handed the gift box to Jude.

"Thank you, honey." He smiled broadly, thinking it contained the share transfer document.

He took a deep breath, smiling as he opened the box.

Instantly, the smile vanished, the box fell, and Jude was shocked.

Inside the box was our divorce certificate.
