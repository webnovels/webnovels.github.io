"Honey, look at this."

On a rainy night, I changed into a light nightgown and handed the document to Jude, who was still working.

"Why aren't you asleep yet? I have a lot of work tonight; don't let it disturb your rest."

Jude held me close, not even glancing at the document in my hand, his heart and eyes full of me.

"Take a look at what this is."

I gently blocked his attempt to kiss me, nodding towards the text on the table.

Jude looked at me curiously, unsure of the little game I was playing.

"This is..."

Jude's smile widened, filled with surprise and excitement.

"The Vice Chairman's appointment letter!"

Jude exclaimed, almost standing up in excitement, nearly dropping me in the process.

"Honey, I love you so much! How did you convince those old fossils?"

Jude's eyes sparkled with joy as he kissed my cheek.

"It wasn't that hard. Although my dad threatened to cut ties with me, blood is thicker than water. Promoting you is also for my own good."

I lowered my eyes, happy for him.

Jude is the son of our family's chauffeur, from a humble background. My dad ordered us to break up, but I defied my whole family and married him.

Because of his sincerity, he knelt for days in the rain to marry me, becoming gravely ill and recovering only with difficulty.

He also shielded me when my dad raised a stick, leaving scars on his back and nearly breaking his arm.

What finally convinced me to marry him was the car accident, where he protected me and was in a coma, his life hanging by a thread.

I was hopelessly in love and immediately chose to elope with him, marrying him without hesitation, even if it made me a laughingstock in all of Seattle and a topic of gossip in the business world. As long as I was with Jude, I'd be happy.

"You've worked hard."

I gently caressed the scar on his arm from saving me, my heart softening.

"As long as it's for you, it's not hard. I will make Mr. Sullivan see me in a new light and acknowledge me as his son-in-law!"

Jude pressed his forehead against mine, holding me tightly.

"Honey, this appointment ceremony is all thanks to you. I'll love you forever."

"Me too."

I replied sweetly, squeezing his hand.

After marriage, I used all my business knowledge and natural talent to help him climb to his current position.

Everyone said he married me for the Sullivan family's power and to take over my company, but I didn't think so. Even though I helped him climb, he treated me as he always did, caring for me tenderly, never frequenting nightlife, and keeping his phone clean, giving me a sense of security.

"By the way, Nora, there's something I'm worried about."

Jude furrowed his brows, seeming troubled.

"Just tell me, there's no need to hide anything between us."

Jude sighed: "Ultimately, it's because I'm useless. I even have to ask you for help with this. I'm worried that even if I meet the board, I'll be ostracized because I have no real power or shares. I don't mind, but I'm afraid they'll talk about you."

Jude lowered his head in disappointment, showing a dissatisfied look with himself.

"I'd like to see who dares to talk. You're the best. You need to believe in yourself. Mainly, the Sullivan family didn't agree to our marriage. Even though my dad turns a blind eye to my little moves, this matter of shares isn't easy to resolve."

I bit my lower lip, feeling worried.

"It's okay, Nora. I'm already content to have you by my side. I'm a man; I must solve these things myself."

After speaking, he groaned in pain, and I quickly massaged his temples.

"Is your head hurting again? You've been working hard for the company lately."

"It's not hard. Thinking about how you betrayed your family for me makes me feel guilty. I vowed to make you happy, so these hardships are nothing to me."

Jude looked at me with tender affection. Deep in his emotions, he suddenly kissed me, followed by a storm of passion, leaving me weak all over, unable to lift a finger afterward.

"When Mr. Sullivan acknowledges me, we'll have a child."

Jude gently rubbed my sore waist, flirting in my ear.

I blushed, pouting playfully, without responding.

The next morning, Jude left for the company early. I was still worried about the shares and planned to swallow my pride and visit the Sullivan family.

"You still know how to come back!"

As soon as I entered, a teacup was thrown at my feet, water splashing on my skirt.

"Dad..."

I moved my lips, lowering my head in shame: "I'm your daughter, why can't I come back?"

"Didn't you say you wanted to cut ties with me to marry that poor boy? What are you doing back here now?"

My dad was coughing in anger, and Cora immediately went up to pat his back.

Cora is the illegitimate daughter. My mom, kind-hearted, took her in after learning she was gravely ill. For this, my dad always felt guilty towards my mom and me.

"Don't be angry, Dad. Sister came back with good intentions to see you."

Cora was gentle and well-mannered. After I left home, she became deeply favored by my father, always by his side learning the company affairs.

"Dad, I came back this time to discuss something with you."

I coldly glanced at Cora, who seemed unwilling to leave.

"What do you need from the Sullivan family? How capable are you?"

My dad scolded me with a reproachful look. Though he was angry about my involvement with the chauffeur's son, he couldn't bring himself to abandon me out of guilt.

"I suddenly want to eat Aunt May's snacks. Cora, please tell Aunt May for me."

I found an excuse to send Cora away. She seemed reluctant but still poured new tea for my dad before leaving.

After she left, my dad lowered his gaze to me, quietly waiting for me to state my purpose.

"You must have helped Jude successfully join the board, right?"

I got straight to the point without any pleasantries.

"From the bottom of my heart, I look down on that punk. Letting him join the board is already my mercy. But I'm warning you, if there's any mistake, you both can get lost!"

My dad said harshly, but there was no hatred in his eyes.

"I'm here this time also for the board's matter. I know I've been unfilial, unable to make you happy, but Jude truly has the company's best interests at heart. He's been devoted to it for three years since we married, so I hope you can put aside your bias and give him a chance."

"What's your purpose?"

My dad abruptly interrupted, his sharp eyes staring at me ominously.

"Shares."

I spoke cautiously, watching my dad's facial changes.

As expected, he raised the teacup in his hand, ready to throw it at me.

"Unfilial daughter! If you were half as reliable as your sister, I wouldn't be getting worse! How dare you come back asking for shares!"

"Dad, you should know those uncles and aunts on the board aren't easy to deal with. I've worked hard to get Jude to where he is today. Should I let him be bullied? I know you have animosity towards him, but we're already married. Please, for my and Mom's sake, help us this once."

I stepped forward, respectfully bowing to my father.

"Do you know what you're saying? You're giving Sullivan family shares to an outsider! I always suspected that kid had ulterior motives. I don't know what spell he's cast on you!"

Hearing my mom's name, my dad's tone softened a bit. He anxiously tried to dissuade me, hoping I'd come to my senses.

"In the three years since marrying him, he's never wronged me. I know my own heart in these matters, Dad, there's no need to persuade me anymore. I just want some shares to pave the way for him. I'll do whatever it takes."

My dad opened his mouth but said nothing, just clenched his fist and slammed it on the table.

"Forget it. Some things can't be taught by others; experience teaches better. I hope you won't regret it in the future."

My dad took a deep breath, letting out a heavy sigh.

Hearing my mom's name, my dad's tone softened. He anxiously tried to dissuade me, hoping I'd reconsider.

"In the three years I've been married to him, he's never done anything to betray me. I know what I'm doing, Dad, you don't need to persuade me anymore. I just want some shares. As long as I can smooth the path for him, I'll do anything."

I opened my mouth to speak, but no words came out. Instead, I clenched my fist and pounded it on the table.

"Fine, some lessons can't be taught by others—only experience can teach them. I hope you won't regret this in the future."

My dad took a deep breath and sighed heavily.

"If you're determined to be with that young man, then don't meddle in the company's affairs anymore. I'll give you the shares, consider it my way of making amends to you and your mom."

My dad rubbed his temples wearily, showing a pained expression.

"Thank you, Dad. I believe Jude will make you proud."

"Leave now, I don't want to see you anymore."

My dad ordered me out, and everyone in the Sullivan family ignored me. They even whispered behind my back as I passed by. But I was used to all of this. One day, I'd prove to my father that my choice was right.

I returned home excitedly with the share transfer document, planning to surprise Jude after work.

As soon as I got home, before even changing my clothes, I noticed a pair of high heels at the entryway. They were the ones Jude gifted me.

"Why aren't these shoes on the rack?"

I placed them neatly on the shoe rack, thinking I must have been careless and forgot them in my hurry. I didn't think much of it.

Tomorrow was Jude's inauguration ceremony. I planned to give him the share transfer document as a gift. Imagining his ecstatic expression made me smile sweetly.

"Jude, you're hurting me."

I was about to make a sumptuous dinner for Jude to celebrate when suddenly, I heard faint moaning from upstairs.

I was startled. No one should be home at this time.

For safety, I grabbed a baseball bat and cautiously went upstairs.

The sounds came from the study. The coquettish female voice and deep breathing were unmistakable. I didn't need to guess what was happening.

I gripped the bat tightly, slowly approaching the study door. To my surprise, there was a crack. Peering through, I witnessed a scene that I'd never forget!

A man and woman intertwined, moving rhythmically.

And the main characters were my husband and Cora!
