Ryan, my brother-in-law, was bitten by a venomous snake while collecting firewood in the woods behind our house. His life hung by a thread.

The local hospital was short on antivenom, and the key to the office storing it had been taken by my wife, Sophia Thompson.

I begged her to come back and save Ryan, but she wouldn't believe me.

"Jack, stop making things up! I just video called my brother an hour ago!"

"Being bitten by a snake? What kind of ridiculous lie is that?"

She hung up on my plea for help. By the time we got the antivenom, Ryan had already died from the venom.

When Sophia saw Ryan's body, she lost her mind.
