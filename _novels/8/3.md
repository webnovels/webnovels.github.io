"No, don't hit me! I'll be good. I'll take it off..."
Christie was crying in her sleep, whimpering like a frightened animal.
Hearing her muttered dream-talk felt like someone had carved a hole straight through my chest.
I still remember the day Mom told me I was going to have a little sister named Christie. From that moment on, I couldn't stop imagining her.
Every morning before school, I'd whisper to Mom's belly.
And after school, while other kids ran off to play, I always rushed home, hoping to feel her kick.
I waited ten long months.
And when I finally held her, I made a silent vow: I would be the best big sister in the world.
Anything she wanted, I'd make it happen, no matter what it cost me.
But I never got the chance. She was swapped before I could watch her grow.
And the one I protected, pampered, and loved for over twenty years was a fake.
Worse, after Christie came back, I still helped that imposter bully her.
The more I thought about it, the sicker I felt. I slapped myself hard a few times.
[Wait, is Tania's character breaking? What's with the sudden switch?]
[No, this isn't a breakdown. It's a breakthrough.]
[Breakthrough or not, a few slaps won't make up for years of abuse.]
The comments rolled in like Judgment Day.
My face burned as I read them.
They were right. What mattered now was figuring out how to make it right.
If the bullet points were anything to go by, Betty wasn't done scheming.
And with Lionel still firmly on her side, even my help might not be enough to keep Christie safe.
She needed to protect herself.
I spent the night weighing my options. And finally, I made a decision: I'd help her train to build her strength, confidence, and independence.
When I explained it to her, she didn't hesitate for a second.
"You know it's going to be hard, right? Like, really hard," I warned. "You sure you're ready?"
Christie nodded, eyes blazing with something I'd never seen in her before. "I've never been more sure of anything. I've learned the hard way; no one's coming to save me. I have to save myself.
"I've always wanted to learn many things. My adoptive parents tried their best.
"But they could barely afford my schooling, let alone anything extra. I never dared ask for more.
"Now that I finally have a chance, I'll take it. Even if it kills me."
