I was obsessed with Liam for two years after we got married. He hated me.

How much did he hate me?

I was in a car accident, fractured multiple bones, and ended up staying in their hospital for half a year. He, a prominent orthopedic surgeon, never visited me once.

No one liked me. Everyone said I was the one who drove Sierra away, that I was a heartless monster.

Right after the accident, when I couldn't move, everyone around him felt relieved for him.

"Liam, you're finally free for a while."

When it was time for me to be discharged, his friends all breathed a sigh of relief on his behalf.

"Chloe's getting out. She's going to torment Liam again."

True to their word, the first thing I did after being discharged was find Liam.

But it wasn't to cling to him anymore.

Instead, I handed him a document.

"Liam, this is what you wanted."

"What?"

I smiled softly.

"Open it and see for yourself… Liam, I don't want the house, I don't want the car. I wish you even greater success in the future. I hope our paths never cross again."

After handing over the divorce papers, I stepped back and melted into the crowd.
