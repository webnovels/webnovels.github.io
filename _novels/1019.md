According to Ashford University records, I, Sienna Torres, was classified as an underprivileged student.

On the first day of school, my roommate, Natalie Parker, pulled me aside and told me how to survive on the campus.

"Sienna, listen carefully. There are two types of people at this school," she said in a hushed tone, pointing out the window at a red Ferrari roaring past.

She continued, "The first type are ordinary people like us, who got in through sheer hard work. And the others are those born with a silver spoon in their mouth, who drive supercars to campus. Especially the group led by Lucas Hartley, the student council president. You must stay far away from them."

Natalie's expression turned serious as she added, "They're a bunch of monsters who love to play this sick game called the 'Cupid Blind Box'."

I paused with the glass halfway to my lips and looked at her.

"What kind of game is that?" I asked.

She realized that I wasn't taking her seriously, and her voice trembled with urgency.

"They make a list of pretty female students from ordinary backgrounds. Then, they will write their names on cards and put them in a box.

"Whatever name the scions draw, he has to seduce her within a month and make her fall head over heels with him."

As she said that, Natalie's face twisted with disgust and fear.

"On the last day of the one-month deadline, he'll dump her in front of everyone in the most humiliating way possible. They call it 'prey taming'. Whoever makes his target cry the most bitterly during the breakup is the winner."

She clutched my arm tightly and continued, "Last semester, a senior from our department was chosen. One month later, she found out she was pregnant. Then, that scion's fiancée slapped and humiliated her in public. 

"That senior couldn't take it and jumped off the academic building. In the end, she and her unborn child were killed. Sienna, you're gorgeous. Please be careful and don't get targeted by them."

I reached out and patted Natalie's tense shoulder.

"Don't worry. I'm just here to focus on my studies," I replied, giving her a reassuring smile.

She looked into my eyes, and something in my expression made her shiver.

…

At an exclusive private club that evening, Bella White giggled as she shook a box.

"Lucas, it's your turn to draw. Let's see which lucky woman gets your attention this time."

Lucas was lounging on the couch with a glass of red wine, looking languid and elegant. He glanced dismissively at the box, showing no interest.

She shoved the box right up to him and spoke sweetly, insisting, "Come on. Just pick one. I've added a top-notch entry this time. There's an underprivileged student in the art department named Sienna Torres. She's as gorgeous as a fairy. It'll be so satisfying to win her over and then dump her."

Hearing that, Lucas reached into the box and pulled out a card labeled "Sienna Torres". He stared at it for a moment, then a knowing smile spread across his face.

"Fine," he said. "I'll play with her this month."
