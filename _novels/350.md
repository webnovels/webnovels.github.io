"It was 1979. At eighteen, with both my parents gone, I headed north alone, hoping to find a home with my fiancé, Simon Coolidge.

Simon, decked out in his military uniform, looked at me, taking in my old-fashioned clothes.

He turned to his sweetheart, and said, ""She's just a housekeeper my parents hired from back home.""

Last time, I'd pulled out the engagement ring and exposed his lie right then and there.

His sweetheart, humiliated, stormed off and married Simon's rival, only to be tormented to death.

Simon married me, and he tormented me for a lifetime. I got pregnant seven times, miscarried seven times.

Until the doctor told me I could never have children.

Then Simon, choking me, sneered, ""You killed my sweetheart. You don't deserve to have my babies.""

Knowing the truth, I stabbed Simon with a scalpel in despair and jumped from the eighteenth floor.

I opened my eyes to Simon telling his sweetheart, ""She's just a housekeeper my parents hired from back home.""

I swallowed the bitterness in my heart and nodded. ""Yes, I'm the Coolidges' housekeeper.""

Simon Coolidge, this time, we're done!"
