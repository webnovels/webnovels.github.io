In the private room, only Ethan and I remained.

He was indeed drunk, his eyes unfocused, his usually pale face flushed an unnatural red.

He approached me step by step, calling my name in a low voice.

"Lily, you're mine, only mine..."

He wanted to forcibly possess me.

At this moment, I was eerily calm.

Just as his lips were about to fall, I didn't dodge. Instead, I raised my hand and, using all my strength, delivered a precise chop to the back of his neck.

Bang—!

Ethan's tall figure collapsed softly, unconscious.

I panted heavily, looking at him lying on the ground, without a shred of pity in my heart.

The night was long.

I sat on the sofa, quietly watching Ethan sleeping on the floor.

During this time, I felt that suffocating love emanating from him.

It was a hundred, no, a thousand times more intense than Lucas's.

It felt like countless invisible chains binding and suffocating me.

In my previous life, it was in the mental hospital that I felt Lucas's disgust after his love was stolen, dying in despair.

And in this life, I wanted Emma to personally experience what it was like to be wrapped in this kind of distorted love.

Time passed minute by minute, second by second.

Finally, just before dawn, I felt the heavy feeling on my body suddenly being forcibly pulled away!

What followed was an unprecedented sense of lightness.

I smiled.

Emma, you finally made your move.

Almost at the same time, there was a soft click from the door lock.

The door opened.

Emma stood in the doorway. Seeing me unharmed, she was visibly stunned.

"Lily! Are you okay? I... I accidentally lost the key last night and spent all night looking for the spare key."

"You and Ethan... how are things?"

As she spoke, she anxiously looked into the room, searching for Ethan.

I played along with her act, putting on a heartbroken expression, my eyes instantly reddening.

"We... we broke up," I choked out. "When he woke up, it was like he had become a different person. He said he had no feelings for me anymore and told me to get lost."

Hearing this, Emma's eyes instantly filled with poorly concealed triumph and wild joy.

She forcefully suppressed her upturned lips and came over to hug me with fake concern. "Lily, don't be sad. You're better off without a man like that! He doesn't deserve you! It's not worth crying over someone like him!"

"Mm..." I buried my face in her shoulder, revealing a victorious smile where she couldn't see.

"I'm going to leave now. I need some time alone."

I pushed her away and walked out, looking lost and dejected.

Emma almost eagerly saw me off.

I didn't actually go far, but hid around the corner of the hallway, coldly observing.

Sure enough, as soon as I left, she immediately tidied her hair and clothes, and with a smile of certainty on her face, pushed open the door and entered the private room.

The door wasn't completely closed, leaving a small gap.

Soon, I heard a man's deep, suppressed voice, and a woman's coquettish laughter from inside.

"Mr. Ethan, you're awake?"

"...Who are you?"
