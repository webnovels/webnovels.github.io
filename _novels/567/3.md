The news of me getting together with Ethan spread even faster and wider than when I had dumped Lucas.

The entire school was in an uproar.

"Oh my God, has Lily lost her mind? Dumping Lucas to go after Ethan?"

"Does she think Ethan is as good-natured as Lucas? Just wait, she'll be a wreck within three days."

"I bet a week before she comes running back to Lucas, crying for reconciliation."

I became the laughingstock of the entire school, with everyone waiting to see how this drama would unfold.

Lucas, whom I had ruthlessly dumped, finally couldn't take it anymore when he heard the news.

He burst into my classroom, his eyes bloodshot, and confronted me in front of everyone.

"Lily! What the hell are you trying to do?!"

He pointed at me, his voice filled with the anger of betrayal.

"You broke up with me just to be with him? Why are you torturing yourself like this?!"

Before I could respond, Emma immediately stepped forward, putting on an act of deep concern.

"Lucas, calm down." She held Lucas back but turned to scold me, "Lily, how could you be so foolish!"

"Throwing away someone as good as Lucas, and for what? To go after someone like Ethan? What's he worth that makes you do this?"

"As your best friend, no matter how much you hate me, I have to knock some sense into you!"

She stood on her moral high ground, speaking righteously, as if she truly had my best interests at heart.

The classmates around us chimed in.

"That's right, Lily. Emma's right, you should break up with Ethan right away!"

"Lucas treats you so well, don't be stupid."

I looked at this farce unfolding before me and found it laughable.

"Lucas, you're already in the past. Why can't I start a new life?" I then turned to Emma, my eyes full of mockery: "And you, Emma, do you live by the sea? Why are you so concerned with everyone's business?"

Emma's face turned pale instantly, probably not expecting me to publicly embarrass her like this.

Lucas was so angry he was shaking all over, trembling so much he couldn't utter a word.

Suddenly, a male voice rang out.

"Since when did my girlfriend become someone you could lecture?"

Ethan was leaning against the doorframe, hands in his pockets, looking at everyone present.

He slowly walked to my side, naturally shielding me behind him.

His gaze fell on Lucas, and he immediately launched into a tirade of mockery.

"Losing to me isn't shameful."

"After all, whether it's family background or looks, you're far behind. Instead of barking here like a defeated dog, why don't you go look in a mirror and see why you got dumped?"

Lucas was humiliated to the point of turning red, he glared at me fiercely before turning and running out.

At this moment, I noticed Emma's gaze was glued to Ethan, even more intensely than when she used to look at Lucas.

I smirked coldly. The fish had taken the bait.

From that day on, she no longer tried to persuade me to get back together with Lucas. Instead, she began to do everything she could to promote my relationship with Ethan.

She revealed almost all of my preferences to Ethan.

From small things like my favorite color to big things like what kind of person I liked.

Ridiculously, Ethan actually listened to Emma's advice and molded himself into a perfect boyfriend.

Until one day at a class gathering, Emma deliberately locked me, who had drunk too much, in an empty private room with Ethan.

As she closed the door, she turned back and gave me a meaningful smile.

She thought that after tonight, Ethan's love for me would reach its peak.

Then she could reap the benefits and steal all of this intense love.

She wasn't wrong.

But what she didn't know was that I had been waiting for this moment too.
