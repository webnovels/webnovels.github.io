The news of me dumping Lucas spread like wildfire across the campus.

I became a heartless woman in everyone's eyes, ungrateful and playing with feelings.

Wherever I went, I could feel the pointing fingers and whispers behind my back.

"That's her, the one who dumped Lucas, such a good boyfriend."

"I heard she's just riding a donkey to find a horse, must have found someone richer."

"Who would have thought, she seemed so quiet usually, but she's so manipulative."

I didn't care about any of this.

These rumors and gossip, compared to the electroshock therapy and torture I endured in the mental hospital in my previous life, were like a gentle breeze.

Emma had been buzzing around me like a fly these past couple of days, earnestly trying to persuade me to get back together with Lucas.

She kept hinting at how miserable Lucas was, how he couldn't live without me.

"Lily, Lucas hasn't been able to eat for days. He's lost so much weight. Can you really bear to see him like this?" She held my hand, speaking with apparent sincerity. "You two were the campus's golden couple. Don't give up because of some small misunderstanding."

I pulled my hand away, looking into her hypocritical eyes, finding it all so ridiculous.

"If you care about him so much, why don't you date him yourself?" I said flatly.

Emma's face froze for a moment before she quickly recovered.

"I'm saying this for your own good. I'm your best friend. I can't stand by and watch you make a mistake."

"Oh, really?" I smiled. "Then I should thank you for your kind intentions."

I ignored her and walked straight towards the campus basketball court.

On the court, one figure stood out.

He was tall, with skin so pale it was almost sickly. His eyes were startlingly black, with a beauty mark under them that gave him an otherworldly allure.

He wasn't playing basketball, just leaning lazily against the hoop. Within a three-meter radius around him, there was no one else.

This was Ethan, from a prestigious family background, but with a volatile temperament and unpredictable mood swings. He was the epitome of a yandere.

In my previous life, I had heard about his exploits. A girl who had dated him for less than a month was forced to transfer schools.

I took a deep breath, walked across the court, and stood in front of Ethan.

He seemed to sense someone's presence and lazily lifted his eyelids. Those pitch-black eyes fell on me, carrying a hint of scrutiny and impatience.

"What do you want?" His voice was as cold and indifferent as his person.

I looked straight into his eyes and said word by word:

"I've broken up with Lucas. Now I'm agreeing to be your girlfriend."

As soon as I finished speaking, Ethan was stunned.

He slowly straightened up, looking down at me with a playful smile tugging at his lips.

"Didn't you say you were deeply in love with Lucas when I pursued you before?"

"What, now you're willing to break up with him?"

Ethan's words suddenly reminded me of the time I had spent with Lucas over the past few years.

Back then, we were very much in love, but that was before Emma transferred Lucas's love away.

I tried to keep my voice as calm as possible, "Not interested? If not, forget it."

I was about to turn and leave when he suddenly chuckled softly.

"Of course I'm interested."

As soon as he finished speaking, Ethan's lips came crashing down on mine.
