"Lily, I love you!"

The deafening confession, accompanied by the screams of the crowd around us, yanked me back to reality.

My boyfriend, Lucas, was holding a bouquet of golden roses, professing his love to me.

Cheers erupted from all sides.

"Say yes! Say yes!"

I was momentarily dazed before realizing I had been reborn.

I had returned to the day when Lucas was about to publicly declare his love for me in front of the entire school with 999 roses.

In my previous life, I had waited here, full of anticipation, for him to approach me.

But just when he was one step away from me, he suddenly turned and handed that bouquet to my best friend, Emma, who was standing behind me.

I could never forget that moment.

The love in Lucas's eyes that was originally meant for me extinguished in an instant, only to reignite when he turned towards Emma.

Later, I learned that Emma had an app on her phone that could steal love.

It was her, like a thief, who stole Lucas's love for me.

And now, history seemed to be repeating itself.

I could even sense Emma behind me, quietly raising her phone, ready to use her old trick again.

The cheering around us grew louder, and Lucas's smile became more radiant.

I beat him to the punch, saying in an extremely calm tone: "Lucas, let's break up."

Everyone's expressions froze, and the cheering came to an abrupt halt.

Lucas's smile stiffened, and he looked at me in disbelief, as if he hadn't heard clearly.

"Lily, what... what did you say?"

"I said, let's break up," I repeated, my tone as cold as ice. "I don't like you anymore. I've lost feelings for you."

These words exploded like a bomb in the crowd.

"What the hell? What's going on? Has Lily gone crazy?"

"Lucas treats her so well, everyone knows that. How can she say break up?"

"Is she playing hard to get? That's too cruel!"

Lucas's face instantly turned pale. His hands holding the flowers trembled slightly, and the deep affection in his eyes was replaced by immense shock and pain.

"Why? Lily, tell me why? Did I do something wrong? I can change!"

In my previous life, I had also pleaded with him like this, only to be met with his disgust.

Now, it was his turn to experience this pain.

"Lily!" A hand grabbed my arm. It was Emma, looking at me anxiously.

"Don't be impulsive! You and Lucas have such a good relationship, how can you break up just like that? Quickly apologize to him, stop fooling around."

I looked at her hypocritical face and laughed coldly in my heart.

She was panicking, as expected.

I suddenly understood that her app probably could only transfer the love of my current boyfriend.

Once I broke up with Lucas, she wouldn't be able to steal anything.

That's why she was so anxious to persuade us to reconcile.

I forcefully shook off her hand, abandoning the weakness of my previous life, and stared at her with a piercing gaze.

"My business is none of your concern."

With that, I turned and pushed my way through the crowd, leaving behind a commotion and Lucas's heartbroken calls.
