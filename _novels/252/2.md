The driver took me home. It was late, and Celeste hadn't returned. I didn't ask.
The next day, her assistant delivered her gifts: two commercial property deeds.
She had specifically emphasized that one was compensation for forcing me to lick the cream, and the other was an apology for making me do the 'Egg Challenge.'
I expressionlessly labeled the deeds 96 and 97, then casually tossed them into the safe.
Next to me, Mrs. Davis, the servant, gave a knowing, doting smile.
"Madam Kingston certainly spoils you, Mr. Hayes. These gifts are becoming more and more frequent."
I smiled without a word.
She didn't know these were just Celeste's compensations each time she hurt me.
Looking at the overflowing safe, I knew I would be leaving soon.
But before I left, I only wanted to take one thing: a camera containing something I had to destroy.
Celeste had a strong exploratory curiosity when it came to intimacy. In moments of passion, she would impulsively use the camera to record us.
Before, those videos were just a part of our marital fun.
But now, I didn't want them to remain. If they were ever exposed, my life would be ruined.
I searched every corner of the room, but I couldn't find the camera.
Just as I was about to search again, Mr. Harrison, my agent, called, his voice booming with rage.
"Asher Hayes, have you lost your mind? Look online, private photos of you are everywhere! How dare you secretly accompany other wealthy women behind Celeste's back? If you want to die, don't drag the whole company down with you!"
In an instant, my mind exploded. I only heard my agent's last line.
"You'd better give me an explanation for the online videos immediately! And Celeste's fury... otherwise, we'll haunt you even from the grave!"
The call ended. I quickly opened my phone.
The top trend was a series of my private videos.
And the bold, explosive headline: **[International Supermodel Asher Hayes Sleeps His Way To The Top]**.
Celeste was pixilated, but my face was clearly visible in the center, flushed with desire.
Millions of netizens were online, spewing hateful comments, calling me a slut for sleeping with multiple wealthy women for resources, a man who could be used by anyone.
My legs gave out, and I collapsed to the floor.
But in the last moment of exhaustion, Celeste, who had suddenly appeared, firmly caught me in her arms.
"Don't look at those. It's okay. I'll handle it. Trust me!"
Her comforting words had barely faded when she turned, her face cold, and roared at everyone in the room.
"Who did this! Tell me! Who did this!"
Seeing her raw, unbridled fury, my eyes instantly stung with tears.
At the same time, Leo's casual voice drifted into the room.
"Celeste, you mean the videos? I uploaded them!"
The hand wrapped around my waist tightened abruptly. Celeste and I simultaneously looked at Leo.
"Don't look at me like that! I just happened to see them and thought Asher's body was too amazing to be seen only by you, Celeste. What a waste! So I took it upon myself to share them!"
"After all, beautiful things are meant to be shared for everyone to enjoy, right?"
Immediately, blood rushed to my head. I stood up to slap Leo, but Celeste firmly caught my hand.
"Asher! That's enough!"
I was grief-stricken and furious. I shouted, "But he..."
To my surprise, before I could finish, Celeste glanced at a triumphant Leo, then turned back to me, frowning.
"I'll have the trending topics taken down. This matter ends here. Don't cause trouble for Leo, okay? You know, he's just..."
"No! Celeste, why should I let it go?! He's ruined my reputation! Why should I let it go?!"
"I'm going to sue him for defamation! He has to pay for this!"
My bloodshot eyes met Celeste's, refusing to back down even an inch.
"Asher! You!"
Celeste took a sharp breath, about to continue persuading me.
But Leo tugged at Celeste's sleeve, feigning sobs, his eyes red.
"Celeste! Don't say anymore. I know I was wrong. Just let Asher sue me. It's my fault for being jealous, jealous that Asher married you. It's all my fault! If only I had tried harder back then!"
As he spoke, Leo's eyes turned red, and he actually started to sob.
"Asher, I truly know I was wrong. I'll get on my knees and apologize to you. Please, don't make things difficult for Celeste."
"Whatever makes you happy. I'll go confess right now and clear your name! What's the worst that can happen? I'll be ruined too. But please, don't let this ruin your relationship with Celeste."
Seeing Leo about to kneel to me, Celeste's eyes turned icy again, and she said to me in a low voice:
"Asher! Leo already knows he made a mistake. It's best to be merciful when you can."
"Anyway, your reputation is already gone. Why don't you just retire from the industry and live a life of leisure as a wealthy young man at home? Wouldn't that be better?"
I was shocked by her blindness, disbelieving that Celeste would still indulge him to this extent.
I was about to say more, but the next second, I received a stinging slap across my face. My cheek burned.
Her knuckles were red, her breathing ragged, and a never-before-seen violence surged in her eyes.
She threw a disclaimer at me.
"Be a good boy and sign this. Once the storm passes, I'll help you make a comeback."
"But if you dare to call the police again, don't even think about stepping out of this door!"
"I won't sign!"
I gritted my teeth, staring fiercely at her.
But no matter how I struggled, how I refused to sign, Celeste forcibly pressed my handprint onto the disclaimer.
The moment I collapsed to the floor, exhausted.
An unprecedented sense of powerlessness and piercing pain swept over my entire body, like a thousand needles pricking my heart.
They left, their casual conversation like venomous insects burrowing into my ears:
"Celeste, is Asher okay...?"
"He's fine. As long as he wants to make a comeback, he'll listen to me. At worst..."
"I'll give him a forgiveness voucher. There are still dozens left anyway. He'll be obedient."
No, there weren't. Only one last one remained.
Celeste Kingston, I won't be your puppet anymore.
I lay stunned on the floor for a long time before returning to my room and retrieving my journal.
Though everyone said the modeling industry wasn't much cleaner than entertainment, I truly loved my career.
Standing on that runway, enveloped by the spotlight, that surge of confidence was where I found my worth.
But now, it was utterly destroyed. Perhaps even fate was telling me it was time to leave, to let go.
Tears streaming, I wrote about the day's events in my journal, ending with "98."
Each time she hurt me, I would record it in my journal, reminding myself not to soften.
But then, Celeste's voice suddenly came from behind me.
"What does 98 mean?"
