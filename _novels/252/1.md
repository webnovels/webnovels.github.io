"Oh, the international supermodel actually agreed to lick it? What a woman Celeste is, she really knows how to handle her men!"
"What if he doesn't lick it, then? Are we really going to let Leo do it? That's Celeste's precious Leo, the one she's always pined for!"
The mocking chatter around me was incessant, and I felt nothing but humiliation amidst it all.
Yet, amidst this sickening display of condescension, Celeste Kingston half-knelt in front of Leo Thorne, carefully applying a bandage to his neck. Then she turned, her eyes cold as she gestured at me.
"Asher Hayes, don't play games. Leo is waiting for you to finish so we can continue the game."
Leo, Leo...
She only cared about Leo, never once asking if I was willing.
She completely forgot I was her husband.
Seeing me frozen, someone abruptly shoved me.
"Why are you just standing there? Go on, lick it! You're not backing out, are you?"
I stumbled, regaining my balance, and looked at Celeste again. Her gaze was already fixed entirely on Leo once more.
"Ninety-six times. This is the ninety-sixth time."
I silently counted, stiffly walking towards Cassandra Vane, the notorious socialite who had cream on her leg.
But just as I stooped down, her hand suddenly clamped onto my chin.
She looked at Leo. "Mr. Thorne, this isn't right. You lost three rounds to me. Just one lick won't do."
"How about the 'Egg Challenge'? If you can convince him to do it, the punishment is null and void."
The 'Egg Challenge'? What in the world was that?!
An unknown dread immediately surged through me. I quickly looked to Celeste.
But the next second, Leo was already looking at Celeste with pleading eyes, clinging to her arm, whimpering playfully.
"Celeste, it's just a dare. Can you get Asher to agree just this once...?"
Seeing Leo's fragile body trembling, Celeste was filled with nothing but tenderness. Her eyes blazed as she looked at me.
"Asher, you're willing to lick cream, so you won't mind taking another dare for Leo, right?"
"Yay! Thank you, Celeste!" Leo jumped up, beaming with triumph.
Watching Celeste gently ruffle Leo's hair, her expression doting and indulgent, I started to laugh. My dignity had been trampled. I was nothing but a toy, to be tormented and played with.
Celeste, how could you be so heartless as to make me perform some twisted act, to be humiliated for him again?
Oh, right, I almost forgot. Leo was her unattainable moon.
She'd pursued him for years with no success. Then, their families had torn them apart, and Leo had left the country overnight.
Now that she finally had what she desired, how could I possibly compete?
Suppressing the bitterness in my heart, I spoke stiffly.
"So, does that count as a forgiveness voucher?"
A forgiveness voucher? Everyone laughed at my strange question, but Celeste suddenly looked at me.
She knew what I was talking about.
After a moment, she nodded.
"It counts!"
I gave a bitter laugh.
"Alright, I agree."
Eight years ago, I had just entered the modeling world when I was noticed by a powerful, ruthless circle of women, who essentially confined me on an island. There, alongside other young men, I became their... 'entertainment.'
I was lucky. Celeste Kingston was the first woman I met there, and she fell for me instantly.
For my sake, she systematically took over their businesses, ensured they ended up behind bars, and rescued me from that life.
Only later did I learn that my features bore an uncanny resemblance to Leo's.
But on the night I was rescued, I asked her how I could repay her kindness.
Her eyes were sincere.
"Marry me."
I gave her a playful squeeze.
"I'm serious."
Her breath hitched as she clung to me, her words a tangled whisper:
"Then... give me ninety-nine forgiveness vouchers."
"Forgiveness vouchers?" I was curious, clinging to her, not understanding.
At that moment, she smiled.
"Silly boy. If—and I mean *if*—if one day, I hurt you ninety-nine times, I'll use these vouchers to make you forgive me ninety-nine times. Once the vouchers are used up, this debt of gratitude will be paid off."
For the next five years, she poured massive resources into my career, turning me into an international supermodel. She cherished me like precious treasure.
Until two months ago, when Leo returned. Everything changed.
This was the 97th time. Just two more. My debt would be repaid.
Seeing Celeste agree, Cassie Vane pulled me into her private VIP room, a dimly lit chamber draped in silk. Boiled eggs were scattered across a low table, and on the floor, two or three men lay in disheveled heaps, a cloying scent of decay and degradation hanging in the air.
A shiver of dread crawled up my spine. My blood ran cold.
So the "eggs" Leo talked about meant... stuffing them into a private place...
Celeste, who had followed us in, suddenly stiffened, her pupils constricting. She turned to Leo.
"Wasn't it about eating eggs?! What is this?"
But Leo ignored her. He simply pushed me forward.
"Cassie, Mr. Hayes used to be a dancer, his flexibility is sure to... impress you."
"Don't you want to try it yourself? Challenge the limits?"
As Leo's words fell, I, already terrified, trembled violently and immediately looked to Celeste for help.
At the very least, I was still her husband. She had loved me once. Though she'd put me through a lot for Leo, she wouldn't really hand me over to a pervert, would she?
But to my shock, the next second, Celeste walked to the table, poured a glass of wine, and pressed it into my hand.
"Why don't you offer Cassie a toast? Get this party started, Asher."
Get the party started? Was she serious?
She... she actually agreed?
In a daze, I saw Leo give me a strange, knowing smile.
"Asher! Didn't you hear Celeste?"
As I watched Leo approach, unsure what to do, he suddenly kicked me in the knee.
My body instantly lost balance, and the wine in my hand splashed across Cassie Vane's face.
Then I fell onto the shattered glass, my arm instantly gushing with several cuts.
My eyes met the twisted, pale face of one of the men on the floor.
Leo's sharp accusation rang in my ears:
"Asher, if you don't want to toast, just say so! There's no need to pretend to be crazy to provoke Cassie. Is that how Celeste's husband acts? You're just trying to embarrass Celeste!"
Cassie's expression froze for a moment, then she reacted, her eyes widening as she looked at me.
"You... you're the rumored husband of Celeste Kingston?"
I was speechless, slumped on the floor, my body and heart aching almost to the point of suffocation.
Cassie reached out to grab my arm, but Celeste immediately caught her wrist.
Celeste's gaze swept over my blood-soaked face. Her eyes suddenly turned dark and chilling as she looked at Cassie, gritting her teeth.
"Get out!"
Cassie was intimidated. She could only swallow her anger and slink away, muttering under her breath as she left.
"Celeste Kingston! You're crazy! If I'd known you were this lunatic's husband, I wouldn't have touched him!"
As Cassie disappeared, I tried to get up, but a large hand clamped onto my arm again.
"Asher, you're happy you didn't have to take the punishment, aren't you? Did those two years on the island teach you nothing about obedience?"
"All you had to do was offer a toast, and this whole thing would've been over. Why did you have to play crazy? You knew perfectly well that by asking you to toast, I wanted to end this! Are you blind?"
As I stared at an enraged Celeste, my bloodshot eyes were my only answer.
This time, I finally didn't hold back. I retorted:
"Celeste Kingston! I'm your husband! If you had just stated my identity, this whole thing could have been resolved just as easily!"
My words were clear. It was *her*. It was her vanity, her desire to protect Leo at that moment, that made her keep my identity secret.
My accusation hit a nerve. Celeste looked momentarily flustered.
Seeing this, Leo tried to interject on her behalf.
But Celeste, unusually, frowned and cut him off.
"Enough! Shut up, go wait for me in the car."
Once his footsteps faded, she sighed.
"I'm sorry, but I still need to explain. I genuinely didn't know what the 'Egg Challenge' meant. If I had, I never would have agreed in the first place."
"As for Leo, I hope you can understand. After all, he just returned to the country and saw that I was married..."
Celeste's words trailed off, but I could still guess the rest.
She wanted to say that Leo was upset about her marriage and deliberately made things difficult for me, so I should forgive him.
Our eyes met. Celeste seemed to grasp the mockery in my gaze, and she sighed again.
"Alright, I see you're hurt. I'll have the driver take you to the hospital. Leo's not doing well, I need to check on him. We can discuss this more when I get back."
Without waiting for my reply, she added, "Even though you didn't complete the task, I'll allow you to count it as a forgiveness voucher."
With that, she turned and left. Watching her walk away, I touched my still bleeding forehead and laughed out loud.
But I didn't care anymore.
Two more times. Once the debt of gratitude was paid, I would leave.
From then on, I wouldn't suffer her indignities anymore.
