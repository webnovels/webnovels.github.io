At an extravagant celebration party, my husband Caleb Winters once again ordered me to play the role of a maid. He pushed me in front of the new model his company had just signed, introducing me flippantly, "This is the dog I keep at home. If it weren't for my mother's kindness years ago, she'd have starved to death on the streets."

He commanded me to bow and scrape, to massage the model's shoulders, to serve her with all my skills. Everyone laughed, waiting to see how I would continue to show my gratitude. Instead, I inappropriately brought up divorce.

Caleb acted as if he'd heard the most ridiculous joke. He grabbed my neck, snarling viciously, "Aria Sinclair, you dare mention divorce? Have you forgotten who's keeping your sick mother and paralyzed brother alive?"

"If you keep acting up, I'll cut off all your brother's medical expenses right now!"

Everyone bet that I would immediately cry and beg for forgiveness, saying I'd never let go of this golden opportunity I'd managed to grasp.

But they didn't hear his usually silent uncle, Lucas Winters, the true power holder of the Winters family, whisper behind me:

"Divorce him. I'll take care of you."
