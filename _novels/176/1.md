I never imagined that Asher, whom I loved for four years, saw me merely as a means to an end.

Even our child was just a tool to save Adeline.

I covered my mouth tightly, stifling my sobs.

It wasn't until I returned to my room that tears began to flow uncontrollably.

Half a year ago, I was brought back to Cora's family.

On the sofa sat my dad and the delicate, pale Cora.

My dad gazed at Cora with affection, treating me like a stranger.

"I don't care about blood ties. Though Cora is a fake heiress, she's still my daughter whom I've raised for 18 years. You two need to get along."

Despite feeling unsettled, I nodded.

I had spent the first 18 years in an orphanage, longing desperately for family love.

But then he asked me to donate bone marrow to Cora!

"She's your sister. It's only right for a sister to yield to her sibling."

"If you can't donate even this bit of bone marrow, you're unworthy of being part of Cora's family."

In an instant, my last shred of hope was completely shattered.

As they were about to force me with bodyguards,

I grabbed a fruit knife and held it to my neck.

"I'd rather die than give away my bone marrow!"

Cora's family didn't know what to do with me.

At this moment, my boyfriend Asher appeared like a god, driving away those bodyguards.

He reprimanded my dad and took me away from Cora's family.

"Don't worry, I'll give you a home and all my love."

I believed his promise, and after our quick marriage, my heart was filled with him.

Asher clung to me every day, saying he wanted a love child with me.

I said I didn't want kids so soon.

But he secretly poked holes in the condoms behind my back.

Even the nutritious meals he made for me were actually fertility porridge...

Asher had planned it all along, wanting me to get pregnant to save Adeline.

Coming back to reality, I looked at the crumpled pregnancy test sheet in my hand, feeling a wave of disgust.

I threw it under the bed and scheduled an appointment for an abortion.

Just as I confirmed the time, Asher walked in.

Seeing my tear-streaked face, he looked tense:

"Who upset my wife? I'm here, don't cry."

In the past, I would have been touched, thinking he was my support.

But now, knowing the truth, I found him hypocritical and disgusting.

Seeing my silence, Asher frowned slightly,

"What happened? Didn't you just message me saying you had something to tell me?"

I made up an excuse,

"I won a prize. The company is rewarding me with a three-day vacation."

A hint of disappointment flashed in Asher's eyes.

He thought it was the good news of my pregnancy and was about to say something.

But then his phone rang again.

I saw it was a message from Adeline, and my heart ached.

But Asher's expression softened instantly, focusing on Adeline's message.

I watched coldly, realizing how blind I'd been.

I never noticed how obvious they were.

After replying to the message, Asher came over and pinched my face like usual.

"Wife, I don't want to be apart from you. Adeline also said she wants to go out for some relaxation. How about the three of us go together?"

I frowned and refused, "No way, you know we don't get along."

Asher pouted, "We're family after all. You've been distant from them for so long, it's not good for our future. Why not take this chance to ease things?"

"That's settled, any more fuss and you're just being unreasonable."

With that, he turned and left.

I sighed, feeling only irritation.

To avoid them noticing anything, I messaged the doctor to postpone the abortion by three days.

While packing that night, I found Asher's diary.

He never let me open it, and I obediently complied.

But this time, I opened it impulsively.

Every page recorded his deep love for Adeline.

"Tomorrow I'm marrying Cora. I spent the whole night in our bridal chamber holding Adeline. We love each other but can't be together. I hate myself."

"Adeline's condition is worsening. I can only desperately be intimate with Cora to get her pregnant. I wish the person beneath me was Adeline."
