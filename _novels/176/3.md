Asher pretended not to hear and quietly buckled Adeline's seatbelt.

After seeing this, my last bit of affection for him vanished.

I closed my eyes and lay back to rest.

But due to emotional turmoil, I had morning sickness.

Unable to hold back, I threw up in the car, making Adeline scream in anger.

"You're just doing this because I'm in the front seat, trying to disgust me, right?"

"Sister, if you're so petty, I won't go on this trip."

As she spoke, she was about to get out, and Asher hurriedly kicked me out instead.

He didn't bother to hide anymore, his face dark:

"Adeline's health isn't good. Why upset her? What's your motive?"

"We came out to have fun, can't you stop being so petty and ruining everyone's mood?"

He then told me to find my own way to the airport.

But he left me on the highway, where no cars dared to stop.

I had to stumble to the airport on my own.

In the end, my feet were blistered, and the back of my high heels was covered in blood.

Asher noticed and showed a hint of reluctance.

He softened his tone,

"I got too emotional on the road earlier, I'm sorry, wife, let me carry you."

But I directly refused.

I didn't want any physical contact with him anymore.

Seeing my cold attitude, Asher tried to coax me.

Adeline, beside us, was burning with jealousy.

Seeing the brooch on my clothes, she eagerly mocked:

"Isn't this the bonus from buying high heels yesterday? Sister, you really like it."

"Asher, this brooch suits my sister perfectly, you have a great eye."

Asher noticed, and a fleeting reluctance showed in his eyes.

He softened his tone,

"I got too emotional on the road earlier, sorry, my dear. Let me carry you."

But I refused outright.

I didn't want any physical contact with him now.

Seeing my cold demeanor, Asher patiently tried to placate me.

Adeline, standing nearby, was burning with jealousy.

Noticing the brooch on my clothes, she couldn't wait to mock,

"Isn't that the free gift from the high heels I bought yesterday? Sister, you must really like it."

"Asher, this brooch really suits my sister, you have a good eye."

The atmosphere suddenly grew tense.

Asher stammered, trying to explain, but I tossed the brooch into the trash.

It was the first time I had openly disregarded Asher's feelings.

He got a bit angry too, "Even if it's a free gift, it was a token of my affection, and you just threw it away!"

"Adeline is your sister, and I'm her brother-in-law! What's wrong with buying her something?"

"Don't forget, she's the heiress raised in Cora's family. Do you have the right to compete with her?"

Could Asher really remember he's Adeline's brother-in-law?

I felt only irony in my heart, yanking his collar,

"Alright, then explain to me, what are these?"

Asher's face turned red, "These are just mosquito bites from yesterday, my dear, don't misunderstand."

"It's my fault for not making you feel secure. It won't happen again."

Adeline stood by, looking at me with mockery in her eyes, full of provocation.

I only felt exhausted, not saying another word.

When we reached our destination, Adeline insisted on sharing a room with us.

"I'm scared to stay alone, and besides, staying together means you can take better care of me."

"Sister, you're not jealous of even this, are you?"

I was furious, wanting to book a separate room for myself.

But Asher stopped me, "Are you trying to make a joke of us? Besides, Adeline has a point. Just accommodate her a bit more."

Afraid I'd insist on two rooms, Asher grabbed my phone.

Helplessly, I had to share a big bed with them.
