The news about my high-powered lawyer wife, Sierra, throwing me a huge birthday gala was the hot topic of Crestwood. Everyone was talking about it.

But the night before, a text message popped up on her phone: “Five years, and I’ve been waiting for you.”

Sierra shoved me away, guilt flooding her face. She claimed the firm had an urgent, high-profile case, and the managing partner had specifically requested her.

“Rhys, I am so sorry. The MP just called. I have to fly out tonight. I can’t be here for your birthday tomorrow.”

Watching her leave without a second glance, I immediately activated the location-sharing app on my phone.

I watched the tiny red dot move across the screen. I’d personally just taken over as the firm's Managing Partner—I’d approved her vacation time myself. Why would I assign her an emergency case?

I had to see who she was rushing to meet at midnight.

1

Sierra’s car location pinged the grand ballroom at the Crestwood Hotel.

I sped over.

From a distance, I could hear the pop of countless confetti cannons.

As I walked closer, streamers drifted down, blurring the faces in the crowd. Two servers wheeled out a cake taller than a man, pushing it toward the head table.

“Happy Birthday, darling! And happy fifth wedding anniversary!”

My heart slammed against my ribs. That was Sierra’s voice!

And she was calling the man next to her darling!

Fifth wedding anniversary? But… wasn’t that with me?

The confetti settled, and the moment I saw the man’s face, my breath hitched.

Finn Donnelly!

How could the son of my family’s former housekeeper be here?

The congratulations and fawning started immediately.

“I heard Mrs. Albright’s incredibly spoiled husband is none other than Mr. Blackwood, the eldest son of the Crestwood Blackwoods. Seeing him tonight, Mr. Blackwood is every bit as impressive as they say!”

“It’s true. Mr. Blackwood and Mrs. Albright—the perfect childhood sweethearts. They are stunning together!”

Since when did Finn Donnelly become the eldest son of my Blackwood family?

I don’t have a brother!

They were childhood acquaintances, sure. Finn’s mother had been the Blackwoods’ housekeeper, actually the Albrights’ housekeeper first. But after Sierra—then Yunxi—developed an infatuation with him, her parents fired his mother. My family, out of misguided kindness, took them in.

I was soft-hearted enough to give Finn a job at the law firm. It was mostly menial office work, but I paid him a decent salary.

Yet, I'd been away from Crestwood for just two weeks, and Finn had somehow transformed into the Blackwood Heir and Sierra’s husband!

“And thanks to Mr. Blackwood’s connections, Albright & Associates is reeling in multi-million dollar deals!”

“What a lucky woman, Mrs. Albright!”

They shared a look of pure, saccharine happiness—the heroes and heroine of some corny romance novel, sweet enough to induce a diabetic coma.

Just then, Finn gripped Sierra’s hand, his face flushed.

“Sierra and I grew up together. We’ve been in love for twenty years!”

“Sierra was just worried the media buzz would interfere with my private life, so we’ve kept our marriage quiet until now.”

Sierra smiled, offering a silent confirmation.

The guests nodded, murmuring, "Ah, that makes sense."

I laughed—a sharp, ugly sound.

No wonder Sierra always kept me out of the spotlight. No wonder she hid our relationship even within the firm.

It was all to give Finn the time to scrub his "housekeeper’s son" label and take my place!

To solidify his identity as the Blackwood heir, he even stole my birthday!

If she loved him so much, I’d grant this pathetic couple their wish. I'd file for divorce immediately.

I walked closer, step by agonizing step. Sierra was nestled against Finn’s chest, chatting confidently.

“Besides wanting to avoid harassment for Finn, the Blackwood family traditions don't encourage the heir to seek public attention.”

“I wasn’t aware the Blackwood family had that rule!”

“Sierra Albright, when did you find time to acquire a second husband behind my back?”

My voice boomed, slicing through the noisy room. The entire hall went silent.

Sierra instantly pulled away from Finn, a guilty flicker crossing her eyes. Her face went from pale to blazing red.

I strode forward, snatched the champagne flute from her hand, and flung the wine straight into her face.

“What’s wrong? Did your 'urgent business trip' end with you in another man’s arms?”

“Rhys Blackwood, what the hell is wrong with you?”

Sierra wiped the wine off her face, trembling with rage.

She was furious, yes, but the shifty look in her eyes betrayed her immense guilt.

Before I could press her, the Chief Counsel from the rival firm, Crestwood Legal, jumped in, whipping up the crowd’s anger.

“Security! What kind of lunatic did you let in here?”

“This is a top-tier legal networking event. Who do you think you are, impersonating Mrs. Albright’s husband and defaming her?”

“This is slander and intentional damage to a professional’s reputation! Apologize now!”

The young lawyers at Albright & Associates quickly chimed in.

“You came to the wrong place to throw a tantrum! We deal in law, and we have plenty of legal methods to bury you in lawsuits!”

“Mrs. Albright is kind enough not to press charges, but we’re here to uphold justice!”

I chuckled, looking at Sierra.

“You want to take me to court, do you?”

“Setting aside everything else, Mrs. Albright, cohabiting under the pretense of a marriage while being legally wed, that’s called bigamy, isn’t it? You, an expert, wouldn’t be unaware, would you?”

“You just announced your ‘fifth wedding anniversary.’ That alone could land you two years in the federal penitentiary, sweetheart.”

Finn’s eyes welled up instantly. He tugged at my wife’s arm, whining.

“Rhys, please, don’t make trouble for Sierra. It’s all my fault…”

Seeing Finn’s pitiful display, Sierra immediately flared up, shooting me a cold warning.

“Rhys Blackwood, what is this nonsense about bigamy? Get out of here and go home!”

That command—Go home—sent a wave of curiosity through the guests. They began re-examining me with a probing gaze.

I scoffed.

“Afraid your fake husband can’t handle the truth?”

“Rhys! I know your mother worked for Sierra’s family and that you grew up around her, but this is too much!” Finn’s voice was pitched high, his indignation ringing false.

“I know you like Sierra, but we’re having a baby! Please, stop trying to destroy my family!”

“I took pity on you and gave you a job at the firm, and this is how you repay my kindness?”

I was stunned. Were these not my lines?

Finn Donnelly had no shame!

Sierra, sensing the doubt in the crowd's eyes, quickly provided a perfectly reasonable explanation.

“I’ve always kept Rhys at arm’s length. I never imagined he’d be so shameless as to make a scene like this. I apologize for this embarrassment.”

“Rhys Blackwood, if you continue, don’t blame me when I fire you and have you escorted off Albright property!”

Only then did the guests drop their guard, whispering amongst themselves.

“Oh, he was the housekeeper’s kid! That explains why she told him to ‘go home.’”

“He looks presentable, but he’s just a desperate gold-digger trying to climb the social ladder! Spreading rumors about Mrs. Albright committing bigamy—he’s insane.”

“Men like that will do anything to claw their way to the top. They’d sell their soul, even disown their own parents.”

I watched Finn, a smug grin plastered on his face, which started to stiffen under the guests’ insults. He was certainly interesting to keep smiling while being publicly shamed.

I nodded, rolling my eyes at Finn.

“You’re right. Some men will disown their own mother just to leech off someone else’s success.”

“Isn’t that right, Finn Donnelly?”

“How did you beg me when the Albrights kicked you out after you tried to hook up with Sierra? You came crawling to me for a place to stay and a job. Is this how you repay me? By marrying my wife and getting her pregnant?”

Finn’s face was beet red.

Before I could expose more of his past, someone grabbed me from behind and shoved me.

I fell, hitting my head on a table corner. A warm, sticky liquid trickled down my temple, and my vision blurred from the pain.

When I blinked, a heavily made-up, brassy woman stood over me, slamming a piece of the cake onto my face.

“Puh! What rubbish! Finn is obviously a high-society gentleman! You, with your poor, common background, how dare you lust after Mrs. Albright?”

Finn smirked, a look of triumph in his eyes.

“Exactly! I’m a Harvard Law J.D. who just closed three multi-million dollar deals. If a disgruntled former assistant like you could successfully impersonate me, my degree would be worthless.”

Harvard Law J.D. He was stealing my entire professional life!

“That’s right! The support staff should stick to their support tasks. Don’t try to seduce the boss.”

“Finn, you can’t keep a crazy man like this around. Today he’s impersonating you, who knows what he’ll do tomorrow!”

“If he’s so desperate for women, he should quit the firm and go sell himself on the street.”

I looked at Sierra. Her face was cold, impassive, and she idly swirled the wine in her glass.

“Sierra Albright, do you remember what you said when you were pursuing me? You said you’d love me forever.”

“Now you just watch them humiliate me?”

Sierra’s expression shifted, hardening into something cold and utterly foreign.

“If you hadn’t insisted on making this scene, we wouldn’t be in this situation now.”

Finn seized the opportunity.

“Sierra told me you were constantly bothering and harassing her. She only tolerated you because your mother worked for her family for so many years.”

“But this slander—accusing her of bigamy—is crossing a line!”

“I’m announcing this now: Rhys Blackwood is terminated. Albright & Associates will not harbor an ungrateful snake!”

Ungrateful snake?

I stared at Sierra.

“Are you sure Finn is the one who closed those accounts?”

“Who opened the client pipeline that built Albright & Associates? Who stayed up all night drafting the briefs? Who landed those ten seven-figure deals that solidified this firm’s reputation?”

“Sierra, do you dare tell everyone the truth?”

A flicker of fear and hesitation crossed her face.

Then, Finn interjected smoothly.

“To give you some experience, we did let you handle the initial contacts. But every single one of those cases was a complete mess. Sierra and I had to step in and save them in the end.”

Sierra seemed to genuinely believe this fabricated narrative. Her expression turned icy.

“Rhys Blackwood, I indulged you too much. Now you’re trying to steal Finn’s credit!”

Hearing Sierra's words, the contempt in the crowd’s eyes intensified.

“A mere admin who poured coffee and printed documents is trying to steal credit from Mr. Blackwood? He thinks a bug can fly to the heavens!”

Sierra took Finn’s hand.

“If you resign immediately and hand over the contact information for Mr. Theodore Blackwood—the founder of Blackwood Group—we won't press charges for your slander.”

My blood ran cold. My wife of five years was using my own birthday party to fleece me?

They were after the nearly two million dollars in retainer fees from the three massive Blackwood Group cases I’d brought in!

She orchestrated this entire farce to please her mistress and steal my identity!

I shook my head, laughing softly. Sierra had made a critical mistake.

She’d forgotten that the "Blackwood Group" they were talking about... was my family. And I—Rhys Blackwood—was the eldest son.

It was time for the real Blackwood heir to clean house.

I smiled.

“You’ll have the number right away.”

“But do you two genuinely believe a pair of fakes like you could ever close a deal with the Patriarch of the Blackwood Group?”

“Sierra, you can burn the bridge behind you, but ungrateful snakes never end well.”

“I’m sending the divorce papers to your personal email in the morning.”

“Rhys Blackwood, have you gone completely insane? You’re addicted to playing the role of Mrs. Albright’s husband and the Blackwood Heir?”

“What divorce? Finn has always been my husband!”

Sierra clenched her jaw, trembling. She was trapped in the lie and had no choice but to double down.

I folded my arms, watching the unfolding train wreck.

A few Albright & Associates people were starting to waver, looking at me with new respect.

Their whispers were loud enough to hear in the unnatural silence.

“Rhys is a Blackwood, too. Maybe Finn is the real interloper.”

“I hear the real Blackwood Heir is incredibly low-key. Finn, with all the logos, is a little too much, isn’t he?”

Finn’s smile vanished, replaced by a furious glare.

“Rhys Blackwood, I have a Harvard Law J.D.! You barely finished high school! How dare you make these ridiculous claims!?”

“I’ll call Mr. Blackwood right now. Let me show you how a professional closes a multi-million dollar deal!”

Seeing his renewed confidence, the hangers-on paused, waiting to see who was telling the truth.

“Rhys Blackwood, you’re so manipulative! You know the Patriarch rarely takes unscheduled calls, and you’re goading Finn into calling him in front of everyone!”

“No wonder we were almost fooled. What a dirty trick!”

“Since you claim you closed those multi-million dollar deals, show us the proof.”

“Tell me, which one of those case files has your name listed as the client attorney?”

My heart sank.

That’s why.

That's why Sierra always coaxed me into putting the cases under her name, claiming it was to build the firm’s prestige.

It was all for this moment. To steal my entire life and hand it to Finn Donnelly! My Blackwood heir status, my marriage, my professional achievements—everything I built, she stole.

I laughed a self-deprecating laugh. How blind could I have been to love this trash for five years?

Seeing me speechless, the entire room of legal sycophants erupted.

“He talked a big game, but he has no evidence! What a fraud! Get him out of here!”

“Call security! Get this lying dog out! He’s disgusting!”

A group of four middle-aged women exchanged salacious glances and started toward me.

“No need for security. We’ll drag him out and teach him a lesson. He’ll learn to keep his mouth shut.”

The naked lust in their eyes made my skin crawl.

Sierra frowned slightly, showing a brief moment of hesitation.

“We’re just teaching him a lesson so he remembers it. We’re all Crestwood professionals. Nobody will go too far.”

Hearing that, Sierra seemed reassured, turning away from me.

A portly woman with a heavy jaw grabbed my wrist, her eyes lingering on my chest.

I yelled, using all my strength.

“Let go of me!”

“I am Rhys Blackwood, grandson of Theodore Blackwood! Touch me again, and you’ll regret it for the rest of your life!”

Everyone froze for a split second, then burst into uncontrollable laughter.

“I’m dying! The little assistant is getting carried away with his role-playing!”

“I have to admit, when he yells, he does have a bit of the high-and-mighty heir attitude!”

The woman yanked me toward the exit. Two other older women took advantage of the situation, reaching out to grope me.

I was held fast by four or five strong women.

“Fine, fine, you can be the billionaire’s grandson. The ladies will have a little fun with you.”

I looked at Sierra, yelling.

“Sierra Albright!”

“Stop them now! My family helped build the Albright name. We can erase it overnight!”

Sierra finally looked back at me, her eyes completely devoid of emotion.

She offered a flat, distant, “Oh.”

“Rhys Blackwood, blame your bad luck. You were born a servant’s son. Stop dreaming of being my husband and replacing Finn.”

Encouraged by her words, the women grew bolder. One of them slipped her hand down my collar, groping me freely.

“Mr. Theodore Blackwood, the Patriarch of the Blackwood Group, has arrived!”
