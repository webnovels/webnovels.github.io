“Besides, as an illegitimate son, if I marry him, the Vance family will be his foundation for establishing himself in the Hayes family. He’ll certainly treat me well.”

Now, Tiffany was the talk of the town, everyone flattering and trying to curry favor with her. Countless people rushed to meet and connect with her.

After all, the Hayes and Peterson families were a powerful union. If anyone could get a chance to collaborate, they would surely rise to the next level in their respective industries.

I didn’t have time to bother with such things. I was focused on completing the task my mother had given me abroad.

One day, Mr. Sterling was celebrating his birthday. Tiffany specifically sent me an invitation and called me several times, so I had no choice but to go.

The moment I stepped through the Hayes family’s front door, all eyes fell on me.

I showed no embarrassment, smiling as I handed my gift to the Hayes butler.

“Why is Scarlett here? Didn’t the engagement switch?”
“You don’t know? Mr. Hayes Jr. insisted on switching fiancées, so she, in a fit of pique, chose the Hayes family’s illegitimate son to marry.”
“To marry an illegitimate son just to get into the Hayes family… Miss Vance really is something else.”

Just as everyone was chattering, Tiffany appeared, ostentatiously holding Derek’s arm.

Unlike her usual low-key, gentle attire, she was wearing a haute couture gown today, adorned with several sets of intricate and luxurious jewelry, making her look gaudy and somewhat tacky.

Seeing me there, she came over intimately, wanting to link arms with me.

“Sister, it’s wonderful that both of us sisters can marry into the Hayes family! As a sisterly favor, I’ll make sure Bro-Derek promotes your husband more.”

I almost laughed at Tiffany. Even now, she still believed all I cared about was marrying into the Hayes family.

Derek thought so too. In his eyes, I was desperate to marry into the Hayes family, using any means necessary. He looked at me as if I were something dirty.

Too lazy to bother with the two of them, I turned to leave, but then I noticed the pair of exquisitely crafted heirloom bracelets on Tiffany’s wrist.

These were the Hayes family’s heirloom bracelets, always kept by Mr. Sterling. I hadn’t expected them to be on Tiffany’s wrist, and with at least three or four other bracelets on her arm, I hadn’t recognized them at first glance.

The Hayes family heir hadn’t even been confirmed yet. How did those bracelets end up on Tiffany?

I pointed at the bracelets on Tiffany’s wrist, my gaze filled with a hint of inquiry.

“Where did those bracelets come from?”

Derek looked momentarily guilty, while Tiffany caressed the bracelets on her wrist, a hint of grievance on her face.

“Sister, these bracelets were meant for you before, but now I’m the one marrying Bro-Derek, so of course, they belong to me.”

Derek nodded, his expression righteous. In his mind, he was the undisputed heir, so there was no harm in letting his beloved wear the bracelets beforehand.

“These are my Hayes family’s heirloom bracelets. I can let anyone I want wear them. What does it have to do with you?”

He then scanned me up and down, taking a step back with a disgusted look.

“Don’t you dare try to use this method to cling to me. I won’t ever like you. My heart only belongs to Tiffany.”

Derek’s voice wasn’t quiet, and several gazes around us landed on me.

“Scarlett usually seems so proud. I can’t believe she’s trying to steal her own sister’s fiancé just to marry into the Hayes family.”
“They’re clearly in love. Why is she still trying to cling on?”

Tiffany blushed, her face coyly hitting Derek on the arm.

“Don’t be so mean to Sister. We’ll be family when she marries in. You’ll have to help them out then.”

Derek glanced at me, then dotingly pinched Tiffany’s cheek.

“Fine, for Tiffany’s sake, I won’t dwell on it. But if you have any improper thoughts about me, don’t blame me for being ruthless.”

The two of them were still lost in their tender moment when a voice suddenly chimed in from behind them.

“Why would my wife have improper thoughts about you?

“Derek, that’s incredibly rude, talking about your future sister-in-law like that.”
