Once Mr. Sterling spoke, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.

This alliance had invited many business magnates to witness the event, and everyone was eager to see how it would unfold.

Amidst the whispers of the crowd, Derek, holding Tiffany’s hand, faced the guests who had come to celebrate and announced,

“Thank you all for attending my and Miss Peterson’s engagement ceremony today.”

The guests’ faces were a mix of expressions. No one had expected the Hayes and Peterson families to actually swap fiancées on the spot.

My father was equally stunned, his face instantly darkening. My own expression wasn't much better, but I forced myself to stand tall, holding my head high amidst the murmurs, and raised my glass to offer a generous gift.

“Mr. Hayes Jr. actually swapped fiancées on the spot? He gave Scarlett no face at all!”
“Didn’t Mr. Sterling insist on Scarlett becoming his granddaughter-in-law? How did he agree to the change?”
“Changing fiancées on the day of the engagement party—that’s truly embarrassing. Who knows what she did to make Mr. Hayes Jr. do something like that?”

The guests’ whispers weren’t quiet. My father glared at Tiffany, showing Derek no deference either.

“How much gossip will you cause your sister by doing this?”
“And you, you’re not a child anymore. Acting without thinking of the consequences—are you trying to make a fool of me?”

Tiffany, scolded by my father, timidly tried to take off the ring to give it to me.

Mr. Sterling waved his hand, stopping her. He touched my head apologetically, his voice deep.

“Scarlett, don’t worry. Grandpa Sterling will see to it. If you’re willing, the Hayes family has several other excellent young men.”

Mr. and Mrs. Hayes heard Mr. Sterling’s words and simply assumed he was comforting me, so they didn't pay much attention.

To their shock, I pointed to Julian Hayes, Mr. Hayes’s illegitimate son, who was watching the drama unfold from a corner.

“Actually, I’ve always liked Julian. I hope Grandpa can grant us his blessing.”

Everyone’s gazes fell on Julian, flickering between him and me.

Julian was Mr. Hayes Sr.’s illegitimate son. After Mr. Hayes Sr.’s passing, Julian wasn’t well-regarded in the family and had a difficult life.

But since he was still a Hayes, Mr. Sterling didn’t want others saying the Hayes family mistreated its own blood. So he had taken Julian in and raised him personally.

My father stared at me in shock, then whispered, trying to persuade me.

“Scarlett, Dad knows you’re upset, but he’s an illegitimate son. The Hayes family doesn’t value him.”

I casually swirled my glass, raising it to Julian in a silent toast.

“He didn’t choose to be an illegitimate son. I think he’s quite good. I’m willing to give it a try with him.”

Julian’s eyes met mine, his demeanor relaxed.

“Since Miss Vance likes me, then let’s give it a try.”

The guests’ gazes on me became even more meaningful.

News of the Hayes family changing fiancées on the spot spread like wildfire in our social circle. As soon as the party ended, I received a message from my mother.

In a private room, my mother held me close, her eyes glaring at my father.

“Mr. Peterson, how dare you let my daughter suffer such humiliation? Are you trying to get yourself disowned?”

I squeezed my mother’s hand, redirecting the conversation to the main issue.

“Grandpa Sterling found me a new fiancé. His name is Julian Hayes, and I actually quite like him.”

My father wiped the sweat from his forehead and sighed again.

“He’s just an illegitimate son, a nobody in the Hayes family. Why would you choose him?”

I looked at my parents’ confused expressions and slowly began to explain.

“Grandpa Sterling and my grandfather made this arrangement, so I definitely have to marry into the Hayes family.”

“Even though Julian is an illegitimate son, he’s the most capable among the younger Hayes generation. From a business perspective, he’s the most suitable partner.”
