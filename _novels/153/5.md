Lily blinked her eyes, looking at me coyly.

"Sister, I didn't mean for this to happen, but I really do love Zachary."

"Since you've found another man, why don't you let him go to me? You drink and party every day, meeting far more men than I do, but I only have Zachary."

"I can't live without him."

Zachary looked at her with extreme tenderness.

"Lily, you don't need to beg her. I make my own decisions about who I marry."

I laughed mirthlessly: "Fine, Zachary. If you're so tough, why don't you pay back all the money I've spent on you first?"

His small company, his designer clothes, his clients - all were given by me.

Zachary had probably forgotten that he owed his success entirely to me.

So I decided to remind him.

Zachary stiffened at my revelation.

"You really never cared about me. All you see is money."

"When Lily and I have our child, I'll pay you back double!"

I said sarcastically: "Haha, even if you married and had a child on the same day as me, with your abilities, you couldn't compete with me."

"I've been too lenient with you before, spoiling you to the point where you don't know your place?"

"Don't forget, I am the daughter of the Reed family! Even if you marry Lily, you're still just penniless nobodies. What qualifies you to become directors of the company?"

With each sentence I spoke, the three men's faces grew paler.

"And you!"

Lily opened her mouth, but I cut her off harshly.

"You have no ability of your own, so you want to hand the company over to others, and to these three ungrateful men at that."

"They can benefit from me while bullying me today. Tomorrow, they'll cheat on you behind your back and use Reed family money to keep mistresses."

"Isn't that exactly what you and your mother did? Spending my father's money outside."

Lily bit her lip hard, her eyes exploding with intense hatred.

Zachary couldn't bear to see Lily upset and pointed at my nose, cursing: "Aria, do you think everyone is like you, only caring about money? What Lily and I have is true love."

"As for you..."

He pointed at my secretary, who had hurried over, his tone mocking: "You couldn't buy our true feelings with money, so you went to keep a dirty man. Who knows, maybe he doesn't even want you!"

The secretary leaned close to my ear and said: "Boss! That man... he, he..."

"He's backing out?"

My expression darkened.

Zachary grinned triumphantly: "What did I say, Aria? A vain, money-grubbing woman like you, even if you pay to keep someone, no one would want you!"

"Even a dirty man won't marry you. Let's see how smug you are now."

The secretary looked at the four smug faces, then at my grim expression.

"He said he wants to..."

A man's magnetic voice came from the doorway.

"I want to come and propose in person."
