The man's hand paused as he was handing me coffee, looking at me strangely, confusion spreading across his handsome face.

My father was furious on the other end of the phone.

"Ridiculous! You've chosen another man at random!"

"You've been cultivating three suitors for years, and none of them satisfy you?"

"And besides, is the Reed family open to just anyone?!"

I flipped through the man's profile, scanning it quickly before nodding with satisfaction.

Turning to address my enraged father, I said, "Don't worry, Dad. I've been evaluating those three for years, and I've just realized they're all style over substance."

"Since I'm the one having the child, I'll definitely be thorough in my vetting process. The father of my child won't be some loser, so you don't need to worry about that."

"Just remember your promise: whoever has a child first inherits Reed Enterprises. Have the stock transfer agreement and inheritance documents ready."

Faced with my directness, my father fell silent, leaving me with only one final comment: "Just make sure that man doesn't embarrass our family."

He knew he had wronged me.

Originally, I was the only daughter of the Reed family, the destined heir to Reed Enterprises.

But on my 18th birthday, my half-sister stumbled through our front door, crying, "Dad, Mom's dead. You're the only family I have left."

My mother had passed away when I was young, and Dad had never remarried.

I thought he was devoted to her memory, but it turned out he had a mistress and a half-sister only two years younger than me.

Dad said he kept it from me to avoid hurting me, but Lily Snow moved into our home in tears on my birthday, making me the laughingstock of the entire city.

To make it up to me, Dad immediately wanted to hand the company over to me.

But Lily cried, her face red with tears.

"Dad, I don't care about fighting for the inheritance, but Mom put her heart and soul into this company too!"

"If Mom hadn't given up her career to take care of the family, how could you have devoted yourself entirely to the company? Now you want to hand over the company that Mom poured her heart into to an outsider? Are you trying to destroy this family?"

"This is all that's left of Mom in this world. I'm begging you..."

Dad was torn, until a shareholder spoke up:

"Mr. Reed only has two daughters. Giving it to either one means giving it to an outsider, right?"

"Instead of this, why not have your daughters find future heirs? Whoever has a child first can inherit the company."

Dad agreed wholeheartedly and made the decision on the spot.

That's what was said, but everyone knew the company would most likely go to me, Aria Reed.

I was older, had a wider social circle, and my status in our circles was far above Lily's. Finding an excellent partner and having a child would be a piece of cake for me.

Although Dad felt sorry for Lily, he knew deep down she wasn't qualified to be the heir. He just couldn't bring himself to explicitly tell her to give up her inheritance rights due to his guilty conscience and to save face.

But since someone had offered a way out, he took it, though in his heart, he had already decided I would be his heir.

Marriage and childbirth were just formalities to convince others and Lily.
