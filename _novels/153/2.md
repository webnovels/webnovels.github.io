I worked efficiently.

As soon as I hung up the phone, I quickly prepared a document and handed it to the male model.

The model's name was Caleb Chase.

He stopped my assistant from scolding me and silently signed the prenuptial agreement, even more compliant than I had imagined.

My secretary was stunned, whispering in my ear, "Miss Reed, I think he's specifically after you. Don't let him trick you out of your heart, body, and money."

I looked around the room, filled with handsome men and beautiful women, but the man before me was undoubtedly the most eye-catching of them all.

I had originally come to inspect the newest entertainment division of our branch company, but I never expected to gain a potential heir in the process.

I shrugged, "What can he trick me out of? Money? I have plenty, and once I inherit Reed Enterprises, I won't worry about supporting an idle husband."

"If he can provide quality genes, it's a win-win deal for me."

I briefly skimmed through Caleb's profile.

As for Zachary and the others, since they were unwilling to marry me, there was no need for them to stay with the Reed family anymore.

"Take that man for a full medical checkup and bring the results to the Reed house to see me."

Having resolved one issue, I left the company in a good mood, only to unexpectedly bump into a fragile figure.

Lily covered her mouth, as if she had discovered some great secret.

"Sister, I didn't mean to eavesdrop. I had no idea that even with three wonderful boyfriends, you still weren't satisfied and wanted to fool around with other men..."

Fearing she would start spreading rumors, I instinctively reached out to grab her.

She recoiled as if I were some kind of monster, stumbling backward into Zachary's arms, who had been right behind her.

Zachary held Lily and demanded, "Aria, what have you done now? Look how scared Lily is!"

Felix and Xavier came running up behind them, immediately starting to berate me without knowing the full story.

"Aria, don't go too far! Lily is part of the Reed family too. Why do you bully her the moment she comes to the company?"

Lily tugged at the sleeves of all three men, pouting, "Zachary, guys, don't blame my sister. It's my fault for making her angry."

"I didn't know she was flirting with a male model. I didn't mean to interrupt her..."

"Maybe it's because you guys haven't been paying much attention to her lately, so she's feeling lonely and has set her sights on another man..."

She directly portrayed me as a fickle woman.

But over these years, I had never claimed to be any of their girlfriends.

Firstly, out of respect for them, I didn't want their reputations tarnished as men simultaneously kept by me.

Secondly, whenever I brought up the topic of marriage, they would avoid it.

Zachary even looked at me with disgust.

"Are you that desperate to get married? Isn't the money Reed Enterprises is giving you now enough for you to squander?"

"Everyone knows that whichever Reed daughter marries and has a child first gets the entire Reed fortune. You're pushing us to marry you, but have you considered your sister?"

"Reed Enterprises belongs to her father and mother. Why are you trying to steal it?"

"She's the second daughter of the Reed family. She's suffered for so many years outside, and now that she finally has a chance to live comfortably for a few years, you can't wait to kick her out!"

I stormed out, slamming the door. Later that night, wanting to apologize, I saw him on one knee before Lily, saying earnestly:

"You're the heir I acknowledge, my wife. If you're not ready to accept me yet, I'll pretend to marry her and help you reclaim the property that belongs to you."

"I swear, as long as I'm here, Aria will never be able to bully you."

Only then did I realize they didn't want to get married; they just didn't want to marry me.

But Reed Enterprises was built by my parents. Lily's mother willingly gave up her career to become a kept woman. Lily had been spending my father's money and my mother's inheritance since she was born.

Yet in their eyes, Lily was the pitiful sister and the only Miss Reed.

And I was supposed to hand everything over to Lily without a fight.
