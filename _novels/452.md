On the morning of our planned destination wedding, my fiancée Evelyn finally rushed to the airport from her company. But just before boarding, she suddenly received an urgent message from her male secretary.

"I'm so sorry, honey. The company just got a huge project that needs my approval," she said.

"Why don't you go on the trip first? I'll join you in a few days once I've dealt with all the work stuff."

Though disappointed, I understood the importance of her work and agreed.

After Evelyn left, I tore up my plane ticket.

I decided to go back and see which clueless company dared to discuss a major project with my wife's company - which I had just fully reclaimed that very morning - bypassing me, the current CEO, to find her, a mere figurehead shareholder.
