But I was already too consumed by endless desire to let her be.

I went from softly calling her name to shaking her vigorously.

"Honey, wake up."

Just as my mind was starting to form some unpleasant suspicions,

Lily finally showed a slight reaction. She mumbled in a faint voice, "Sleeping."

Of course, I wasn't going to give up. I pressed closer to her body again, whispering in her ear, "Honey, it's been so long since we've been intimate. How about we go wild tonight?"

As I spoke, my hands started to wander.

She didn't refuse me, so I became even bolder in my actions.

However, I vaguely felt that the skin I was touching was cold, unlike my wife's usual soft and warm body.

Moreover, the scent on her body seemed different from before, giving me a strange sense of novelty.

But just as my hand was about to reach her peaks, she suddenly grabbed my hand.

"No... not now, I need to take a shower first."

Before I could react, she had already scrambled out of bed, wrapped herself in the blanket, and stumbled out of the room in the dark.

Watching this series of actions left me bewildered.

But since she wanted to shower, I could only wait silently, hoping she would be quick.

However, after waiting in the room for a long time, I was starting to doze off. So I got up, intending to go and hurry her along.

Suddenly, I heard voices coming from the living room.

To my surprise, there was another woman in the living room besides my wife Lily.

It was Lily's best friend, Rachel. I had met her a few times before. Rachel was equally stunning in terms of both figure and looks, certainly not inferior to my wife.

Today, she was wearing only a thin T-shirt on top, which perfectly accentuated her flawless figure. She had on a pair of extremely short denim shorts, revealing long, snow-white legs.

She was the type of beauty that would make anyone's imagination run wild after just one glance.

For some reason, Rachel's expression didn't look good, seeming to contain a hint of fear.

"When did you get here?" I asked.

Lily immediately linked arms with Rachel and said to me with a beaming smile, "She just arrived, honey. There's been some disturbance downstairs at Rachel's place lately. She couldn't stand it anymore, so she came to stay with us for the night."

Hearing this, I nodded.

I was about to turn and go back to the bedroom when I suddenly noticed something odd.

"Hey, honey, weren't you taking a shower? Why are you still wearing a dress?"

Lily had said earlier that she was going to shower, but now she was wearing neither pajamas nor a nightgown, but a tight-fitting bodycon dress that she would wear to go out.

She even had high heels on her feet.

Lily rolled her eyes at my question and said impatiently, "Well, Rachel just called me to come down and let her in. I couldn't exactly go down wrapped in a towel, could I?"

I didn't think much of it and turned to go back to the bedroom.

The earlier feeling of arousal was gone, and considering how late it was and that I had an early meeting at the company tomorrow, I ended up falling asleep without continuing what we had left unfinished with my wife.

However, little did I know that Rachel's appearance at our home tonight was not as simple as my wife had made it out to be.
