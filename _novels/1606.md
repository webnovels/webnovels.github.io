At the company dinner, Tyler the intern took a bite of his eel and tossed it directly into my fiancée's plate.

She picked it up without hesitation and ate it.

That night, I tore up our wedding agreement and threw it in the trash.

She took off her glasses, exhausted:

"Over a piece of eel?"

"He took a bite before giving it to you."

Claire let out a cold laugh:

"Adrian, I had no idea you were this petty."

"Fine. No wedding then. Just don't you dare regret it."

She was convinced I loved her too much to ever let go.

But I just smiled:

"Perfect. Saves me from ruining my future."

That same day, I told my parents I wanted to change my marriage arrangement.

Though surprised, they didn't press me with questions. They respected my decision.

As expected, Claire launched into a cold war soon after.

Blocked number, deleted contact, cut off all communication. Her methods were smooth as a rehearsed routine.

She remained confident that I'd come crawling back like I always did.

But this time, I stared at that familiar friend request notification on my screen and never hit confirm.

A week later, a message popped up in the company group chat:

"Miss Sullivan's birthday celebration tonight. Everyone must attend."

Not wanting to cause a scene, I went anyway.

I pushed open the private room door and immediately spotted Claire at the head seat, with Tyler practically pressed against her ear, whispering something.

They were deep in conversation, like they existed in their own little bubble that no one else could penetrate.

As they laughed, they leaned closer and closer, almost like they were about to kiss.

I looked away and took a seat in the corner, drinking alone.

Colleagues took turns presenting their gifts. I didn't move.

Until a shadow fell across my table.

I looked up to find Claire's bright face tinged with displeasure.

"Adrian, where's my gift?"

In the past, I would've started preparing months in advance for a day like this.

I once spent weeks building her a replica of that walking mechanical castle from Clockwork Heart.

When the gears started turning and steam poured from the copper pipes, she gently took my hand and said:

"We'll be just like Erin and Kyle. No matter where this castle goes, we'll always find each other."

Back then, I believed her. I never imagined her "forever" wouldn't even last three years.

"Forgot."

My response was flat.

Claire's expression darkened:

"How long are you going to keep this up? Over something so trivial?"

My gaze drifted to her smudged lipstick, courtesy of Tyler, and I felt my stomach turn:

"I'm not keeping anything up. Canceling the wedding is serious."

Her expression stiffened briefly, but she regained her composure when Tyler took her hand.

"Don't get the wrong idea,"

Tyler explained softly.

"I just didn't want to waste food. If it bothers you that much, next time I'll just wait until everyone's done eating."

His words instantly triggered Claire's protective instincts:

"Tyler, you deserve the best! Adrian should be the one leaving. Who does he think he is?"

Tyler walked over and patted my shoulder:

"Come on, man. Be the bigger person. Claire hasn't been sleeping well these past few days. I know you two aren't compatible, but you're still engaged..."

I knocked his hand away with a cold laugh:

"Tyler, you know what I admire most about you?"

"You play both sides and still manage to steal someone's fiancée without batting an eye."

The second Tyler's smile froze, Claire exploded:

"Adrian, how dare you slander Tyler!"

"Slander? Then explain why he has an identical copy of everything you've ever given me?"

"Why does he somehow know about every fight we have before anyone else? And why does he know you have a small mole on your chest—"

"Enough!"

A sharp slap echoed through the room.

My left ear rang. My vision blurred. All I could see were my colleagues' pitying and mocking stares, silently bearing down on me.

The ringing gradually faded.

In its place came Claire's clear, triumphant declaration:

"Starting today, everyone's welcome to like the photos of me and Tyler together. Once we hit a thousand likes, I'll call off the engagement and marry Tyler instead."

Before I could respond, she grabbed Tyler's hand and walked out without looking back.

As they passed me, Tyler shot me an unmistakable look of victory.

After they left, gleeful whispers floated through the room:

"Acting all high and mighty. Now it's too late for regrets."

A colleague I knew well came over and spoke quietly:

"Adrian, just go apologize. You can't seriously let Miss Sullivan make a rash decision like this..."

I knew this was just another one of her tactics to make me submit.

But this time, I refused to give in.
