I'm a relationship tarot reader. At a party, my husband's female colleague asked me to read her love fortune. My husband suddenly became anxious, "You always talk nonsense! You'll make her cry!"

But his colleague had already drawn the tarot cards on the table.

Looking at the cards, I answered honestly:

"This man is very handsome and a high-level executive in the company, but he's already married."

The female colleague glanced at my husband, "Will we have a future together?"

My husband's breath caught for a moment.

I deliberately curled my lips:

"No, you won't. If you insist on being together, you'll end up in a terrible situation."
