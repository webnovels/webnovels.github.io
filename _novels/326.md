In our three years of marriage, my wife hypnotized me three times.
The first time, when her childhood friend and I were competing for a board position at the company, my wife personally broke both my hands, turning me into a cripple.
The second time, when her childhood friend needed liquid capital, she sold my luxury cars and mansion, and took out massive loans in my name.
The third time, when her childhood friend was severely injured in a car accident, she forcibly harvested our son's eyes and liver for transplantation.
Each time, I furiously demanded a divorce, wanting to cut all ties with her.
But she would cling to me, crying, saying she'd go insane without me.
She even forcibly hypnotized me to forget everything, just to keep me by her side as if nothing had happened.
It wasn't until the day of our son's funeral that I accidentally discovered the whole truth.
"Ms. Chloe, this is the fourth hypnosis session. One more could cause irreversible damage to your husband's brain. He might become mentally unstable. Are you sure you want to proceed?" the doctor asked.
"He must forget what happened today! If not, he'll definitely leave me. I can't allow him to pose any threat to Marcus!" Chloe insisted.
The doctor sighed, "Why do you need to trample on your husband's sincere love to this extent?"
"I have no choice. Who told him to possess exactly what Marcus needs? For Marcus's happiness, I'm willing to be the villain," Chloe replied coldly.
Hearing this conversation, I felt as if my blood had frozen. My fists clenched involuntarily, but I kept my eyes tightly shut, pretending to be asleep.
I had only been looking for my absent wife at our son's funeral when I accidentally stumbled upon her hosting a lavish birthday party for her childhood friend at a five-star hotel.
Before I could confront her, someone knocked me unconscious. When I came to, I overheard this conversation between the doctor and my wife.
The doctor continued heatedly, "But your husband's hand injury was severe. You made the hospital deliberately misalign his tendons. He endures excruciating pain every day."
"You lied to him, saying he had a gambling addiction and owed debts. You told him there wasn't enough money for pain medication, yet you emptied his bank account to throw this extravagant birthday party for Marcus! Do you really hate him that much?"
Chloe shook her head, "How could I possibly hate him?"
"It's all for Marcus. His greatest dream is to be the company's leader, so I'll be the woman who silently supports him from behind."
"As for Jack, if he must blame someone, blame him for shining too brightly and blocking others' paths. I had to turn him into a helpless cripple to feel at ease..."
The doctor wanted to say more, but Chloe coldly cut him off.
"Enough. Watch your mouth. If you let slip even half a word to Jack, I won't let you off easy!"
"Hurry up and erase his memory. Make him think he caused some trouble today. That way, he'll stay by my side out of guilt, never leaving me."
Chloe's hand gently caressed my face.
But I could no longer feel any of the love I once thought was there.
Five years ago, when Chloe's family company went bankrupt, I gave her a billion dollars to help her rebuild.
When Marcus was kicked out of his family for being an illegitimate child, I was the one who kindly took him in at the company, gradually promoting him to a high position.
At the time, Marcus knelt before me, saying he would repay this life-saving kindness someday.
Chloe also confessed her love to me, saying she had liked me for a long time.
But I never imagined that later, Chloe would steal my assets for Marcus, then trick me into believing I had gambled away all my money.
She even put on a complete act, moving with me to a tiny apartment in the poorest part of town, living a life of extreme poverty to save every penny.
Later, when Marcus was in a car accident, she cut open our son and harvested his organs to save Marcus's life.
While our son was dying in agony, Chloe was busy wiping Marcus's body and feeding him.
I had angrily argued with her countless times. Each time, Chloe would kneel and beg my forgiveness, pleading with me not to leave, saying she would go crazy without me.
If I insisted on leaving, she would use hypnosis to make me forget everything.
I had already forgotten three times, and this was nearly the fourth.
When I opened my eyes after the hypnosis ended, I saw Chloe looking at me with reddened eyes. Seeing me awake, she hugged me and burst into tears.
"Jack, thank goodness you're awake," she sobbed.
"You were so devastated by our son's death that you got into a fight at the hospital. When I saw your head bleeding, I thought I would go mad. If you left me too, I really couldn't go on living!"
The concern in her eyes seemed so genuine, but I no longer felt any trace of being moved.
Chloe didn't notice anything amiss. She turned and took out a takeout container from a cheap plastic bag, holding it preciously before me.
"Jack, you must be hungry. Look what I brought you! I snuck this out while working as a cleaner at the hotel. It's high-grade steak and Wagyu beef."
Ever since our family went bankrupt, Chloe would always cry about how all the money she earned from work went to pay off debts. Feeling sorry for her, I would eat very little each day, enduring dizziness and hunger pangs.
But today I had clearly seen at Marcus's birthday party how abalone and sea cucumber were served endlessly. This steak was merely scraps.
Marcus had even deliberately stepped on the container and spat in it, telling the waiter to add raw blood to make it disgusting and inedible, saying it was food for dogs.
In the past, the so-called gourmet food Chloe brought back always tasted terrible, but I would force myself to eat it all, not wanting to waste her kindness.
Now I felt nauseated. I discreetly pushed her hand away, not acknowledging her gesture.
But Chloe wasn't angry. Instead, she looked surprised and delighted as she grasped my hand, examining it closely.
"Your hand can move now?" she exclaimed.
