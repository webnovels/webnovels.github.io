I never thought I’d run into Chloe again, not at a gala on my very first day back in the country. She was dazzling, draped around Julian, her gaze soft and affectionate. 

Amidst the clinking glasses and flowing conversations, guests showered them with compliments.

“Ms. Davies and her husband have been married for years, yet they seem even more in love than when they first tied the knot.”

“Mr. Julian is truly blessed. Ms. Davies threw this party tonight to welcome the Princess Royal of the East Coast elite. Her business ventures are about to take off like a rocket!”

Chloe smiled, looking tenderly at Julian. 

“Marrying Julian is the greatest blessing of my life. His touring art exhibition is coming up in a few days; I hope everyone can come show their support.”

At the mention of the art exhibition, someone in the crowd asked, puzzled, “Ms. Davies, you’ve been married for six years, but why has Mr. Julian never held an exhibition before?”

Julian cared so much about his art. How could he not have held an exhibition for six years? It was a question I’d always wondered myself.

In my past life, Chloe loved Julian so fiercely she was willing to die for him.

 Even after I was reborn, she defied her powerful family, the Davies, just to marry him.

Julian’s pleasant smile faltered instantly when he heard the question. “Painting is quite draining, and Chloe is simply worried I might strain my eyes.”

The men in the room listened, both envious and praising Chloe as the perfect wife.

In my past life, after I married Chloe, I wanted to hold a design exhibition. But Chloe’s mother scolded me, accusing me of trying to steal the spotlight. 

She constantly felt I wasn’t good enough for Chloe and repeatedly tried to get her to divorce me. 

After Chloe became the group heiress, her mother actually had a lawyer draft divorce papers.

Now, Chloe handled Julian’s art exhibition entirely herself, with him not lifting a finger. It turned out, in my last life, I was the one who was never truly loved.

I let out a soft, bitter laugh, shaking my head. Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a figure beneath the long table, ready to follow them.

But then I bumped into a waiter carrying a tray of red wine. Glass shattered everywhere, and wine splattered all over me.

“Watch where you’re going! That was for the Princess Royal’s husband!”

“If the gentleman complains, you’ll be out of a job!”

The waiter’s loud scolding immediately drew everyone’s attention. I looked up and explained, “It’s fine, I didn't really like that wine anyway.”

Chloe looked over, startled. “Alex, what are you doing here?”

Others quickly chimed in, “Who is this?”

Chloe’s tone was dismissive. “Just a university classmate. He was totally obsessed with me back then; the whole school knew he wanted to marry me. After graduation, he still spent all his energy trying to chase me down.”

“But my heart has always belonged only to Julian.”

Hearing this, everyone’s gazes and voices filled with mocking amusement. Chloe gripped her wine glass, her voice stern. 

“Please, don’t spread rumors! I don’t want my husband to misunderstand!”

Julian wrapped an arm around Chloe’s shoulders, his voice soft. “Oh, darling, don’t be upset. Mr. Alex must just be terribly infatuated to follow you all the way here.”

Chloe’s brow furrowed. She turned to someone beside her. “Take him out. I’ll handle this.”

With that, she leaned in and kissed Julian’s cheek, her eyes filled with sweet affection, not even sparing me a glance.

“It’s only because Ms. Davies is so kind, otherwise, you’d be in serious trouble.”

“Get out of here. This isn’t a place for someone like you.”

I struggled to break free from their grip. “I’m here looking for someone.”

The staff smirked, looking at my rough linen clothes with blatant disdain.

 “We’ve seen plenty of men like you, trying to win Ms. Davies’ favor with pathetic infatuation. Don’t waste your breath.”

They finished speaking, then forcibly shoved me out the door.

“Stop.”

Suddenly, a familiar voice called out from behind me.
