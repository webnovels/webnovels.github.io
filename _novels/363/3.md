That evening, at the city's most exclusive revolving restaurant, Liam had meticulously set up a romantic scene.

Red roses adorned the table, along with a velvet jewelry box containing a diamond necklace he had specially chosen.

He held a bouquet of flowers in his arms, glancing at his watch repeatedly.

Why wasn't Audrey here yet?

Liam called her, but the ring tone indicated her phone was off.

He tried again from a different number, still off.

He felt an inexplicable irritation and unease.

Chloe's call came in just then, crying that her dog's condition had worsened and urging him to come quickly.

Liam felt annoyed and quickly brushed her off.

His heart grew increasingly unsettled. He suddenly remembered Audrey's unusual coldness and calmness during their phone call yesterday, and his heart tightened.

She seemed... different.

He instructed his assistant, "If my wife arrives, tell her to wait for me for a while. I'll be back soon."

Then he left the restaurant in a hurry.

At the vet, though he was with Chloe, his mind was completely elsewhere.

He kept checking his phone; there was still no news from his assistant, and Audrey hadn't shown up.

He felt a sense of panic he'd never experienced before.

He couldn't sit still any longer and decided to go look for Audrey himself.

He planned to say goodbye to Chloe, but as he reached the door of the examination room, he heard Chloe's deliberately lowered voice inside.

"Derek, don't worry, Liam is completely wrapped around my finger now."

"As for that bitch Audrey, she's utterly disgraced now. I doubt she can cause any trouble."

"Once I climb into the upper class, we can team up, find more wealthy housewives like Audrey, take their private photos, and then we won't have to worry about money, right? Hahaha..."

Liam's eyes instantly turned bloodshot.

So, this was all a setup!

Chloe and Derek had conspired to frame Audrey!

And he, like a fool, had been played by Chloe, personally pushing his own wife into the abyss!

Regret and fury instantly consumed his heart.

Liam was about to burst into the room when his assistant called.

"Mr. Scott, it's bad! I just received a delivery—a divorce agreement from your wife!"

A divorce agreement?

Liam felt as if he'd been struck by lightning.

She wanted to divorce him?

No, impossible!

She loved him so much; how could she bear to divorce him?!

He refused to believe it, couldn't accept it.

He frantically called Audrey, but the line was still busy.
