Just before the 2024 Senior Year Finals, the Department of Education made an explosive announcement.
—All high school seniors would get a ten-day break.

My classmates cheered wildly, "We've been in school for 100 straight days, finally we're free!"

Mom stared at the news, her face blank. "Is a vacation bought with a life really worth it?"

Yeah, is it?

But Mom had already pushed me to my death.

Right before the finals, Mom rallied all the parents to petition the school: absolutely no breaks before the exams.

The parents argued, "The finals are around the corner! The kids need to be locked down in school, under strict control!"

The school sided with the parents. For a hundred consecutive days before the finals, there were no breaks.

Under immense pressure, students started falling ill. Mr. Harrison called an emergency class meeting. "Getting sick now is irresponsible to yourselves."

My stomach pain was unbearable. I secretly went off-campus to see a doctor, hiding it from both Mom and the school. But Mom found out.

That night, during evening study hall, Mom burst into the classroom. She slapped me across the face. "You want to rest? Go on, jump off the building if you're so tough! You can rest once you're dead!"

The words had barely left her lips when I pulled open the window and leaped from the fourth floor.

As my consciousness faded, I heard Mom ask Mr. Harrison, "These injuries, they won't delay her third mock exam review, will they?"
