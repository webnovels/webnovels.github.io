I am the daughter of a billionaire, returning home to take over the family business.

Little did I know that simply attending a gala on my brother's arm would lead to such disaster.

Finn's sickly girlfriend, Charlotte, mistook me for the other woman.

In my previous life, she cut off both my hands and had thugs torture me for three days and nights.

"My boyfriend comes from a noble family. A slut like you has no right to pursue him. Know your place and rot in the gutter where you belong!" Charlotte had sneered.

Dr. Young, my doctor, begged my brother on his knees to avenge me, but Finn remained unmoved.

"Even if she is my sister, if her death makes Charlotte happy, then so be it," Finn had said coldly.

To cover up Charlotte's crime, he even ran over the doctor with his car when the man tried to seek justice for me at the police station.

When I opened my eyes again, I found myself back at the moment Charlotte was about to cut off my hands.

This time, I ignored the call from my heartless brother and dialed my father instead.

"Dad, make sure none of our hospitals treat Charlotte for her illness," I said firmly.

"Also, cancel all of Finn's inheritance rights and kick him out of the family."

I wanted to see who would end up rotting in the gutter this time.
