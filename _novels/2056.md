My sister Scarlett has always had this thing about taking what's mine—started when we were kids and never stopped.

When we were little, she pointed at my trophy and spoke her first real sentence.

"I want it."

Before I could even blink, Mom and Dad pried that trophy right out of my hands and handed it over.

In middle school, she set her sights on the bike I'd slaved away at part-time jobs for months to buy.

"I want it."

Again, Mom and Dad took it away without a second thought—left me walking to school all through middle and high school.

That phrase became her superpower over the years, letting her take just about everything that mattered to me.

Every time, I’d cry and fight back, but it was useless.

Mom and Dad always, always took her side—like my feelings didn't even exist.

This holiday season, I brought my boyfriend Liam home to meet the family.

Scarlett pointed straight at Liam and said those three words that had haunted me my whole life.

"I want him."



The words barely left her mouth before Mom and Dad fixed him with that same sharp, calculating look I knew so well.

Sure enough, Mom grabbed my arm next second, her voice oozing that entitled tone I'd grown to hate.

"Scarlett hasn't dated anyone since college. She finally likes someone—just let her have him, okay?"

Dad nodded along enthusiastically.

"That boyfriend of yours is a real catch. Him and Scarlett would make a great couple."

Liam stood behind me, looking completely dumbfounded.

He nudged my back gently, his voice dropping to a disbelieving whisper: "Hazel, is this some kind of sick joke? They want me to be with Scarlett? This is insane!"

A bitter laugh escaped me—dry, humorless, and completely hollow.

Ridiculous? Please.

This was just another Tuesday in our house.

My whole life, Scarlett had stolen everything from me—trophies, my bike, even my parents' love. Now they wanted me to hand over the person I loved most?

After college, I moved away for work thinking distance might fix their obvious favoritism. Maybe they'd miss me, show me a little real affection for once.

But now I saw how wrong I'd been.

They hadn't changed one bit. If Scarlett wanted something—even my happiness—they'd yank it away without hesitation.

I took a deep breath, shoving down the disappointment burning in my chest.

"Fine. She can have him."

"Hazel, don't be dramatic... Wait, what? You're agreeing?"

Dad's scolding fizzled out, his face going slack with shock.

His surprise wasn't unwarranted.

Back then, I'd scream and cry, even starve myself to protest when Scarlett took my stuff.

But this time, I was just exhausted.

If they wanted to cater to Scarlett's every demand, fine. I didn't have the energy to fight anymore.

Mom's face lit up instantly, a huge relieved smile spreading across her face.

"Hazel, you've really matured! Such a thoughtful daughter!"

Liam finally caught on. He jumped up, grabbing his jacket, voice shaking with anger.

"Hazel, what am I to you? Some toy you can just hand off? Your whole family's crazy!"

With that, he stormed for the door.

Mom and Dad tried to call him back, but all they got was a loud slam.

The door crashed shut hard enough to rattle the walls.

My heart shattered along with that loud noise—into a million tiny pieces.

I really loved him, but in this family? I couldn't even hold onto the person I cared about.

Scarlett didn't even bat an eye at Liam leaving.

She never actually liked him—she just got off on taking what was mine.
