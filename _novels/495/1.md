"Officer, I'm at XX University, 3rd floor of the teaching building. Someone is trying to rob me, deliberately damaging my property, and assaulting me."

Lucas's face changed dramatically. He lunged forward. "Are you crazy?!"

He snatched my phone and, without even looking, threw it out the window.

Crack!

The phone smashed onto the cement ground below, its screen shattering.

The classroom fell silent for a second.

But to their surprise, in less than ten minutes, the sound of police sirens echoed from below.

When the police entered the classroom, Vanessa and Lucas's faces instantly turned pale.

"Who called the police?" the lead officer asked, looking around.

"I did," I raised my hand. "They tried to rob me and smashed my phone."

The officer looked at the scattered items on the ground, then at my broken camera and the smashed phone outside the window. His brow furrowed. "What happened here?"

Vanessa immediately put on an innocent act. "Officer, it's a misunderstanding! We were just playing around!"

Lucas quickly chimed in, "Yeah, yeah, it was just a joke between classmates!"

Other classmates also started to testify.

I coldly scanned the room. These people were exactly the same as when they gave false testimony in my previous life.

The officer let out a cold laugh. "Smashing phones and hitting people, you call that a joke?"

Mr. Wilson, our counselor, rushed in upon hearing the news, his face ashen. "What's going on?! How could you cause such a scene at school?!"

The officer briefly explained the situation. After listening, Mr. Wilson glared at Vanessa. "You again!"

Vanessa tried to argue, but the evidence was irrefutable.

In the end, under the mediation of the police, Vanessa and Lucas had to compensate me for my phone and camera, and apologize publicly.

As we left the office, Lucas lowered his voice, gritting his teeth, "Aria Johnson, you just wait and see!"

Looking at his twisted expression, I suddenly smiled.

"Sure, I'll be waiting."

When I returned to the dorm to pack my things, I felt like someone had gone through my stuff, but nothing was missing, so I didn't pay much attention.

Just as I walked out of the school, a black Maybach stopped in front of me.

"Miss Johnson, Madam has an important matter and needs you to return home immediately."

Butler James didn't let me speak, directly pulling me into the car.

That evening, my mother pushed two documents in front of me, her gaze sharp as a knife.

"Aria, this is your last chance to choose. The right to inherit the family's $3 billion trust fund, or a monthly allowance of $1,500."

"The $3 billion has already been deposited into your Swiss Bank card. As soon as you sign, you can access that money and take over the family business."

The crystal chandelier behind my mother refracted a dazzling light. I squinted, momentarily seeing that car rushing towards me again, hearing the crisp sound of bones being crushed.

Vanessa's triumphant sneer from my previous life still echoed in my ears.

"I choose the monthly allowance of $1,500."
