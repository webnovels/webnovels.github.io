My flight to Hokkaido for Christmas was cancelled. I dragged my suitcase back home, defeated.

The moment I opened the door, I saw it – candlelight dinner for two on the table, and clothes scattered like fallen leaves across the floor.

This wasn't the first time I'd walked in on Mark and his little secretary doing this. I'd honestly lost count.

The sounds of labored breathing coming from the bedroom were like a fingernail on a chalkboard.

But, unlike the old me, I didn't scream or cry. I just sat down on the living room couch and waited for the ridiculous scene to play itself out.
