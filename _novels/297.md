My wife’s older cousin, Isabelle, had married a Middle Eastern tycoon. She was almost forty, and they still hadn’t had children.

One day, Isabelle came to our door, explaining she was infertile and hoped my wife could help her have a baby.

I rejected the idea instantly, without a second thought. I told my wife, straight up, that if she dared to agree, I'd divorce her.

A year later, Isabelle suddenly invited me to her baby's first-month celebration.

But Isabelle couldn't have children, could she? Had my wife actually agreed to that Middle Eastern tycoon’s request behind my back?

…

This past New Year, my wife’s older cousin, Isabelle, came back from overseas with her husband for the first time in over ten years.

My wife's parents had passed away early, and her aunt (Isabelle’s mother) had taken great care of her. So, Chloe and Isabelle had practically grown up together, and they were very close.

When Chloe heard Isabelle was back, she dragged me along, eager to visit them the very next day.

Isabelle said their house hadn't been lived in for a while and wasn't ready, so she arranged to meet us at a fancy restaurant instead.

The moment we stepped into the private room, a man over six feet tall, with a long beard, extended his hand. He greeted us in fluent English.

"Hello, I'm Isabelle's husband. Just call me Omar. I'm from Saudi Arabia!"

I only knew my cousin-in-law had married a rich and powerful foreigner.

I just hadn't expected him to be a Middle Eastern tycoon, wearing a traditional head covering.

"Hello, Omar. I hope you'll stay for a few days this time."

"Absolutely, absolutely."

Omar was speaking to me, but his gaze kept drifting to my wife.

His eyes held an unmistakable, raw possessiveness.

It was no surprise. My wife, Chloe, was incredibly beautiful, with a stunning figure. Her generous E-cup bust always turned heads wherever she went.

I frowned, a flicker of annoyance passing through me. Even if we were family, that was incredibly rude.

My name is Alex. I worked a demanding corporate job, and overtime was the norm. I was living paycheck to paycheck, barely making ends meet.

No silver spoon, no lucky breaks. All I could do was work harder.

It took years of savings, but I finally managed to buy our small house with a mortgage.

I met Chloe through a mutual friend.

Our daily lives weren't luxurious, but they were calm, peaceful, and truly happy.

This year, I'd finally managed to save up a bit, and we were planning to start a family.

We were currently trying to conceive.

…

"Come, sit, sit! Waiter, bring the food!"

Omar ushered us to our seats, pulling out gifts he’d brought from overseas.

"Wow, is this for me?"

Chloe's eyes lit up with delight as she excitedly hugged a white, deep-V, ultra-low-cut evening gown.

Isabelle smiled.

"Of course! Omar specifically commissioned a renowned designer for royalty. It took two months to design, and every stitch was hand-sewn. It's pure couture!"

Chloe excitedly hugged Omar’s arm. "Thank you so much, cousin-in-law! You're the best!"

Seeing that, I felt a pang of jealousy.

What man could stand seeing his wife so intimate with another man?

But then I remembered how, when we got married, we were so broke we had to rent her wedding dress.

So, seeing Chloe so genuinely happy, I swallowed my resentment.

At the dinner table, Chloe and Isabelle were whispering, gossiping about something.

I tried to listen in, but Omar kept pulling me into conversation, urging me to drink.

A few shots of hard liquor later, I, who wasn't much of a drinker, started to feel lightheaded.

I excused myself to the restroom.

After splashing cold water on my face, I was about to step out when I heard Chloe and Isabelle’s voices.

"Chloe, please, think about this carefully. I'm begging you. In my husband's country, not having children is a huge dishonor. Besides, Omar is so wealthy, he needs an heir! If I can't give him a child, he'll divorce me sooner or later. Please, think about my future."

"Isabelle, I'll… I'll think about it."

I chose that exact moment to walk out, smiling.

"What are you two talking about?"

A blush immediately spread across Chloe's face, and her eyes darted away from mine.

She playfully shoved me. "Go on, shoo! It's girl talk, none of your business!"

I knew my wife too well. She was clearly feeling guilty.

Instinctively, I felt something was definitely off!

Isabelle hadn't been back in so many years, and her sudden return definitely had some hidden agenda!

"Honey, honey, do I look pretty?"

The moment we got home, Chloe changed into the white evening gown and twirled around, showing it off.

The dress was cut perfectly.

It beautifully showcased Chloe's full curves and generous bust, making my eyes light up.

No wonder Chloe was so excited; the dress truly looked high-end.

But my wife's cousin hadn't been back in years, and the moment she returned, she gave such an expensive gift.

Who would believe there wasn't a motive behind it?
