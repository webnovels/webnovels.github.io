"Alice, why are you being like this? Ryan just wants to fulfill Chloe's dreams, that's all."

"Yeah, Chloe's had it rough all these years. It's just a few wishes, you're being so petty."

Ryan's cronies, who had followed him out, chimed in, talking over each other.

Even Blake Sullivan, Ryan's younger brother, whom I had always had a soft spot for, spoke up. "Sis-in-law, my brother isn't even married to you yet, you're acting way too entitled."

"Don't you believe my brother could drop you in a second? You're just yesterday's news, who's going to pick you up now?"

He finished speaking, and a few of them exchanged glances, then burst into snickers.

Ryan, still holding Chloe close, scoffed mockingly. "Are you really sure about this? Don't come crying and begging for my forgiveness later."

I was genuinely exhausted. I didn't want to argue with them anymore.

Just then, a familiar Maybach pulled up nearby. Without a word, I opened the passenger door and got in.

Ryan's face instantly crumpled like he was constipated.

He roared, "Alice! Get out of there right now! We can still talk this through!"

Julian Blackwood let out a soft chuckle, then leaned over to help me fasten my seatbelt.

"Take me home first. I need to pack some things."

"Okay. Pack everything clean."

After so many years together, Ryan had given me a lot of expensive things.

I called a luxury consignment store and arranged for them to pick up all my bags and jewelry.

There was so much that they could only take a portion, promising to return for the rest tomorrow.

I rubbed my throbbing temples, ordered some takeout, and started scrolling through Ins while I ate.

My eyes landed on a kissing photo.

Ryan was tenderly cupping Chloe Miller's face, his gaze full of deep affection.

Then, there were videos his friends had posted in their SnapChat group.

The two of them were passionately kissing amidst cheers and whistles, the sickening sound of their kissing making my stomach churn. I felt like I was going to throw up.

I immediately left the group.

The next second, Ryan's call came through.

"Alice, we were just kidding around, how many times have I told you? These are my best friends, and you just left the group without a word. Are you planning to never speak to us again?"

I just hummed softly.

"What do you mean by that?"

Blake’s voice cut in. "Don't worry, bro, she won't. She’s too dependent. She'll be begging you to add her back in a couple of days."

I hung up the phone and let out a light, cynical chuckle.

In the past, I really would have swallowed my pride and begged them, but not anymore.

I needed to get far, far away from them.

That night, as I tried to sleep, the wedding photos on my bedside table and dressing table felt like burning eyesores.

I immediately took them down and replaced them with a photo of Ryan and Chloe that I found in his study.

Ryan should probably thank me for that.

The next morning, Ryan came back, looking surprisingly refreshed.

His eyes lit up when he saw me, and he lifted his chin, looking at me confidently. "I knew you’d be waiting for me here at home, Alice."

"Alice, I really should have come back to you yesterday. It was all Chloe's fault, she said she was afraid of the dark, so I stayed. It won't happen again, I promise..."

His expression froze when he saw the luxury consignment people carrying my bags away.

He looked at me, a tense worry in his eyes. "Alice, why are you selling the things I gave you?"

I replied calmly, "They were taking up too much space. I'm making room for new things."

He happily took my hand. "Good. I'll get you new ones."

I frowned and pulled my hand away.

He seemed to have completely misunderstood my meaning.

I was talking about making room for Chloe's things.

I was moving out.
