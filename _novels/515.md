Just because I accidentally hurt Julian Vance’s mistress while bathing her.

Julian threw my gravely ill mother out into the pouring rain, leaving her to die alone.

After Mom passed, I handed him the divorce papers, begging him to let me go.

But he just stared at me with a stone-cold face, kicking me to the ground.

“Anya Reed, you’re really getting into this act, aren’t you? Haven’t you heard that people can actually die from getting rained on?”

“Besides, I’ve supported you two parasites for so many years. If you want to leave, you’ll have to compensate me tens of millions.”

I nodded calmly. A few days later, a massive sum landed in his account.

He didn’t know, that was the price of my life.
