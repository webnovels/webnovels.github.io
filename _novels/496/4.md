Everyone was terrified, but the prince acted as if nothing had happened and calmly turned to look at Isabelle.

"Beautiful lady, is this pair of shoes yours?"

Isabelle's face was pale, but unable to suppress her desire to become a princess, she still nodded.

This time, the prince cut off her heel.

Blood sprayed everywhere, dripping through the cracks in the wooden floor. I was terrified, looking around frantically but finding nowhere to hide.

Madame Tremaine screamed and went to embrace her two daughters. The prince put his sword to her throat.

"Are there any other daughters in your house?"

Madame Tremaine's lips trembled.

"No, no more..."

Despite their severe injuries, both sisters gritted their teeth and insisted there was no one else in the house. The resolve of the mother and daughters to prevent me from becoming princess was unexpectedly strong.

Thank you all.

"What about young maids? None of those either?"

Madame Tremaine continued shaking her head. The prince laughed and sat down in a chair, using a clean white cloth to wipe his long sword.

"Well, isn't that interesting!"

The prince waved his hand, and his attendants scattered to search the house. Soon, Lord Roderick ran to the prince's side.

"Your Highness, the attic door is locked."

The prince looked at Madame Tremaine.

"This is your last chance to live. Open the door."

The prince's eyes were sharp, his tense jawline showing that his patience had reached its limit. Seeing Madame Tremaine standing still, Lord Roderick drew his sword.

"Kill her. You all, go break down the door."

Only then did Madame Tremaine react, screaming and crawling towards the attic door.

"I'll open it, I'll open it, don't kill me—"

The sound of keys and chains clashing rang out, and the attic door was forcefully pulled open. A beam of light shone diagonally into the attic.

In the dusty beam of light, the prince stood before me with a wicked smile.

"Ha, found you."
