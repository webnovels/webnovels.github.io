In my impression, Cinderella was always mistreated by her stepmother and forced to do chores. Whenever the housework became too overwhelming, she would start singing, and then many birds and small animals would come out to help her.

This was a special ability of Disney princesses. Now that I had become Cinderella, shouldn't I have this ability too?

I cleared my throat.

"Ooooh ooooh ooooh~ Aaaah aaaah~"

No response. Maybe I was doing it wrong. I continued singing.

"Eeee eeee eeee~ Oooo oooo~"

I sang repeatedly for half an hour, until my throat was dry, but I didn't give up. Finally, that mouse crept out from the corner again.

I was delighted and crouched down to look at it.

"Are you here to help me?"

The mouse squeaked, its limbs twitching, and fell to the ground.

Me: "..."

I sat on the ground hugging my knees. Just as I was at a loss, I heard chaotic footsteps from above and Madame Tremaine's shrill voice.

"Oh my, Prince Henry, you've come personally! Heavens!"

I looked up through the cracks in the wooden floor. The prince still carried that long sword from last night. He smiled and gestured for his attendant to press Victoria onto a chair.

"Beautiful Lady Victoria, is this pair of glass slippers yours?"

Victoria's face turned red, and she nodded shyly.

The attendant tried to put the shoe on Victoria's foot, but her foot was too wide and wouldn't fit no matter how they tried.

Victoria became anxious.

"I... I'm a bit swollen today."

"Is that so? But you must wear the shoe to become my princess."

The prince's expression was cold. Hearing this, Victoria desperately tried to squeeze her foot into the shoe, her instep turning red from the effort.

The prince laughed coldly and raised his sword.

"Let me help you—"

The prince's blade fell, cutting off half of Victoria's foot. She screamed and rolled on the ground, clutching her leg.
