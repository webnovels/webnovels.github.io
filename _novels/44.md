I am a Reaper who ventured into the mortal world to save the woman I love.

Olivia.

I defied fate's repeated calls for her death, and after five years of knowing and loving each other, we were about to get married.

On our wedding day, she discovered my identity as a Reaper.

She ran away from the wedding and used her own life to blackmail me into saving her ex-boyfriend who had cancer.

"If you don't save him, I'll die with him!" she threatened.

Later, when death came for her again, I took her life as commanded.

But she cried until her eyes were bloodshot, kneeling on the ground begging me.

"Honey, I regret it. Please, save me one more time."
