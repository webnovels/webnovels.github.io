Declan's hand around my waist froze, his gaze cold. "How long are you going to keep this up?"

"Asher is just a child! Besides, you're his mom. Isn't it your fault for not educating him well? I haven't even blamed you, yet you're causing a scene!"

Mom? I looked at him indifferently. When did Declan and his son ever consider me a wife and mom?

Back then, Declan Perry, the Prince of the Beijing Circle, fell in love with my sister at first sight and insisted on marrying her. But the elders of the Perry Family disagreed, so he eloped abroad with my sister in a fit of anger.

The two of them lived in blissful happiness. But since Perry Corporation only had one heir, Declan had to return to inherit the family business. On their way back home, they got into a car accident. My pregnant sister died from hemorrhaging during labor, leaving only the premature son.

The family couldn't afford to lose Declan, their cash cow, so I was asked to take care of my little nephew in the Perry Family. But Declan was unwilling to marry me. Even though I took on the title of Mrs. Perry and played the role of Asher's mom for seven years, we never registered our marriage.

The world called me his mistress, and it wasn't without reason. I pursed my lips. "Mr. Perry, you promised that when Asher reached school age, you'd let me go."

"After all, I'm not really your wife. Staying here in the Perry Family isn't good for your reputation."

Hearing my words, Declan's cold expression softened a bit. The way he looked at me was almost gentle.

"If you attend the launch event with me, who would dare gossip?"

"As for the rest, it's not that I won't..."

"No need." I interrupted his unfinished words.

In the first half of my life, I was cursed as an unwanted child. I don't want to spend the latter half being called a mistress.

"Asher is ready for school. I've already found him an international school. I'm really not cut out for raising kids."

"As for everything at the Perry Family's old house, the housekeeper can handle it without me."

Declan pinched my waist and threw me onto the bed. He looked down at me, all gentleness gone, his voice as cold as ice.

"Nora Taylor, who do you think you are!"

"This Perry Family isn't a place you can come and go as you please!"

"You're attending the launch with me in three days. You have no choice."

With a bang, the door slammed shut, shaking the walls. The painting on the wall fell and shattered into pieces.

Looking at the fragments on the floor, I bit my lip and couldn't help but cry. That painting was done by Declan for me. But the person in the painting wasn't me; it was my sister.

The day before I went to the Perry Family to take care of Asher, Mrs. Taylor warned me.

"If it weren't for my daughter's misfortune and you looking like her, you shameless woman wouldn't stand a chance!"

"When you get to the Perry Family, you'd better behave and take good care of my grandson, or don't blame me for being harsh!"

She wasn't wrong. I've been by Declan's side for seven years. If it weren't for my resemblance to my sister, he wouldn't have painted me during his free time.

Those were the rare moments of warmth I could remember. From childhood to now, only when Declan painted me did I feel a hint of warmth.

But seven years made me realize it was all fake.

The door was kicked open. Asher Perry stormed in angrily, holding the custom gown Declan had prepared for me. His eyes were red as he glared at me with hatred.

"You wicked woman, you really want to replace my mom!"

"Dream on about attending the launch!"

He cursed as he cut the gown into shreds with scissors. Only when the gown was completely ruined did he feel pleased and stomped on it several times.

Worried he might hurt himself with the scissors, I tried to snatch them from him but was met with a swipe that left a long cut on my arm, soaking my clothes with blood.

His eyes showed panic, but he still defiantly said, "As long as you're leeching off my family, I won't let you have peace!"

Holding my bleeding arm, I felt utterly defeated. Seven years of close care only brought resentment and neglect from this father and son.
