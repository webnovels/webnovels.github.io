He beckoned me over as if he were calling a disobedient dog.

I remained still.

Declan Perry's face immediately showed impatience.

"Nora Taylor, you're smart. You should realize that leaving the Perry Family means you have nowhere to go."

"I've asked the secretary to buy you a dog with purer bloodlines and a more expensive bracelet."

"If you find Asher hard to manage, Luna can help you; she'll start living with you at the Perry Family from today."

Declan Perry watched me, seemingly waiting for me to accept joyfully, gratefully comply, and then take care of him and his son with Luna Foster.

But I didn't want that anymore.

"You decide, it has nothing to do with me anymore."

Luna Foster stepped out from behind Declan Perry.

"I know Miss Taylor doesn't welcome me, so I should leave."

"After all, someone like me without a status doesn't deserve to take care of Asher."

She pretended to cry, walking towards the door, but was stopped by Declan Perry after just a few steps.

"Status is just a matter of my decision. If you can get pregnant, I'll make you the real Mrs. Perry."

After casting me a glance, he picked Luna Foster up in his arms.

The villa door was kicked shut by him, and the maids and butler scurried away.

Asher Perry looked at me smugly.

"Aunt Luna is kind and gentle; only she deserves to be my mom."

Looking at this child I raised from a young age, I was shocked.

"Is that really what you think?"

"Yes! You evil woman, don't think I don't know. It was you who seduced my dad, causing my mom's death from difficult childbirth!"

"Sooner or later, I'll avenge my mom!"

I looked at the amulet on his chest and sighed.

Asher Perry was a premature baby, weak and often sick.

To ensure his healthy growth, I personally took care of his every need.

I even gave him the amulet my mom left me.

Seven years of countless days and nights of care and companionship couldn't compare to a few words from outsiders.

I reached for the amulet around Asher Perry's neck.

He instinctively raised his hand to block, "If you dare hit me, I'll have Dad kick you out!"

But I only took off the amulet from his neck.

"Asher Perry, you're already seven. Even if you don't understand some things now, you will in the future."

"I didn't raise you well; someone better will take care of you. As for us, we probably won't see each other again in this lifetime."

With Asher Perry looking at me in confusion, I headed to the airport with my luggage.

The Perry Family's old residence quickly faded, disappearing from my sight.

I knew that after I left, Declan Perry would bring in someone new to care for Asher Perry.

But none of that mattered to me anymore.

Having wasted thirty years, it's time I lived for myself.

Just as I was about to board the plane, a large hand reached from behind, snatching the ticket from my hand.

The cold, indifferent voice made me shudder.

"Nora Taylor, where do you think you're going?"
