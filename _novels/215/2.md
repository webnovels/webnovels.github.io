His tone was as calm as ever, yet it carried a hint of regret.

The smile on his lips vanished instantly.

The person he loves the most?

Why didn't he just say it was me?

My friend sitting next to me teased me with a playful expression:

"Susu, I never expected it. Your Professor Jiang seems so aloof, yet secretly he's so romantic, tattooing your XIN on his arm."

"Truly envious of your relationship."

Hearing her words, the gloom in my heart slightly lifted.

Looking at Asher's affectionate gaze on the tattoo on TV, a smile tugged at my lips.

Asher and I grew up together; we were childhood sweethearts.

Later, we got married as planned.

He's not one to express love openly, but it turns out he cared for me deeply in secret.

Thinking of this, my cheeks warmed slightly.

My hand unconsciously touched my belly.

After my friend left, I was alone in the villa.

I waited quietly for Asher to come.

Hoping to see his joy when he found out the news.

However, what I didn't expect was.

What I received was Asher's farewell letter.
