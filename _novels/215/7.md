When I woke up again.

I was standing in a secluded part of the campus woods, and not far away, Asher was walking towards me.

His gaze was cold when it landed on me.

I was reborn.

Realizing this.

This time, I turned and left without saying a word to Asher.

But after a few steps.

Suddenly, there was a rush of footsteps behind me.

Asher sprinted past me like the wind, his unsteady behavior unlike his usual self.

I watched his figure disappear, and a bold idea formed in my mind.

So I pursed my lips and followed.

He reached the classroom before me.

When I arrived, he was at the door, looking lost yet relieved as he watched Adeline quietly reading inside.

Sunlight fell on his face, giving him a subtle gentleness.

His gaze was so focused on Adeline.

On the woman he fell for at first sight and kept buried in his heart.

With just one glance, I understood.

Asher was reborn too.

Guided by memories from my previous life, I found my place.  

It's lunchtime now.  

The academic atmosphere at Central High School is very intense. Everyone studies at a brisk pace, with no time to waste.
