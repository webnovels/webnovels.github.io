How absurd.

All those years, I gave up inheriting Iris's Family, choosing to be an ordinary anesthesiologist for him.

I even repeatedly refused others' kindness, focusing only on him.

In the end, he ignored all my efforts.

His eyes only saw that girl from the slums, Adeline, who wasn't even worthy of him.

Every word in the farewell letter was like a burning ember, leaving my heart bleeding.

Asher betrayed my deep love, choosing to mentally drift away.

Such a scumbag doesn't deserve for me to endure the hardship of carrying his child for ten months.

Just as I made up my mind, the villa's doorbell suddenly rang.
