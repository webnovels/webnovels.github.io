Asher, a renowned professor of surgery at City Central Hospital, single-handedly completed a highly complex heart transplant.

During an interview, his composed demeanor, impressive background, and exceptional surgical skills instantly won him a multitude of admirers.

Yet, such an accomplished man couldn't escape questions about his personal life.

When the audience learned he was married, many single women watching showed visible disappointment.

But they were also curious about who could inspire such a remarkable man to settle down.

I sat on the sofa watching the live interview, feeling a sudden surge of secret joy.

The host noticed the tattoo on the inside of Asher's wrist—"XIN."

She asked about its meaning.

The moment she asked, Asher's composed face showed a slight hesitation.

His eyelids lowered, concealing the emotions swirling in his dark eyes.

"It's my beloved."
