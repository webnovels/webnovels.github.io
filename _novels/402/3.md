Vivian paused: “I…”

Julian quickly interjected: “Liam, please don’t compete with me. Noah is waiting for Vivian to save his life.”

Vivian let out a sigh of relief: “Liam, don’t be angry. I’m a doctor; my duty is to save lives and help those in need.”

“Wait for me, I’ll be there in a moment.”

With that, Vivian hurried away with Julian.

I watched their retreating backs and murmured, “No need, Vivian Hayes.”

I heard nurses discussing that Vivian had successfully matched for a kidney transplant and had already signed the donation agreement. She could have the transplant after a week of recovery.

Even though I already knew the outcome, my heart still twisted with a sharp, piercing pain.

After running around all day, I found an empty office to rest. As I entered, I walked in on Vivian and Julian, passionately kissing, completely lost in each other.

Seeing me, Vivian quickly pulled away from Julian and rushed to explain: “Liam, Noah is sick, I was just comforting Julian.”

I couldn’t help but sneer: “Comforting requires kissing each other?”

Vivian tried to explain further, but Julian, eyes red, pulled her back.

“Liam, don’t blame Vivian. I was the one who kissed her first.”

I scoffed mercilessly: “You must be starving to eat anything put in front of you.”

With that, I turned to leave. Vivian followed me out.

“Liam, please let me explain. I only see Julian as a brother.”

Julian’s hoarse voice came from behind:

“Vivian, the doctor said Noah’s condition is very dangerous. He needs a transplant immediately.”

Vivian hesitated for a moment, then explained to me: “I’ll donate my kidney to Noah first.”

She still left without a backward glance.

It was truly ironic. Her own son needed a liver transplant, and Vivian stayed far away.

Her childhood friend’s son needed a kidney transplant, and Vivian immediately volunteered to donate her kidney.

It was so clear then. Love and indifference, so starkly visible.

If only I had realized sooner, if only I hadn’t placed all my hope in Vivian, Arthur might still be alive.

In that moment, I completely gave up hope.

I went home to pack my bags. All of Arthur’s and my belongings, I packed them all away. If this was the end, then it had to be a clean break.

After packing everything and printing out the divorce papers, a faint glow appeared on the horizon.

The sun was rising. A new day had begun.

I walked into the first rays of morning light, leaving the home where Vivian and I had supposedly shared a decade of love.

As I hailed a cab, I opened my phone. Vivian’s messages flooded in, one after another.

“I’m donating my kidney to Noah tomorrow at 9 AM. Come early to take care of me.”

“Noah can’t drink or eat after surgery. Prepare some cotton swabs to moisten his throat later.”

“Don’t worry, once I recover, I’ll donate my liver to Arthur.”

“Once Arthur is better, let’s go on that world trip together. We’ll go to Switzerland to see the Northern Lights, ski in the Alps, experience all the breathtaking scenery across the globe.”

I closed the messages, letting out a bitter, self-deprecating laugh.

Vivian Hayes, we have no future.

At eight o’clock, I took Arthur’s body to the funeral home, but at the corner, I ran into Vivian.

“Liam, is this…?”

I looked at her coldly: “Vivian Hayes, Arthur passed away. His cremation is at noon. Do you want to come with me to say goodbye?”

Vivian stumbled back two steps.

“Impossible. How could that be?”

Julian steadied Vivian: “Liam, why do you keep cursing Arthur? Arthur is perfectly fine.”

Julian kept spouting nonsense, provoking me. I couldn’t help but slap him across the face.

Julian licked the blood from the corner of his mouth, looking at me defiantly: “Exposed, huh? Is Liam getting upset and resorting to violence?”

“Enough!”

Vivian snapped, and the noisy environment suddenly fell silent.

Vivian walked closer, step by step, staring at me fiercely: “Liam Walker, I just didn’t donate my liver to Arthur the way you demanded. Do you really need to lie to me?”

She abruptly overturned the gurney transporting Arthur’s body.

With a crash, Arthur’s small, frail body fell to the floor right in front of us.
