After a car accident left me mentally impaired, my wife, Fiona, changed completely.

Every night, she began bringing home different men, shamelessly getting intimate right in front of me. She even allowed these men to humiliate and beat me without resistance.

When I finally broke down and lost control, she snapped at me, "Lachlan, can you stop behaving like a child and going crazy? I'm a person too, I get tired, I need love, and I have my own needs! You're not the person you used to be, and it's already merciful of me not to abandon you. Do you expect me to remain loyal forever?"

What she didn't know was that when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, I willingly traded my intelligence for her health.

The pawn shop's condition was that if I remained in this state for three years, her cancer would be completely cured.

Now there are only three days left.

But I regret it.

I want back what I lost.
