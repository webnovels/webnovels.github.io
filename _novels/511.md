On my birthday, my wife Zoe, who had promised to spend the day with me, was nowhere to be found.

I waited from morning till night, asking everyone I knew, but no one had heard from her.

Just as I was about to call the police, I saw trending photos online of my adopted brother Leo passionately kissing Zoe.

Above them were dazzling, grand fireworks.

The headline read: "Evans Corp CEO Lavishes Millions on Adopted Brother - Sibling Love or Secret Affair?"

Leo even posted birthday celebration photos with Zoe on Instagram. There was a small cut on Zoe's lip.

The caption read: "I'll always love you, sis."

I commented: "Wishing you a lifetime of happiness together."

Immediately, I was bombarded with calls from Zoe:

"What do you mean by wishing us happiness? Leo and I are just siblings, don't be so jealous!"

"Leo's fictional skin condition* flared up on his birthday and he was suicidal. What's wrong with me keeping him company for a normal birthday? Do you want his birthday to become his deathday?"

"Leo saw your comment and thinks he's a homewrecker now. He's really upset. Delete it and apologize right now! Otherwise I'll divorce you!"

I coldly replied: "Fine, let's get divorced then."

*Note: "Skin hunger syndrome" is a fictional condition invented for this story, not a real medical diagnosis.
