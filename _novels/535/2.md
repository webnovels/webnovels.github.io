I didn’t know where I should go. When my thoughts returned, my spirit was already floating at the entrance of the villa. Before I even got close, I saw the vast golden flower sea—the entire area filled with sunflowers.

On the way here, I’d already heard so much about Julian. Everyone said he’d been searching for me all this time, desperate to salvage our relationship. 

People dismissed me as ungrateful, calling me cold and heartless. If I truly loved him, why would I disappear for a whole year, not even giving Julian a chance to change? But they didn’t know I’d waited for Julian for seven years, and loved him for seven years.

Julian claimed I loved sunflowers, so the media eagerly reported how he’d planted an entire field of them for me.

 This grand gesture, supposedly proof of his deep affection, actually reeked of insincerity. I didn't even like sunflowers. That field was just the last gift I'd left behind.

They even kept repeating the flower’s meaning: "silent love," pinning it onto Julian. His public display was so overwhelming that no one bothered to care about the small patch of flowers in the backyard that truly belonged to me.

Returning here after a year, I felt utterly lost. My hands passed right through the glass door, the lightness of my body once again reminding me of the grim reality of my death.

I saw many framed pictures on the living room wall, displaying the love letters I had written.

 That was the first time Julian ever questioned my sincerity. He didn't believe in love, and his friends looked down on me, a mute girl. 

They would jokingly ask if I was only with Julian for his money, their voices dripping with casual disdain.

My face flushed crimson, and I frantically signed my explanations, forgetting that these rich kids couldn't understand sign language. Julian never said a word, just stood there, watching the whole circus with a cold expression.

To prove myself, I wrote countless love letters, articulating my affection word by word.

 But these letters were eventually thrown to the floor during one of our arguments, dismissed as trash by Julian. 

He claimed he didn't believe those hollow words, sneering at my supposed insincerity. I cried, trying to pick up the scattered papers, unable to make a sound.

But now, red markings covered those letters. Every one of my sentences had a response—Julian’s belated confession. So, he had always known I was telling the truth. He had always paid attention to everything I did. But Julian always pushed me away, again and again, all for his ridiculous pride. He’d deny me countless times, saying hurtful things, only to beg me to come back later.

Because of Julian's attitude, everyone around him looked down on me too. They all thought I was the one relentlessly clinging to him, but they didn’t know Julian and I were each other's salvation. 

I loved the handsome boy from school, and he liked having me by his side. He’d pour out his heart to me, always standing up for me, always swearing he’d never let me suffer.

He’d even tried to learn sign language for me once. But as time wore on, he simply… forgot. Those precious memories, along with his willingness to learn, were abandoned somewhere along the way.
