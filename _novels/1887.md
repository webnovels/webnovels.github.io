I was filling out the discharge papers and paying the final hospital bill for my son’s born when a trending post flashed on my phone screen.
“A neighbor I’ve met twice is badgering me to babysit her newborn, but my own daughter just gave birth this week. I don't know how to refuse. Help me, internet.”
The comments section was a chaotic mix of suggestions, but the author only replied to the one that stood out as brilliant.
“Simple. Tell her you and your husband are retired and planning a grand, open-ended travel adventure. Move in with your daughter so the neighbor can’t track you down. You won't return until the baby is old enough for daycare.”
My eyes widened. Genius-level emotional intelligence. I thought, simultaneously shaking my head in judgment of the shameless neighbor. How can someone, after exchanging two polite nods, have the audacity to make such an absurd demand?
Thank God my mom, Eleanor, had agreed to watch my son, Theo. I’d be able to return to my high-pressure job at the firm immediately.
But when I opened the front door to my apartment, the silence hit me first. The place was empty.
I called my parents' home number and cell phones. No answer.
Two hours later, a text finally pinged from my mom.
“Jess, your dad and I decided to take advantage of our good health and hit the road for a while. We’re planning a big trip. We don’t have a return date yet, so I’m afraid I’ll have to put off helping with the baby. You’ll have to hold down the fort for now. You’re strong, honey.”
My arms, cradling the sleeping Theo, went stiff.
My thumb instinctively tapped the Instagram icon and opened the profile of my cousin, Briana.
Sure enough, she had posted an update.
The video showed my mother’s aging figure bustling in a gleaming, modern kitchen, cradling a pink, swaddled newborn. The caption read:
“A kid with a mom is a treasure! Thanks to my amazing Mama for easing the load. Love you a million times over! #GrandmaGoals #SupportSystem”


My eyes burned as I stared at the screen, reading the caption over and over in disbelief.
Then Theo, nestled in my arms, woke up and began to wail, a desperate, hungry cry that yanked me back to the cruel reality of my apartment.
The lights were off. The faucet was dry. The power and water had been cut off before I even came home—I couldn't even make his formula.
When I called my mom, the line rang for a full ten minutes before she picked up. Her voice was rushed and preoccupied.
“Hello? Jess? What is it? Why are you calling me right now? I’m right in the middle of something.”
I took a shaky breath, trying to keep my voice even.
“Mom, what was the meaning of that text? We agreed three days ago—I’d check out of the hospital, drop the baby off with you, and head straight back to the office. The partners are waiting for me to join the meeting. What am I supposed to do now?”
A two-second pause. Then, my mom’s tone dropped, hardening into the familiar, impenetrable wall of disapproval.
“Jessica Lynn, get this straight. I’m your mother, not some hired nanny.”
“I spent twenty-eight years raising you. It was exhausting. I finally retired, and I deserve to enjoy my life. And yes, I agreed to help, but I’m entitled to a little time to myself, aren't I? A break?”
Tears were blurring my vision. The answer to the trending forum post suddenly became horrifyingly clear.
I, her biological daughter, was the “neighbor she'd met twice.” And Briana, the cousin she was helping, was the one she truly considered a daughter. The Golden Ghost she’d chosen over me.
“How long until you’re back?” I whispered.
“I have no idea! I just got to the first stop on our itinerary, and you’ve already ruined my mood. Forget sightseeing today. I’m checking into the hotel to rest.”
My father, Robert, took the phone just in time.
“Jess, your mother’s going through The Change, don’t take it personally.” He paused, and I could hear him taking a deep breath. “But don’t blame your dad for saying this—you delay your mom’s mood one day, we slow our trip one day. It means we come home one day later.”
I understood. I was a nuisance, a burden that she even hated to hear on the phone.
Then, I heard Briana’s soft, concerned voice in the background.
“What’s wrong? Is Jess mad that you came to see me? Maybe I should call and apologize.”
My mom’s cold voice cut her off. “Don’t bother. I don’t need her permission to go wherever I please.”
“Rob, hang up. Don’t say anything else. Just hearing her voice is annoying. She sounds like a debt collector. Can’t she give us two days of peace?”
Before my dad could hang up, I blurted out the question that had been burning my throat.
“Dad, I thought you and Mom were traveling alone. Why does it sound like Briana is there, too?”
My father coughed awkwardly, clearly scrambling for an excuse.
“Oh, that… Well, Briana hasn’t been doing well. A bit of postpartum depression, you know. Your mother thought it would be good to bring her along for a change of scenery, a little vacation.”
“She hired a night nurse for the baby—a cheap one we found through an old connection. Since you didn’t want an outsider watching Theo, your mom didn’t mention it to you. Jess, don’t read too much into this, okay?”
He hung up.
I felt a bucket of ice water cascade over me, from my head down to my toes. Don't read too much into this, he’d said, yet they had just done the one thing guaranteed to make me question everything.
I knew this shift was coming the moment Briana moved in, eight years ago. Back then, I was too young to articulate the knot of fear and insecurity in my stomach, so I threw fits. I demanded the new designer backpack. I insisted on the pretty, limited-edition notebook. I needed them to agree, to show me I still mattered.
I got the backpack. The notebook is still tucked away in a drawer. But after that, my parents drifted further away.
They thought I was spoiled and immature. They told me I wasn't being a “proper older sister,” always failing to proactively look out for Briana. Whenever I cried, I was met with a lecture.
“You’re the older one, Briana is the little sister. You need to set an example. Look at you, sobbing like this—what will Briana think? She’ll think we’re abusing you.”
“Briana’s parents died tragically. Your dad and I had to take her in. She’s your sister now. You need to grow up and watch out for her when we’re not around.”
The day I cried the hardest, my mom lost her last thread of patience.
“Jess, look at yourself! What a scene! You’re supposed to be her big sister, yet you can’t even hold it together as well as she can! Briana lost both her parents and she didn’t cry like this! I am so disappointed in you!”
From that day on, all their attention, and all their affection, was poured into Briana.
I thought if I worked harder and gave them more money, their eyes would finally fall back on me. A seven-figure transfer was made. It didn't even buy a smile.
I knew then that some things couldn't be bought.
We both went through relationship crises. I got divorced; she broke up with her boyfriend. My parents immediately rushed to comfort her.
My consolation? A dismissive sigh.
“You bury yourself in work every day. What did he expect from a marriage with you? It’s not a surprise he left. The family’s broken, but hey, you can get back to work now. No one’s stopping you.”
Theo’s cry dragged me back to the present. I held him in one arm and fumbled for my utility payment card with the other. I put every ounce of my remaining postpartum strength into restoring the power and water.
The lights flickered on. The faucet sputtered to life.
I mixed his formula, and Theo quickly settled into sleep. After changing a diaper and washing the bottle, I was utterly exhausted. I grabbed my phone for a moment of peace.
And there it was: Briana’s latest video.
My mother was rocking Briana’s baby to sleep. Briana herself was seated on a sunny balcony, radiating a youthful glow, collagen practically spilling off the screen. My father appeared, offering a platter of washed, sliced fruit. Half the platter was imported cherries—the kind I couldn't afford for myself.
The caption: “Mom and Dad say I’ll always be eighteen in their eyes, always their little princess at home~”
I checked the anonymous forum post again. There was a new update from the author: “The advice worked like a charm! We’ve moved in with my daughter, and the annoying neighbor hasn't found us! So relieved!”
I looked around my apartment—the remnants of my home-birth, the boxes of baby gear, the overall messiness of a new mother’s life. A battlefield. A wave of bitterness washed over me.
I remembered the time I scored a huge deal on a box of cherries from an online market and brought them to my parents. I hadn't even tasted one.
They threw the box and me out before I could step fully inside.
“What’s the point of buying such expensive junk? Just give us the cash! This is all capitalist scheming. These are just overgrown cherries we grow ourselves!”
I was eight months pregnant that day. I knelt on the pavement, picking up the scattered fruit, and cried for three days until my eyes were swollen shut. Now, they were serving the exact same imported cherries to Briana.
I took a deep breath and texted my mom.
“Where are you guys traveling? I’m feeling really down. I’d like to join you for a change of scenery.”
The phone rang instantly.
“Jess, what are you talking about? We’ve been gone for days! You can’t just fly out here. There’s no direct route, and it would be a huge hassle. Mom wouldn't want you to suffer. Stay home. I’ll come back when I can.”
I gave a bitter laugh. “Is that right? How many places have you seen? You haven't posted anything—I thought you were still in the same place.”
My mother’s voice instantly became flustered. “I—I haven’t had time to edit the pictures! You know your dad’s terrible photography skills!”
“Don’t you believe me? I’ll send you proof.”
Three photos appeared seconds later. My heart sank further. The AI watermark from the photo-editing app was still clearly visible at the bottom of the photos. They had gone to so much trouble just to fool me.
“See, Jess? I’ve been so exhausted I haven’t even checked my phone. Traveling is draining.”
Before I could speak, she cut in quickly. “Gotta go, the bus is here. Your dad and I are getting on. The signal’s bad. Bye!”
The moment the line went dead, a notification popped up. Briana had sent me a screenshot of a transaction.
It was divided into three payments, totaling one hundred and thirty thousand dollars. The payment account was my parents' retirement fund card—a number I’d memorized over three years of monthly transfers.
“Thank you, Mom and Dad! I got it! I love you so much. When the baby is older, I’ll tell her she was raised under the love of her grandparents! ”
My finger twitched, my heart skipped a beat. Before I could reply, the message was recalled.
“Oops, sorry, Sis, wrong person.”
“You didn't see anything, did you?”
I didn’t reply. The screenshots kept flashing behind my eyes. One hundred thousand dollars was my life savings, the money I’d worked myself to the bone for. The other thirty thousand was their combined retirement savings.
They hadn't kept a single penny for themselves or spent any on me and my son. They had given it all to Briana.
In that instant, my heart felt like it was being sawed open by a blunt blade. The pain was so sharp it annihilated my reason.
If they chose to discard me so carelessly, then I didn’t owe them a damn thing.
I picked up my sleeping son and rushed downstairs, hailing a cab straight to Briana’s complex. It was a place I'd begged, pleaded, and pulled strings to secure after her breakup. It was a cheap rental—my parents had complained about the environment, and Briana refused to pay more for a better one.
Everything I had sacrificed for this family was now a stinging slap to my face, cutting to my very core.
The moment I stepped through the main gate, I ran straight into the three of them, carrying the baby out.
Briana performed a half-hearted protest. “Mom, you really shouldn’t travel this far. It’s too much work. My place is so small. It’s not nearly as comfortable as the house Jess bought you. I feel so bad watching you squeeze onto the sofa every night…”
My mother, who always demanded the highest living standards, quickly waved her off.
“Don’t be ridiculous! I’m your mother. Who else will care for you when you’re a single mom? You’re family. Don't be a stranger.”
Briana smiled sweetly. “But I could just hire a night nurse. There are plenty of affordable ones now.”
My mother pretended to be angry. “Hand my granddaughter over to a stranger? Are you trying to stop me from sleeping soundly?”
The next second, their laughter died. All three pairs of eyes fixed on my face.
“Sis? What are you doing here?”
“Jess? Why didn’t you call?”
“Jess, let Dad explain, it’s not what you think, your mother is—”
Panic flashed across my parents' faces. Only Briana’s eyes held a subtle, calculated triumph—as if she’d been expecting me all along.
I cut them off, my smile cold and cynical. “I found Briana this apartment. Can't I visit?”
“You said you hired a night nurse. I was worried. I figured, raising one baby is work, raising two isn’t much more. So I came to check in. I guess… I picked a bad time?”
My father’s explanation was choked in his throat.
My mom rushed to speak. “No, no, it’s not what you think.”
“Then what is it?”
“The nurse had a family emergency and had to take leave. I didn't want to worry you, so I thought I’d watch the baby for a couple of days before we set off on our trip. You know, so Briana could leave feeling relaxed…”
“Then what about the photos you sent me?”
My mother’s face flushed a deep, ugly red. This time, she was truly speechless. I looked her up and down. Everything she was wearing, except for her reading glasses, had been bought by me at a department store.
I couldn’t understand what I had done to deserve this. How I had failed them so completely that they would repay me like this. My palms were clenched so tight they were shaking, but with Theo strapped to me, I couldn’t even use my hands to vent my rage.
In the deadlock, Briana smiled and looped her arm through my mother’s.
“Well, Sis, it’s a sign! You’re here at the perfect moment. We were just about to leave.”
“Since you’re here, you might as well join us. I’ll call the Uber. Dad, go get the bags. Mom, you buy the ticket for Jess.”
My parents' eyes lit up simultaneously.
“Briana, you’re so thoughtful! Yes, that’s exactly what we’ll do.”
“That's exactly what I meant! I just couldn't put it into words. Jess, send Mom your ID number. I’ll buy your ticket.”
I lowered my eyes. “I already gave it to you. The day I checked into the hospital.”
My mother offered an awkward laugh. “Oh, right, I forgot. Getting old, losing my mind. You know how it is. Don't be mad.”
My dad went back inside for the luggage. My mom lowered her head to purchase the ticket. The payment screen failed three times.
My mom managed a weak smile. “Jess, could you transfer me some more spending money? The car fare isn't covered.”
“You have enough for three people, but not for me?”
My mom’s face immediately turned cold. “What kind of attitude is that? Our budget was set for three people. You’re the one who showed up uninvited!”
“Besides, I’m your mother! It’s your duty to pay for my vacation!”
I took a sharp, painful breath. My heart froze solid.
“I’ve transferred money to you every month for years, over a hundred thousand dollars total. This month, I’m on maternity leave. I don't have the high salary yet, and I don't have the money for you. Does that mean I don’t get to join the trip?”
“Where did that one hundred thousand go? Couldn't two thousand dollars of the money I gave you be spent on me?”
“Briana hasn’t worked a day since college. You pay her rent, you give her an allowance. How is it that when it comes to me, you have nothing left?”
“Just because I have a job, do I deserve to be bled dry by you?!”
My voice rose with each question. The answer was a sharp, stinging slap across my face.
“What are you saying?! I’m your mother! Is this how you speak to your elders?!”
Other tenants in the complex began to stop and stare. My mother, consumed by rage, lunged forward to hit me again. I shielded Theo with one arm and braced myself for the confrontation.
Briana stepped in, forcing a clumsy, tearful apology. “Please, Sis, stop this. Mom didn’t mean it.”
“You’re her daughter. Can’t you just swallow your pride? We’re all adults. Don’t make Mom angrier.”
I lifted my knee to support Theo and swung my free hand, delivering a sharp slap to Briana’s face.
“This is between my mother and me. Stay out of it.”
The next moment, Briana’s eyes turned crimson. She dropped to her knees in front of me and began slamming her forehead against the pavement.
“I’m sorry! I’m so sorry! I know I was wrong! I won’t talk to Mom and Dad anymore! I won’t let them help me! Please, don’t be angry. I’ll leave right now…”
Her forehead quickly began to bleed. The baby in her arms started to wail.
My mother stepped forward, placing herself squarely in front of Briana.
“How dare you! How dare you speak to my daughter like that!”
“I want to care for my daughter! What business is that of yours?!”
Someone in the crowd recognized them and immediately pulled out a phone to start a livestream. The comment section exploded.
“Wait, isn’t that the family being harassed by the shameless neighbor? What’s going on?”
“The psycho is actually the neighbor! She followed them here? How can a person be so thick-skinned? Can't she tell they don't want her around?”
“If I had a crazy person like that on my back, it would be her or me! That woman is far too kind!”
My father came down with the luggage and saw the scene. His eyes instantly turned red with fury. Without asking a single question, he rushed up and delivered a hard slap to my face.
“What did you say to my wife and daughter!”
“Get out! Get out now! You are not welcome here! Neither is the bastard child you had!”
The memory of my childhood flashed before my eyes. My father, spinning me in the air, perched on his shoulders.
“Daddy, will you always be nice to Jess? What if Jess gets too big? I won't be able to ride a plane!”
My father laughed as he spun. “Then our princess’s little princess will get to play! And your daddy will try to age slowly.”
The image shattered, replaced by my parents’ contorted, hate-filled faces. I held my screaming son tighter.
“Fine. I’ll go.”
“But when I walk out of here today, I will not be coming back.”
My father bent down, snatched a stone from the pavement, and hurled it at my back.
“Who needs you back! Don’t let me ever see you again!”
“Briana is my daughter! You’re just an ungrateful wretch we wasted our money on!”
The sharp edge of the stone tore through my blouse. Blood bloomed on my skin. Biting back a cry, I walked away, putting distance between myself and their hateful eyes.
Outside the complex, I hailed a cab straight to a real estate office.
I slapped the house deed onto the desk.
“Sell this house. Price doesn't matter. Just make it happen as fast as possible.”
If they didn’t consider me their daughter, they certainly wouldn't want to live in a house bought with my money.
After settling the terms, I contacted an attorney. Briana was not related to me. I had a strong case to sue her to reclaim my hundred thousand dollars.
Three days later, I learned from Briana’s social media that the three of them had returned from their “vacation.” They had their fill of being social media stars.
But when they stepped through the door of my parents' house, all three of them froze.
Immediately, my phone, a hundred miles away, began vibrating wildly.
