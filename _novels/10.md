A week before my wedding to Lucas Gray, his first love got divorced.
He brought her to me, asking to call off our engagement: "Vivian, I don't want to settle."
"No matter how hard you try to imitate her, you'll never measure up."
I calmly walked away, cut my long hair short, and put on my biker jacket.
I returned to my true battlefield.
He sneered to his friends: "Who would like such a wild woman? She's not marriage material at all."
Until a photo suddenly circulated in their circles.
In the picture, a delicate white hand rested on the chest of the most notorious young master in high society, who was straddling a motorcycle.
His tattooed, muscular arm wrapped tightly around the woman's waist.
The photo oozed with raw chemistry.
Lucas finally called: "Vivian, who is he?"
The reply came from another man's lazy voice: "Hey, ex-boyfriend. Let me introduce myself. I'm her lawful husband."
