Running my fingers along the sharp edges of the application, I left without hesitation and took a taxi to the company.

After packing all day, it was already evening.

I had submitted my application for an overseas assignment through the system a couple days ago and it had been approved. Now I just needed to submit the paper form for the records.

At the company, everyone was whispering and staring as I walked by.

"Isn't that the guy who crashed the CEO's daughter's wedding in that viral video? Didn't he take bereavement leave and disappear for a while? How dare he show his face here again?"

"I bet he's here to quit. He's been at the company for 10 years and is still just a team leader. I heard he applied for promotion five times and got rejected every time. What a loser."

These harsh comments used to really get me down, but now I felt nothing.

After all, I had heard far worse during the time I was arranging my mother's funeral.

I kept my eyes straight ahead and knocked on my boss Tom's office door.

"Come in," he called.

Tom nodded with satisfaction when he saw the form in my hand.

"Jack, when you told me a few days ago that you wanted an overseas assignment, I didn't believe it. You always refused before, saying you didn't want a long-distance relationship with your girlfriend. But this time you seem quite determined."

"The head office is sending someone to review the overseas assignments tomorrow. Come by the office again tomorrow to show your face, then you can leave."

"You know, we started as interns at the same time. You were always more capable than me and helped me out a lot. I'm glad you've finally decided to spread your wings..."

I lowered my eyes.

It's true, perhaps it was just bad luck, but all the interns who started with me had become executives while I remained stagnant.

Leaving the company, I looked back at the skyscraper where I had worked for the past decade.

In those ten years, Olivia's family company had grown stronger and stronger. Even their branch office buildings now reached into the clouds.

But why had my relationship with Olivia crumbled so completely?

My meeting with Olivia was the typical story of a poor student and a rich heiress.

My father died when I was young, leaving my mother to raise me alone.

Back then, I spent every spare minute outside of class working part-time jobs and tutoring to make ends meet.

Until one day, when a thug not only refused to pay me for tutoring, but brought his buddies to try and take what little money I had.

In my moment of despair, Olivia came to my rescue with her bodyguards. She helped me up off the ground and offered to treat me to a meal.

She said her grades were bad and she was afraid of failing, so she wanted me to help her cram for finals.

Of course, I knew her grades were actually excellent. This was just her way of helping me out.

I was drawn to her kindness and outgoing nature, and we gradually grew closer.

The day she confessed her feelings, she held my hand and proudly announced to everyone on campus:

"This is my genius boyfriend!"

When we graduated, I gave up the opportunity for a fully-funded overseas graduate program.

When I started working, I turned down a high-paying executive job offer from a major international company.

I only wanted to stay by Olivia's side, with the simple hope of marrying her, having children, and growing old together.

Until a year ago, when Olivia's childhood friend Ethan returned from abroad. Everything changed after that.

For the first time, Olivia abandoned me when I was sick, just to pick up Ethan from the airport.

That night she got completely drunk at his welcome party. Lying in Ethan's arms and refusing to leave with me, she cried:

"Ethan, why did you take so long to come back?"

From then on, Ethan became a constant source of arguments between us.

I wanted her to maintain some boundaries, but she accused me of being too controlling and not letting her have any friends.

She even sarcastically pointed out that she had known Ethan since childhood, while I was the newcomer.

Then two months ago, the day Ethan sent her a wedding invitation, Olivia suddenly leaned against me and mumbled:

"Jack, why don't we get married too?"

This was after rejecting my proposals 99 times.

Shaking my head to clear the memories, I found my shadow stretched long and lonely in the setting sun.

In this world, I no longer had any family left.

After walking a few steps, night had fully fallen.

I was about to take out my phone to call a taxi home when I heard a familiar laugh nearby:

"Ethan, put me down! If you drop me, you're dead!"

Turning my head, I saw the entrance of a brightly-lit bar.

Ethan was spinning in circles while carrying Olivia in his arms.

Olivia had her arms tightly wrapped around Ethan's neck, laughing with pure joy.

A crowd of people surrounded them, cheering them on.

"Keep going! Three more spins to go! Don't forget to drink from the same glass when you stop, Ethan!"

"Now that's true love! No wonder our little princess Olivia can't get over our Prince Ethan!"

When Ethan finally set her down, Olivia was a bit dizzy but smoothly took the glass someone handed her. She and Ethan linked arms and drank together like it was the most natural thing in the world.

The crowd's cheers grew even louder as they chanted:

"Kiss! Kiss!"

Olivia hesitated for a moment, not moving.

Ethan smiled and tried to defuse the situation:

"Alright, alright. You've been teasing us about the honeymoon all day. My wife has been a good sport, playing along since lunchtime. Time for everyone to head home!"

But the next second, Olivia grabbed Ethan's tie and pulled him down for a kiss.

Her eyes were open, gaze clear and tender.

A moment later, she looked away and slowly released Ethan's tie. Holding her head, she pretended to be drunk:

"I want to go home... my head hurts..."

I witnessed every bit of Olivia's care and cautious love for Ethan.

I also watched as she swayed and took out her phone to make a call.

Then, my phone started ringing.

From just a few meters away.

When Olivia heard the ringtone, our eyes met and she instantly straightened up.
