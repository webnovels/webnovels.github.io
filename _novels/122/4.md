I looked at the ceramic rings by my feet in confusion.

Behind me, Olivia cried out in an aggrieved tone:

"I had these rings custom made for us abroad! I was always thinking of you. Jack, why are you being so difficult? Why are you running away from home?"

I could only laugh.

I don't know what she was thinking.

The inside of the rings were engraved with "O&E" - clearly meant for Olivia and Ethan as a couple.

Yet she had the nerve to claim they were made specially for me.

I didn't stop walking, just checked into a hotel for the night.

I was leaving this city tomorrow anyway.

In the morning, I got ready and went to the office.

But as soon as I entered, I heard a chorus of praise.

"Wow, Ms. Johnson and Mr. Parker, you two make such a perfect couple! Even wearing matching outfits. I'm swooning!"

"Ms. Johnson, Mr. Parker, I'm a huge fan of you two. Could I get a photo please?"

Olivia and Ethan were arm-in-arm in the center of the office, basking in everyone's adoration. My boss Tom was bowing and scraping with a fawning smile.

So they were the representatives from headquarters.

Seeing me, Tom introduced:

"Jack, this is our CEO Ms. Johnson from headquarters, and VP Mr. Parker. They're here to review the overseas assignments."

Olivia deliberately turned away without looking at me, her previously upturned lips now a flat line as she asked coldly:

"Who all is going on overseas assignment this time?"

Tom pulled out my file along with two others, smiling:

"These three."

Olivia's expression instantly froze, her eyes filling with inky darkness.

Ethan's eyes flashed with schadenfreude as he quickly jumped in, feigning shock:

"How are you running things here? Don't you know our company strictly forbids married employees with children from taking overseas assignments? Both the applicant and approver will be punished!"

Tom looked bewildered as he stammered:

"But none of them are married..."

Olivia's delicate brows furrowed as she pointed at me, her red lips curving coldly:

"Didn't this person take marriage leave recently?"

Tom answered honestly:

"He did request marriage leave at first, but it seems there was a mistake. He changed it to bereavement leave later. His mother passed away."

Hearing this, the color drained from Olivia's face. Her outstretched finger froze as she stared at me in disbelief.

As if suddenly remembering something, her gaze flickered as she asked in a low voice:

"Why didn't you tell me... about your mother's death..."

I found it laughable.

My mom had always thought highly of Olivia as a daughter-in-law. She said I was blessed beyond measure to marry Olivia and had been eagerly waiting for the day Olivia would call her "Mom."

But what my mom got instead was Olivia marrying someone else and affectionately calling another woman "Mom."

I replied flatly:

"There was no need, Ms. Johnson. Does headquarters really concern itself with the family affairs of ordinary employees?"

Olivia seemed to sense things spiraling out of control. She gritted her teeth, anger flaring up:

"What do you mean no need? I'm her daughter-in-law after all!"

"Whose daughter-in-law are you?"

As everyone looked on in shock, the company doors swung open.

An older woman walked in, the fine lines around her eyes radiating sharpness.

Olivia's mother, the true power behind Johnson Corp - Mrs. Johnson.

Everyone snapped to attention, calling out in unison:

"Madam Chairwoman!"

Mrs. Johnson nodded slightly. She turned to Ethan with a smile, asking:

"Ethan, I sent you two newlyweds to make an appearance at the branch offices. What's going on here?"

Remembering Olivia's earlier outburst, everyone held their breath, not daring to make a sound.

Ethan's face cycled through shades of green and white before he forced a smile:

"Olivia's friend is Jack's wife. When she heard Jack was being sent overseas, Olivia wanted to speak up for her friend."

Hearing this, Olivia bit her lip and stayed silent, head bowed in conflict.

Mrs. Johnson's eyes flashed dangerously as she demanded:

"Who dares to violate company policy? I want to see who's so bold!"

I spoke up calmly:

"Madam Chairwoman, there's been a misunderstanding. I'm not married. My ex-girlfriend and I broke up amicably a while ago."

Mrs. Johnson raised an eyebrow, looking me up and down before turning to Olivia:

"I've seen Jack's file. He is indeed single. Olivia, are you mistaken? He's flying out for his assignment today. Don't delay him."

Flying out?

Olivia's pupils suddenly constricted.

She turned to see my calm expression and her heart skipped a beat.

A panicked look flashed across her face as she blurted out:

"Mom! It's not a friend, it's me! I'm Jack's wife! How could I be mistaken? We got our marriage license on November 3rd. He must be lying. I was there with him that day!"

Everyone in the office swallowed hard, not expecting to witness this kind of family drama.

Olivia relaxed a bit, thinking this would be enough to prevent me from leaving.

Mrs. Johnson's brow furrowed even deeper as her gaze moved between Olivia and me. After a moment, she pronounced her judgment:

"What nonsense are you spouting? Even if he was your ex-boyfriend, your household registration book has been safely in my possession this whole time. What did you use to get a marriage license?"
