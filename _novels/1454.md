I heard that the girl Kamran Thorne was interested in this time had been with her struggling boyfriend for years.

Kamran was relentless in pursuing her, taking what he wanted, by force if necessary, no matter the consequences.

The girl fought back like a cornered Monster, refusing to yield, even if it meant her ruin.

The night he finally got her, fireworks burst over the ocean, blooming for them all night long.

The next day, expensive jewelry and lavish gifts flooded her home, as if money were no object.

My friends told me all this when they came to the mental hospital to drop off my clothes.

I coughed up a mouthful of blood, then suddenly passed out.

When I woke up, Kamran, whom I hadn't seen in six months, stood by my hospital bed, giving me a warning.

"Angela, as long as you promise not to bother her, I can let you come home and enjoy all the privileges you deserve as Mrs. Thorne."

Finally, I nodded weakly in agreement.

Because just before I collapsed, I'd learned my brother Nealon had lost everything in an investment last month, saddled with massive debt.

Only with Kamran's financial support had Nealon avoided ruin.

It's just cheating, isn't it?

For Nealon's sake, I wouldn't make a fuss anymore.
