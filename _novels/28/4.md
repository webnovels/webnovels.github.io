I hurriedly opened the door and saw someone who shouldn't be there.
Gideon was there, holding a sobbing Fiona, comforting her.
"It's okay, it's okay. We've done this so many times, and nothing happened, right?"
Their clothes were disheveled, Fiona's bra hanging loosely.
I didn't understand their cryptic talk and rushed to push them aside, looking at Daphne on the couch.
She was foaming at the mouth, unconscious.
Panic overwhelmed me, and I went to call 911, but Fiona stopped me.
"No, you can't."
I looked at her awkward expression and shouted.
"Are you crazy? Daphne is your daughter too, how can you just let her die?!"
Fiona couldn't hide it anymore and confessed everything.
It turns out they found Daphne noisy, so they gave her too many prescription meds. It wasn't the first time, but this time Gideon gave the wrong medicine, causing an allergic reaction.
Fiona grabbed my hand, gritting her teeth.
"If anyone finds out I stole prescription meds, I'll lose my job, and Gideon will go to jail."
She almost begged.
"I'm a doctor. I know Daphne's condition, she just needs some meds."
"You're the boss, you have money, can't you find a shady clinic for her? Don't let anyone know."
I looked at Fiona in silence.
She knew she was a doctor. Daphne is only four, and many prescription drugs have strong side effects even for adults, let alone a four-year-old.
My heart turned cold, and any last bit of love for Fiona vanished with her words.
Even in the wild, animals protect their young, yet she would risk Daphne's life to save herself and Gideon.
Compared to the panicked Fiona, Gideon was calm.
He seemed sure I would help Fiona.
"Jude, stop wasting time. Hurry and find a hospital to take her."
"Don't let her die here, it's bad luck."
He looked at Daphne with disgust, as if she was a piece of garbage he could toss anytime.
I couldn't take it anymore and punched Gideon to the ground.
Then pointed at Fiona, speaking clearly.
"Fiona, we're completely over."
