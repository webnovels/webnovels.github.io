On the day we were supposed to get married at the courthouse, my boyfriend Samuel Lee had someone kick me out and brought in Rachel, his childhood sweetheart.

He looked at me nonchalantly and said, "Rachel's child needs legal custody. After we divorce, I'll marry you."

Everyone thought that I, being so in love with him, would willingly wait another month for him. After all, I had already waited for him for seven years.

But that very night, I accepted my family's arrangement for an international marriage and disappeared from his world.

Three years later, I accompanied my husband back to the country for ancestor worship. My husband had some urgent business, so he arranged for the local branch company to pick me up.

Unexpectedly, I ran into Samuel Lee, whom I hadn't seen in three years.

"You've made enough of a fuss. Come back... Rachel's child is about to start kindergarten. You'll be responsible for picking him up and dropping him off."
