The assistant looked at me, speaking with resignation.

"Madam, you've already ordered Mr. Nolan to be hit, and the impact was enough to cripple his legs.

 But why have the perpetrator repeatedly run him over, leaving his legs as nothing but mangled flesh, necessitating amputation?"

Fiona's eyes were cold, her tone indifferent.

"I did it to ensure nothing could go wrong. What if those people didn't cripple him? Nolan has always been exceptionally capable. 

It's not impossible for him to find renowned doctors across the United States to heal those legs."

"With his legs amputated, he'll forever be disabled. He's always been proud and ambitious, living a lifetime in the pain of broken legs, and won't think of fighting Jasper for the inheritance."

The assistant's pupils contracted, his gaze falling on my bandaged, severed legs.

"But what if Mr. Nolan finds out? You were at the scene of the accident too. What if he saw you, even the ambulance was called by a passerby. What if he blames you for life?"

Fiona took a step closer, her slender hand caressing the wound on my forehead.

"Then make sure he doesn't remember what happened that night. Aren't there drugs in those shady clinics that can interfere with memory?"

"Use them on him. If he can forget, great. If not, increase the dosage so he can't even remember who he is."

The assistant couldn't bear it, his voice trembling.

"Those drugs exist, but they're untested in clinical trials. They might cause permanent cognitive impairment, and severe cases could lead to incontinence, turning him into a vegetable..."

Hearing the assistant's words, Fiona showed impatience. Her eyes flared with anger.

"So what? Sacrificing him for Jasper's career is worth it."

"Since Jasper saved me from the fire five years ago, I haven't been able to love anyone else. If not for the family marriage, why would I marry Nolan?"

"If Jasper hadn't risked his life to save me back then, I might have died in that fire. Now the opportunity has finally come; I can repay Jasper."

I clenched my wrist tightly, oblivious to the blood from my palm. The wife who had been with me for five years seemed like a stranger.

Five years ago, I risked my life to save Fiona. The burn scar below my collarbone is still there. During our five-year marriage, I never mentioned it. 

I thought she knew I was the one who saved her because she agreed to the arranged marriage without hesitation. I never brought it up, fearing it would trigger painful memories for her. 

I never imagined she considered Jasper her savior all along.

The assistant handed her a necklace, his fingers trembling.

"This was tightly clutched in Mr. Nolan's hand during the car accident. His secretary said it was supposed to be your birthday gift."

Fiona stared at the blood-stained necklace, dazed for a few seconds. It was something I had specially acquired from an auction in Italy. 

Just because she said she liked it, I went to great lengths to get it, just to see her smile. At the moment of the accident, she was all I thought about.

She rubbed the necklace with her fingertips, her other hand caressing my face.

"As long as he's obedient and doesn't fight, I'll stay with him forever. He'll still be my Mr. Nolan, and I'll still be his Mrs. Nolan."

"Oh, and Jasper just took the heir position. We should celebrate. Help me give him the family heirloom ring."

The assistant's eyes widened, his tone more forceful.

"But that's Fiona's family heirloom ring. It's supposed to be for Mr. Nolan, your husband. How can you give it to—"

Fiona immediately interrupted the assistant.

"Don't say so much nonsense. Hurry up, Jasper deserves something so good."

Her words cut like a knife, causing me deep pain.

Over these five years, Fiona, have you not loved me at all?
