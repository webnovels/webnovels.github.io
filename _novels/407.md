To amuse his new mistress, Damon ordered me, pregnant and exhausted, to dance in the water for his entertainment.

When I finally dragged myself out, gasping for air, his mistress took one look at me and started gagging.

"Your Majesty, I’m with child. I can’t stand the smell of fish."

It was only because I was a Merfolk princess that my legs transformed into a shimmering tail in the water.

Damon exploded with rage. He had me locked in a crystal cage and sunk deep underwater, forbidding anyone from opening it without his permission.

"Even if you can become human, you can’t hide that disgusting fishy scent! It's revolting!"

No matter how I struggled or pleaded, he didn’t care. He and his mistress even found it amusing.

And so, I drowned, my body eventually dissipating into the water.

He didn't know that while we Merfolk can breathe underwater, we must reside on land to bear our young.

After a full day and night, he finally seemed satisfied with my punishment and ordered me released.

But I could no longer surface.
