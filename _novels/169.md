After Dad declared bankruptcy, Mom started to demand a divorce.

I stayed out of it, watching as my sister shoved me aside and ran to Dad, saying:

"Dad, don't be sad. I'll stay with you!"

In my previous life, after our parents divorced, my sister went with our wealthy Mom while I stayed with our bankrupt Dad.

But then Mom remarried a jerk, lost everything, and ended up with nothing.

My sister suffered too.

Meanwhile, Dad's business flourished, and he became a tycoon.

Jealous of my success, my sister arranged a reunion that resulted in my fatal car accident.

Now, we've been transported back to the day our parents finalized their divorce at City Hall.

This time, with a smirk, my sister declared, "I love Dad, I want to stay with him."

Little did she know, I was even happier inside.

I refuse to live that life of hiding and dodging again!
