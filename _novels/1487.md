I was on my knees scrubbing the floor when suddenly my employer's son wrapped his arms around me from behind. "Melody, you smell so good."

I struggled, but he pushed me down onto the floor in one swift motion, pressing his lips against mine, gently licking and nibbling. I felt my entire body catch fire.

His hands roamed over my body, sliding slowly down from my chest...


My name is Melody, and I only started working as a housekeeper for the Hartley family last month.

If my family didn't desperately need money, I never would have agreed to work here.

A friend referred me to this job.

The reason I was so reluctant was because all the housekeepers at the Hartley residence have to wear maid outfits.

These maid outfits are incredibly revealing, made from thin, flimsy material. The skirt barely covers my ass.

Every time I kneel down to scrub the floor, the skirt rides up completely. My panties are totally exposed.

And with my 36D chest, these thin outfits can barely contain me.

Every time I move, they bounce and jiggle.

But honestly, the pay is incredible—$30,000 a month.

I couldn't resist that kind of money. My mother-in-law's illness requires constant funding, and normal housekeepers only make about $3,000 a month at most.

My mother-in-law's hospital stay costs money every single day. My husband's income alone can't cover it.

I haven't dared tell him what this housekeeping job actually involves. I just said the employer is wealthy and doesn't care about money, and that they pay well when I perform my duties properly.

I've been here over a month and haven't even met my actual employer yet. But I see the employer's son, Dominic, every single day.
