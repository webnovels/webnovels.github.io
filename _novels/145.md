I had been loved and hated by my husband for five years.

After our seventh breakup, he flaunted his new girlfriend at various high-profile events.

I didn't cry or make a scene. I just calmly observed the girl's face, which was 90% similar to mine before the accident.

The first breakup happened because that girl's eyes resembled mine.

The second breakup was due to her mouth being similar to mine.

The third was because of her figure.

I understood him.

Gabriel was a perfectionist. He spent five whole years trying to recreate the pre-accident version of me.

And this was the seventh time.

He had managed to piece together my pre-accident appearance, but he could never piece together my shattered heart.

I didn't wait for Gabriel's seventh attempt at reconciliation. I quietly disappeared from his world.

But later, he knelt in a crowded square, begging me to give him one more chance.
