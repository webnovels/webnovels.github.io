My husband's mistress was dead - murdered. That afternoon, my husband and I were taken to the police station.

I actually had no idea my husband was having an affair. If it weren't for this murder case, I might have been kept in the dark forever.

To identify the killer, the police took our fingerprints and asked about our whereabouts during the victim's estimated time of death.

The victim, Mandy Liu, was a 28-year-old office worker. She died around 11 PM on July 30, 2019. The cause of death was a severed carotid artery, leading to massive blood loss.

It had been three days since Mandy Liu's death.
