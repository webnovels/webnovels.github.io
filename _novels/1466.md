My best friend and I married brothers from the same family, and we ended up pregnant around the same time.

I married Julian, the brother who’s a doctor, and she married Leo, his good-looking police officer brother.

On our first wedding anniversary, my best friend and I were on our way to pick up our prenatal checkup reports when we got into a car crash.

My best friend escaped injury because she’d gotten out of the car earlier to buy me some milk, but I suffered severe bleeding.

Shaking, I called my husband, the doctor.

Julian sounded annoyed and said, "You’re lying again, just trying to get my attention! Medical resources aren’t something you can waste like this! Serena cut her hand, and I’m busy bandaging it. Stop bothering me!"

My best friend quickly called her husband, the police officer.

But Leo snapped, "Do you know what happens if you file a false police report? I’ve got to fix Serena’s leaky water pipe. Don’t waste my time!"

My best friend, eight months pregnant, dragged me to the hospital.

We both miscarried.

When I woke up, I looked at Mia’s pale face, and we exchanged bitter smiles.

"Chloe, I’m getting a divorce," she said.

"Me too," I replied.
