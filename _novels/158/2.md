When I woke up,

Sophia was sitting by my bedside, which was rare.

She looked down at me condescendingly, handing me a plastic bag with obvious disgust.

The wounds on my body were still aching faintly.

I lowered my head to look - it was full of fragments of the jade bracelet.

I was somewhat surprised that Sophia hadn't thrown them away.

"It was Jack who begged me not to throw them away. If only you were half as sensible as him."

I rummaged through the fragments, but my heart suddenly plummeted.

These were clearly just replaced fakes.

I pulled out the IV needle expressionlessly.

Jack suddenly appeared in the doorway, speaking slowly and deliberately: "Mr. Wilson, I've already returned your mother's jade bracelet intact."

He enunciated each word, a flash of provocation passing through his eyes.

Ever since he had entered the house, Jack had found me, the bodyguard, disagreeable in every way.

When hungry, he'd make me brave pouring rain to buy roast duck 50 kilometers away.

When the mood struck, he'd drag me out in the middle of the night to buy condoms for them.

Time and again he tried to destroy the last heirloom from my mother, just to force me to give up and leave.

I didn't understand. Wasn't Sophia completely devoted to him?

I was just a dog for Sophia to torment and train as she pleased.

Why did he want to destroy the last fantasy my mom left me?

All the anger surged to my head.

Ignoring the lingering pain in my body, I grabbed the fruit knife from the table.

I pressed it hard against Jack's throat, my voice ice cold.

"Give me back all those fragments!"

Jack cried like a frightened rabbit: "Sophia, I'm scared..."

Without Jack saying more,

The next second, I felt my scalp being forcefully yanked.

The small knife in my hand uncontrollably cut Jack's shoulder.

Tiny beads of blood appeared.

I was forced to look up at Sophia.

But I met a pair of extremely cold eyes.

In them was undisguised disgust, and a flash of murderous intent.

She laughed coldly and stabbed the fruit knife into my chest.

"Although you're my husband, don't forget who saved you back then! Do you want to experience being bitten by a lion again?!"

"Squelch!"

Blood instantly gushed out!

My pupils constricted, and I instinctively tried to pull out her hand, but she pressed down hard.

"Don't move... it'll be over soon."

I was in so much pain that the veins on my forehead bulged.

The woman's tone was rarely comforting.

Enduring the pain, I looked at Sophia with an extremely calm gaze.

At this moment, a strange sense of irritation suddenly welled up in Sophia's heart.

She slowly carved out that piece of flesh.

Blood flowed down my chest, staining my trouser legs red, and also staining her hands red.

Sophia looked at the words on my chest with satisfaction -

"Sophia Evans".

Just because I accidentally cut Jack,

Sophia personally carved a retaliatory tattoo on my body.

She casually tossed the fruit knife on the ground.

Sophia carefully embraced Jack, her tone pampering:

"It's okay, I'm here. I won't let you have even a tiny scar."

Jack immediately kissed her lips shyly, his face full of guilt:

"This was a gift from you. Luckily we found it. But I wrongly accused Mr. Wilson. Should I apologize to him?"

In front of everyone, looking at me covered in blood stains,

Sophia's voice was utterly cold.

"No need. He's just a bodyguard, a dog I keep. What's the big deal about suffering a little grievance?"

They started kissing deeply right in front of me, as if no one else was there.

But over these three years, I had already heard countless such sounds of debauchery.

My phone vibrated.

I couldn't help but smile.

My contract had completely fallen into her hands.

The flight ticket Sophia had cancelled was rebooked.

While kissing Jack passionately, Sophia discreetly observed me out of the corner of her eye.

Seeing the smile on my face that she hadn't seen in a long time,

The irritation in her chest inexplicably surged up again.

Before entering the bedroom, she coldly commanded: "I'm throwing Jack a birthday party tomorrow. You better show up too!"

Taking advantage of the sounds of lovemaking coming from the bedroom,

I quickly searched the entire villa.

I finally found those jade bracelet fragments.

Carefully gluing the pieces back into a bracelet shape.

I hugged it to my chest, having lost and regained it.

Tomorrow, I will leave with you.
