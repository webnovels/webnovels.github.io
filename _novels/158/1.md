The iron cage opened, and the massive lion roared as it charged out.

I faced it bare-handed, instantly knocked to the ground!

On the platform above, Sophia clenched her fists tightly.

Jack's face was flushed, his eyes sparkling.

Sophia's brow relaxed. It seemed they were telling the truth.

This really could cleanse Ryan's bad luck.

The lion slammed into me, and I felt like my internal organs had shattered.

I countered with a punch to the lion's eye.

The crowd gasped.

I was covered in blood but never backed down.

After accurately grabbing the nearby hunting rifle, I precisely shot the lion's throat.

One shot killed it. At the cost of 6 broken ribs and being mauled bloody by the lion.

I had won.

I successfully reclaimed my mother's heirloom.

Just as I was about to exit the underground arena,

Ryan suddenly turned pale and coughed heavily.

Sophia's eyes instantly changed. She snatched the heirloom I had fought so hard to retrieve from my arms.

The jade bracelet was viciously smashed, shattering into pieces.

Sophia frowned slightly, her eyes filled with disgust as she looked at me.

"Are you satisfied now that you've hurt Jack so much for a mere bracelet?"

I opened my mouth but was left speechless.

When Ryan choked on some water, Sophia splashed black dog blood on the heirloom.

He coughed once, and Sophia used the heirloom to force me to fight the lion.

My ribs were broken in six places, and my body wouldn't stop bleeding.

I didn't understand who was really hurting whom.

My nails dug deep into my palms.

I skillfully knelt down and kowtowed to her.

"I'm sorry, Miss. Please forgive me."

I bent down with difficulty, cherishing the fragments in my arms beyond measure.

Mom, this time, I will take you away.

The kneeling motion caused my shirt to be stained with fresh blood again.

Sophia's pupils constricted, and her brow twitched violently.

She unexpectedly helped me up.

"As long as you don't oppose Jack, I'll let you stay by my side and earn your keep."

Her tone was condescending, as if it were a great honor.

As she finished speaking, Jack suddenly fainted without warning.

Sophia's face instantly tensed. Jack's lackey quietly reported,

"Miss Evans, it might be the negative energy from a dead person's belongings that's making Mr. Parker feel unwell repeatedly."

I looked up.

A flash of triumphant joy quickly passed through Jack's tightly closed eyes.

He gripped Sophia's hand tightly and said understandingly: "Sophia, I'm fine. After all, this is Mr. Wilson's mother's heirloom. I can endure it."

Sophia stroked Jack's cheek lovingly and calmly ordered me.

"Throw away that disgusting thing. If it makes Jack feel unwell again, you can get lost too."

I looked at her indifferently and resolutely walked towards the door.

Seeing my lack of reaction, Sophia's chest visibly heaved.

She ordered someone to bring a whip and sneered.

"Even a dog dares to defy its master. A beating will do."

The whip fell like raindrops, each lash accompanied by a sharp whistling sound.

The wounds already torn open by the lion's fangs now bled even more profusely.

The force of the blows on my body lessened slightly, and Sophia mocked,

"It seems I've really been too indulgent with you. Now you don't even know how to beg for mercy?"

Every pain on my body reminded me.

Constant retreat would only make her more aggressive.

I bit my lip hard, clutching the fragments tightly in my arms, not letting myself cry out.

Sophia's breath caught, and the whip she wielded showed no mercy.

The whipping continued for a long time. The smell of blood from the lion's corpse stimulated my blurring consciousness.

Before losing consciousness,

I vaguely heard Sophia's cold laughter.

Her fingers casually swiped across my phone screen.

"A dog wanting to book a flight to run away from home? Just break its legs."

"Mere 99 lashes, just use some medicine to keep it barely alive."

"Oh right, quickly check on Jack. His health isn't good, remember to give him the best medicine."

I involuntarily passed out.

My mind couldn't stop thinking.

Now I'll miss the flight.
