The birthday party Sophia had meticulously prepared began promptly at 8 PM.

Jack, wearing a pure black custom-tailored suit, made a striking entrance arm-in-arm with Sophia.

The guests pushed me aside, quietly discussing among themselves.

"Mr. Parker is truly talented. No wonder Miss Evans has doted on you so much all these years."

"But I thought that bodyguard was Miss Evans' lawful husband?"

Sophia looked at me, rarely dressed formally, her tone carrying a hint of tenderness: "Introduce yourself to everyone."

There was a trace of expectation hidden in her voice that even she hadn't noticed.

I kept my head down, my tone neither servile nor overbearing.

"I am Sophia Evans' bodyguard - Jack Wilson."

Sophia was visibly stunned for several seconds, her expression visibly darkening.

An expression of annoyance flashed across my face.

What did she want me to do?

Jack smiled generously, a flash of malice in his eyes as he beckoned to me.

"I'm not feeling well today and can't drink. You drink all this alcohol for me."

I remained silent, finally opening my mouth.

"I'm allergic to alcohol..."

"Sophia, I know Mr. Wilson is probably still angry with me, so he's just making up this lie."

Jack hung his head, his voice filled with disappointment.

Sophia glanced at me, her voice growing heavier: "Drink! Don't you always carry allergy medicine? Take it before drinking, what could happen?"

Her tone left no room for refusal.

I silently took out the medicine and swallowed a few pills.

Soon, a group of people came forward with wine glasses to make small talk. I also picked up a glass and poured it down my throat.

Glass after glass, my stomach churned violently, unable to stop the urge to vomit.

The wounds that had not yet healed burst open under the effects of the alcohol.

Seeing the blood at the corner of my mouth, Sophia very obviously took a sharp breath.

The next second, Jack let out a scream.

"Sophia, the heirloom watch you gave me is missing. Jack was the only one near us just now, could it be that he..."

My pupils constricted, not because of this baseless accusation, but because the heirloom gift my mother had given to Sophia as a daughter-in-law,

She had casually given away without any burden on her conscience.

Back then, she had been so good to me and my mother.

At this moment, I couldn't help but laugh self-mockingly.

Sophia looked at my smile, and the familiar feeling of irritation surged up in her heart once again.

She personally comforted Jack and sternly called for the security guards.

The next second, several guards pinned me to the ground, forcefully tearing at my clothes.

Normally, I wouldn't have been so powerless to resist.

But with the new wounds Sophia had inflicted over the past two days, my body simply hadn't had time to recover.

I struggled desperately, but couldn't overcome their brute force.

My shirt was torn to shreds, the tattoo on my body faintly oozing blood.

Sophia narrowed her eyes, revealing only her desire to control me.

Until -

"The watch has been found!"

Sophia took the emerald watch and personally put it on Jack's wrist, her tone doting.

"Don't be so careless next time."

Jack scratched his head embarrassedly, looking at me with a face full of guilt:

"This was a gift from you. Luckily we found it. But I wrongly accused Mr. Wilson. Should I apologize to him?"

In front of everyone, looking at me covered in blood stains,

Sophia's voice was utterly cold.

"No need. He's just a bodyguard, a dog I keep. What's the big deal about suffering a little grievance?"

In the bathroom, I couldn't stop dry heaving.

Before I could recover, Jack kicked me hard.

He pressed down hard on the tattoo on my body, veins bulging on his forehead.

"You're really cheap, aren't you? You're just a dog Sophia keeps, yet you still cling to her!"

"Speaking of which, do you know why Sophia sent you to buy medicine in the next city when your mom was critically ill?"

"It was because she just wanted to get rid of you. At that time, I stripped naked with Sophia right in front of your mom - she was literally angered to death!"

"Slap!"

After slapping Jack's face, I couldn't hold back anymore and grabbed his throat.

Jack laughed coldly, instantly fighting back.

He kept splashing cold water on me, but accidentally touched a dry electrical appliance.

In the blink of an eye,

We both heard the sizzling sound from the electrical appliance simultaneously.

The next second, it instantly exploded, and the entire bathroom was filled with thick smoke.

Soon, anxious cries for help were heard outside the door.

Sophia's voice came along with the sound of high heels: "Where's Jack Wilson!"

She rushed in regardless of the raging fire.

But her gaze immediately fell on Jack, who was pretending to faint.

He reached out his hand, tears in his eyes: "Sophia, save me..."

Ignoring me whose shirt was dyed red with blood.

Sophia's face tense with worry as she supported Jack and walked out without looking back.

From beginning to end, not a single glance fell on me.

I fell to my knees weakly, choked by the thick smoke. The pain on my body seemed to magnify infinitely in an instant.

The next second, a pair of black leather shoes appeared in my vision.

I looked up dazedly, and it was actually Jack's lackey.

A vicious smile appeared on his face as he pushed me hard.

Already next to the window, I fell unprepared.

"Don't blame me for being ruthless. Only if Jack has good days can I rise with him."

He turned back confidently, not realizing he had actually helped me escape the fire scene.

It was only the fourth floor.

I dragged my limping leg and hailed a taxi, telling the driver: "Airport."

The scenery outside the car window rapidly receded.

I took out my phone, removed the SIM card, and snapped it in half -

"Crack."

The card broke into two halves, casually tossed out the window by me.

Sophia Evans, from now on, you and I will completely disappear from each other's lives!
