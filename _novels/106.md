Everyone in the city knows me as a Manhattan socialite.

Jasper loves me deeply. I once thought I would spend a warm and peaceful life with him.

But everything changed when his adopted sister, Kaia, developed gender identity disorder and became obsessed with him, treating him as if he were a romantic partner.

When I confronted Jasper, he was indifferent: "It's just temporary. Be patient. Once Kaia gets better, I'll love you again!"

He allowed Kaia to hurt me repeatedly without concern.

My heart grew weary. On the day he married Kaia, I started a confidential 10-year project. Later, I heard my husband mention that Jasper had been searching for me for ten years.
