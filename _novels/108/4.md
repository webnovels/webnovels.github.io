But within days, their strong alliance showed cracks. Beatrix was annoyed that Cora only knew how to order her around. Hazel thought Cora was too demanding, insisting on separate basins for washing different things.

But who has that many? The basins all serve the same purpose. She's just picky, only good-looking but can't manage a household, a wasteful person!

Soon, everyone found excuses not to come. Cora, who was always proud, felt helpless with postpartum bleeding, at their mercy.

Finn Nolan didn't come to see her. She could only watch the affectionate couple next to her and silently cry.

Postpartum emotions are volatile, and the baby's nightly cries didn't help. Cora's once beautiful face was gone, and her hair, once a source of pride, fell out in clumps each night.

Seeing this scene, I found it laughable. This was the happy life Cora chose over me.

But perhaps Beatrix realized leaving Cora alone in the hospital wasn't right. She called me, ordering, “Your sister is hospitalized, go stay with her, quickly! Don't make me angry! I'm telling you only once!”

Silence, a long silence. The person on the other end grew impatient: “Are you deaf? Your mom is talking to you. Don’t you know to answer? Who taught you to be so rude?”

“You're all making me worry, did I raise enemies? I'm your mom, you have to listen to me whether you like it or not!”
