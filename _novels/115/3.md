I was forcibly taken to the banquet.

Nora leaned against Jude, constantly praising.

"Jude, where did you find such a beauty? This plan will work for sure!"

"She's just too skinny, like a skeleton."

She frowned, as if dissatisfied with a product.

Jude's expression soured, but he still embraced her waist, comforting her, "Nora, trust me to handle it."

Nora blushed, "Let go! I haven't agreed to your proposal yet!"

Proposal?

All color drained from my face.

"Uncle, since you've proposed to her, why promise to be with me? Or—"

"You just wanted to trick me into seducing Felix!"

Jude had a moment of panic.

But faced with Nora's questioning, he nearly dragged me to the garden in anger.

In a secluded spot, he gripped my neck tightly.

"Cora, you have a death wish!"

The suffocating sensation mixed with the pain on my neck.

Those were scars from his countless licks and bites.

"Jude, do you want... to kill me..."

Proposal?

I felt a chill run through me, my face turning pale.

"Uncle, if you've already proposed to her, why did you promise to be with me? Unless—"

"Was it just to manipulate me into seducing Felix?"

For a brief moment, Jude looked flustered. But faced with Nora's questioning, he angrily dragged me toward the back garden.

In a secluded spot, he grabbed my neck with alarming force.

"Cora, do you have a death wish?"

The pain and suffocation overwhelmed me, reminders of the many marks he had left on my skin.

"Jude, are you trying to kill me?"

Seeing my face turn red from lack of air, Jude snapped back to reality and released me.

I crumpled to the ground, coughing violently.

"Cora?" He hesitated, reaching out as if to help me up.

I turned away, disgusted.

Nora's voice was calling; she was looking for us.

Jude regained his composure and coldly warned:

"Cora, know your place. You're nothing more than a secret I've kept hidden, an embarrassment. Falling for your CEO Uncle, doesn't that make you sick? And you still want to be with me, shameless."

"You'd better go and seduce Felix as planned. After I marry Nora, I might still need you to satisfy my needs!"

He turned away, leaving only scattered leaves behind.

The cold was piercing.

I attempted to stand but collapsed again.

"Ugh—"

Blood splattered onto my white dress.

The phone rang; it was the doctor calling.

"Hello..."

"Cora, are you choosing not to live? Skipping chemotherapy?"

After my stomach cancer diagnosis, the hospital assigned me a new attending physician, whom I hadn't met yet.

"What's your surname? I... I'm not available right now. Can I come another day?"

"Surname's Felix. Miss Cora, life-saving matters can't wait."

Felix? Sharing the same surname as Felix, what a coincidence.

I'm sorry, but I need the specific text content to provide a translation.

I wiped the blood from the corner of my mouth, determined to leave for good.

Jude, it's over between us.

I don't want to be with you anymore, Felix, and I certainly won't seduce you.

As I was leaving, my hands were pinned to the ground.
