Jude's episode was particularly intense this time.

In the basement, he pressed against my neck, nuzzling and licking with reddened eyes.

"Where did you go? Hmm?"

His warm breath on my unhealed wound stung a bit.

I shrank back, clutching the diagnosis report in my hand.

The follow-up confirmed it was stomach cancer.

The doctor said there's still hope, but I need to act quickly.

His grip on my waist tightened, his voice hoarse, "What are you avoiding?"

"Uncle sent you a dress. Remember to wear it to the banquet tomorrow. Felix likes the pure look."

A sharp pain shot through my stomach.

I suppressed the urge to retch, pushing against Jude's chest. "Let me go..."

"Don't move, it's not healed."

He pressed me against the cold, dirty wall, holding tightly.

"Cora, don't you want to be with Uncle?"

I stopped resisting.

Jude chuckled softly, kissing my forehead.

"Be good. If you want acknowledgment, do as I say."

"Tomorrow, I'll have some media at the door. Make sure they get a clear shot of Felix's face, alright?"

I felt a chill, looking up in disbelief.

To become a stage actor, I worked hard for ten years to fulfill my dream.

Being caught by the media with poor morals would ruin my career.

"Jude, if they catch me with Felix, my life is over!"

My eyes reddened, holding back tears.

Jude frowned, hesitating, "Cora..."

The shrill ringtone shattered the silence.

"Jude, what do I do? The engagement party's tomorrow, I don't want to marry Felix..."

The person on the line sobbed.

Jude's expression changed instantly, pushing me away.

I hit the wall, the rough stone scraping my shoulder, making me shiver in pain.

"Nora, don't cry. I'll figure something out, trust me, okay? I've arranged everything, just follow the plan!"

He comforted her over the phone, promising she wouldn't be harmed.

I stood there, listening to his gentle words.

Suddenly, it felt so humiliating.

I didn't know how much time passed, my limbs growing numb.

After hanging up, Jude slung me over his shoulder, striding upstairs.

"Cora, try on the new dress Uncle bought you."

My stomach felt unbearable, and I pounded Jude's shoulder. "Put me down!"

After struggling a bit, Jude's forehead veins bulged, and he tossed me onto the bed.

"Cora, stop being ungrateful!"

I curled up, enduring wave after wave of stabbing pain in my stomach.

Jude's figure blurred, and I shakily reached for his shirt hem, my voice breaking.

"Uncle, I'm sick..."

Jude paused, instinctively asking, "Cora, what's wrong?"

Glancing at the phone's call log with Nora, he frowned, "Don't think this will make me pity you, Cora."

He stepped back, and my hand grasped at empty air.

"It's... it's stomach cancer..." I could only whisper through the pain.

A long silence.

A cold snort came from above.

"Stomach cancer?! Who are you trying to fool? You can't just decide to have cancer!"

I frantically searched my pockets for the diagnosis report. "Uncle, I'm not lying, I have the diagnosis!"

But at that moment, the paper was gone!

A sense of helplessness flooded me.

Seeing this, Jude sneered, "Enough, stop looking."

He dragged me from the bed to the wardrobe, throwing me to the floor.

He pulled out a snow-white dress.

"If you have a stomach ailment, then don't eat. Just think about how to get Felix to sleep with you!"

He slammed the door, locking it from the outside.

Faintly, I heard Jude make a call.

"Nora, you haven't had an appetite. I'll cook for you personally, okay? What do you want to eat?"

Kneeling on the cold floor, tears fell uncontrollably.

So, love and indifference are really this obvious.

Fine.

I'll let go, isn't that enough?
