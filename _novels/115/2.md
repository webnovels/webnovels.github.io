When Jude opened the door, I was just spitting blood into the sink.

My phone lit up, a message from the new attending doctor:

Miss Cora, chemotherapy must start today, no more delays.

Washing away the blood, I struggled out of the bathroom.

"Cora, why do you look so pale?"

Jude hurried over.

I avoided his hand, speaking coldly, "I'm fine."

He sighed with relief, offering a bowl of chicken soup.

"Hungry? Try this."

The soup was still warm, and I forced down a sip.

"Cora, after drinking the soup, you have to really help Uncle tonight."

I stared blankly at the bowl. "Uncle, did you put hawthorn in it?"

Jude smiled, patting my head. "Yes, I added a few pieces while cooking, to enhance the flavor."

A piercing pain spread through my heart.

Nora loves hawthorn; this was her leftover soup.

But I'm allergic to hawthorn, even a touch makes it hard to breathe.

The new housekeeper, Liu, knew after three days.

But Jude, who lived with me for thirteen years, didn't know.

"Sweetheart, put on this dress and show Uncle."

I stood there numbly, like a puppet being dressed.

Jude's actions suddenly halted.

He gripped my waist, exclaiming, "Cora, how did you get so thin!"

His heated hands burnt me, my stomach twisting painfully.

Having stomach cancer inevitably leads to weight loss.

But he said—

"You're so skinny and ugly. What if Felix doesn't like you?"

Jude frowned, looking at me with blame.

I forced a bitter smile. "Uncle, what do I mean to you?"

Jude froze, pulling me into a tight embrace. "You're Uncle's treasure, Uncle can't be without you."

Tears fell uncontrollably.

No, I argued internally.

I'm your relief for hunger, a pawn to help Nora, a gift for another man.

But not your treasure.

"I... I need to go to the hospital today."

The doctor said I couldn't delay chemotherapy anymore.

Jude released me, a confusing disappointment in his eyes.

"Cora, I always thought you were obedient. Why do you lie so much now? Can't I tell if you're sick?"

"You know today's Felix and Nora's engagement party. Is faking illness fun?"

I coughed heavily, the taste of blood lingering.

"Uncle, I'll come back obediently after the hospital."

I tugged his shirt, nearly begging.

Jude coldly brushed my hand away. "Enough, Cora, I've spoiled you, making you addicted to lying!"

I shook my head in despair. "Jude, for the woman you can't have, you'd rather not believe me?"

"Slap!"

A harsh slap landed on my face.

Blood trickled from my mouth.

Amidst the ringing in my ears, Jude's indifferent voice came through.

"Cora, continue this madness, and you're out of this house forever!"

Heart-wrenching pain.

I used to hug him and admit my mistakes.

But this time, I just stood there, coldly uttering a few words.

"Fine, I couldn't wish for anything more."

I've had enough.

Jude panicked.

He reached out, holding me close. "Cora, Uncle was joking. How could Uncle bear to lose you..."

Soft kisses fell on my forehead.

"Come with Uncle tonight, and after it's done, we'll be together."

But I'd already given up, my gaze vacant.

"Uncle, what if... I'm dying."

Jude stiffened, holding me tighter. "Cora, you're Uncle's life, you won't die."

I closed my eyes, tears falling.

Yes, I would.

The doctor said if untreated, I wouldn't last a few more days.
