Rachel's mother, Olivia Clark, was critically ill. In her final moments of lucidity in the ICU, she decided to dictate her will.

"Mrs. Clark, you want to make your will, correct?" the lawyer asked.

"Yes, while I'm still clear-headed... I need to address the matter of my estate," Olivia replied, her voice weak but each word pronounced clearly.

Mr. Johnson, the lawyer, took out his pen and notebook, his expression turning serious behind his glasses. "Alright, Mrs. Clark, go ahead."

"Besides the house back in our hometown, I have $1.48 million in my bank account."

This statement exploded like a bomb in the hospital room.

Rachel looked at her mother in disbelief. When did her mother save up $1.48 million? She was a retired senior citizen with a monthly pension of just over $2,000.

"The house in our hometown will go to Tyler," Olivia continued.

Tyler, hearing this, smiled slightly, as if it was expected. The house was worth about $2 million.

"As for... the savings... they'll go to Tyler too. My old jewelry from the house will go to Rachel."

Olivia finished speaking, her voice trembling but her tone firm.
