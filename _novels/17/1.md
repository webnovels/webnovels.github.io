When I was brought to the emergency room, I was already unconscious.
The doctor administered epinephrine.
"Ma'am, can you hear me?" a worried voice asked near my ear. "You were in a car accident with severe bleeding. We're urgently sourcing Type P blood. Without an immediate transfusion, the fetus might not survive."
I weakly nodded.
"Do you need to call a family member?"
I slowly opened my eyes, my mind replaying the scene at the bar.
I had been in this book's world for five years, just to save Gideon, the tragic second male lead.
He was young, successful, and ambitious but was abandoned by his childhood sweetheart, the heroine.
He worked tirelessly to create a designer brand, only to be diagnosed with leukemia a few years later.
He eventually died because a matching bone marrow donor could not be found.
When I arrived in the story, it was near the end.
I fell in love with him and tried hard to conceive, hoping to give birth to the child that could save him.
When I saw the blood test report showing the fetus had the same blood type as Gideon, I was overjoyed.
Especially after Gideon "lost his sight," I was extra cautious, fearing anything might trigger his leukemia.
I bought him an accessible smartphone, which he used to meet women.
He threw tantrums and went out drinking at night, while I stayed up waiting for him to return.
Keeping this child alive was the only way Gideon could survive; otherwise, he would surely die.
Thinking about this, I dialed the phone.
Before I could speak, Gideon's voice came through, indifferent, "I'll be home later. You don't need to wait up. Just go to sleep."
"By the way, there's a blizzard tonight. Remember to lock the windows and turn on the heat. You just recovered from a cold, don't catch another one."
"I'm at the hospital," I replied.
There was a pause on the other end, "What?"
I heard the rustling of clothes and a woman's soft moan.
Gideon groaned, suppressing his desire, "What's wrong? Do you need me to come now... but the roads are slippery, and I can't see. If something happens on the way, you'll have to take care of me..."
My heart sank, "It's nothing, just heavy bleeding from my period. I came to get it checked."
Gideon sighed with relief.
"Nora, I don't want to affect next week's wedding... Rest well in the hospital, and I'll pick you up tomorrow..."
I swallowed my reply, and the call ended abruptly.
Fortunately, the nearby hospital had a few bags of Type P blood left, just enough to save the pregnancy.
Unfortunately, the OB-GYN ward was full, so I had to stay in the ER temporarily.
"It's okay," the nurse reassured me gently, "We'll do our best to save the fetus. As long as we get these few bags of blood in..."
Before she could finish, a man's voice shouted outside the ER.
"What? No Type P blood?"
I immediately recognized it was Gideon.
"My friend got cut by glass and needs a transfusion... What do you mean it's already used? Where's the person? I'll negotiate..."
The ER curtain was suddenly pulled open.
I struggled to lift my head, and Gideon stared blankly at the blood-stained white cloth beneath me.
"It's you?" Worry flickered in his eyes, "How did you end up in the ER?"
"Aren't you blind? How do you know it's me?"
Gideon shrugged, "We've been together for so long, I can recognize your scent... The blood smell here is strong, are you okay?"
I was about to tell him the truth.
Then his next words hit me like a brick.
"If you're okay, can you let my friend have the Type P blood? She seems to need it more than you."
