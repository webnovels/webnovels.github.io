It wasn't long before another room opened up.

The nurses moved me next to Daphne's room.

Lying in bed, I idly browsed my phone, seeing friends' wedding congratulations, feeling a mix of emotions.

A year ago, Gideon proposed to me.

He spent half a year preparing the wedding, handling everything from the bouquet to the wedding dress and ring selection.

Even the invitations sent to guests were designed and handwritten by him, delivered in person.

Everyone envied me for marrying a man like Gideon, successful and loving.

Before Daphne returned to visit, I believed in it completely.

But since her return, my relationship with Gideon subtly changed. He was always called away for various reasons when we were together.

Later, he even had an old injury relapse, going blind.

Suddenly, I saw a question on a social platform.

"Did you marry your first love?"

"The first love is to relive old dreams. The one you marry may not be the one you love most, but is the most suitable."

The answer was from Gideon's profile picture.

I smiled and turned off the screen.

Outside the room, I heard the tap of a white cane. Gideon feared the medical staff would notice his act.

The footsteps stopped at the door.

From the next room, I heard a playful reprimand.

Moments later, Gideon entered with a bag.

"I specially bought you some blood-replenishing soup. Drink it while it's hot."

He fumbled to place it on the bedside table. I noticed the plastic bag's store name was from miles away.

"Went that far?"

Gideon's breathing hitched, "I took a cab. It's near our old place. You know that store's soup works best..."

Yes, every time I had my period, Gideon would buy it to nourish me.

But now, the plastic lid had been opened, clearly meant for someone else, not me.

"Leave it, I'm not hungry." I looked up indifferently, "Why not give it to Daphne? She bled too, didn't she?"

"She won't drink it..."

Before he could finish, Gideon noticed my scrutinizing gaze with a smile, hastily closing his mouth.

"I mean..."

"It's okay," I interrupted, "Daphne is your friend. It's only right I give way to her. All good."

Yes, every time I was on my period, Gideon made sure to get me something nourishing.

But now, the plastic box is already open, and I can tell it wasn’t for me—he must have taken a cab to get it for someone else.

“Just leave it there, I’m not hungry,” I said, glancing up nonchalantly. “Why not give it to Daphne? She’s bleeding too, isn’t she?”

“She doesn’t drink it…”

Gideon trailed off, catching the amused look in my eyes and quickly clamming up.

“What I mean is…”

“It’s okay,” I cut him off, “Daphne’s your friend, it’s only fair I step aside. It’s all fine.”

Gideon froze, a wave of unease washing over him.

He thought Nora was eerily calm today, a kind of calm that was unsettling.

It seemed like she was slipping away from him.

“What do you want to eat? I’ll order something in.”

I shook my head, staying silent.

“That won’t do...” Gideon sat on the bed, gently caressing my cheek. “You’ve lost weight. How will you fit into the wedding dress next week... and I don’t want the engagement ring slipping off your finger during the ceremony...”

Thinking of the wedding dress and ring Gideon had personally designed and helped create, the bitterness in my heart wasn’t as intense as I’d imagined.

Just a pity.

Five years of love and effort couldn’t change his fate of dying young.

“I don’t know if it’s pre-wedding jitters or what, but I’ve been feeling dizzy and anemic these past few days, my body feels hot…”

Anemia and fever are early signs of leukemia.

According to the timeline, Gideon would be diagnosed in just over half a year.

“Gideon.” I suddenly spoke seriously, “How about we cancel the wedding next week?”

He was startled, almost forgetting he was pretending to be blind.

“What’s wrong? Don’t scare me... Did I do something to upset you?”

“No,” I pouted, “Didn’t you suddenly go blind? I’m worried about how that’ll affect the wedding…”

“No way, I will definitely get better.”

Gideon stammered anxiously, “Even if I have to crawl, I’ll make it to the stage... Lately, I’ve been irritable because of the blindness, spending days away from home drinking with friends, I know it makes you uncomfortable…”

“But you have to understand me, Nora... I promise I won’t do it again after we get married, so please stop worrying, okay?”

I nodded and agreed, “Alright.”

Gideon coaxed me to sleep, thoughtfully tucking me in.

Thinking I was asleep, he got up and went to the next room to be with Daphne.

A nurse came in holding a small bottle.

“This is the embryo’s ashes, we return it to the family as per regulations.”

I tucked the bottle into the drawer, “If my boyfriend asks, please tell him the truth.”

“And then, please help me with the discharge procedures.”
