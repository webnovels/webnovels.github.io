The nurse was about to speak, but Gideon left.
I didn't know if he was afraid of exposing his fake blindness or if he couldn't stand the strong smell of blood.
The nurse wanted to speak but I stopped her.
Through the transparent curtain, I could see Gideon's concern for Daphne.
Daphne sat in a wheelchair, her bare leg bleeding from a glass cut—no need to imagine the scene.
Gideon comforted her while urging me to give up the blood bags.
"What if I said I'd die without these blood bags?"
Gideon paused outside the curtain, then his face darkened.
"Don't joke around. You naturally have a cold constitution, a heavy period is no big deal. At worst, I'll make you black sugar red date tea for a month."
"I'm joking," I lowered my eyes and chuckled, "You take them to save your friend."
Daphne was his first love. They separated due to a misunderstanding, and now both are about to get married, enjoying their last fling.
The nurse looked troubled, "But your baby..."
I smiled bitterly, watching the blood keep flowing from me, and before I passed out, I left one last instruction.
"Save the mother."
When I woke up again, I couldn't feel the baby's heartbeat anymore.
The extracted fetal tissue was sealed in a box, and the nurse was preparing to transfer me to the OB-GYN ward that had just opened up.
When I first confirmed the pregnancy, I signed an agreement.
If the fetus couldn't be saved, the cord blood and stem cells would be extracted as a precaution.
I gave everything to save Gideon's life.
"The equipment can't be moved, we need to get to the OB-GYN ward immediately."
Two nurses pushed me out of the ER.
Under the cover of the white cloth, the sealed box held the blood mass.
Gideon suddenly pushed Daphne in front of me.
"Nora, the hospital is out of beds everywhere. Can you let Daphne have your bed?"
I stared at him.
Finally, the nurse couldn't hold back, "You're Nora's family, shouldn't you care more about your girlfriend? Why does she have to make all the sacrifices?"
"Gideon, I really need to get into the OB-GYN ward right away. If this is delayed..."
Daphne moaned in pain, clutching her bandaged wound.
Gideon frowned, looking conflicted, "I'm begging you, okay?"
"I accidentally broke a bottle at the bar, and Daphne got hurt because of me. You wouldn't want me to feel guilty, right?"
"Nora..." He put on his sunglasses, reaching to grab my hand, "She's about to get married, and you're going to be a bride soon too. Wouldn't you be upset with a big scar on your leg?"
I quietly watched his lips move, the scent of women's perfume making my head spin.
"Okay," I compromised once more.
Gideon was overjoyed, giving me a deep kiss on the forehead.
Watching him leave, I wiped the nausea off my forehead. He had cut off the last path to life with his own hands.
"What about the embryo..."
I closed my eyes, "Burn it."
If Gideon doesn't want to live, then let him be.
