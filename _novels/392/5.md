When I woke up in the morning, the assassin had already left.
I took out the phone I had hidden and held it close to my face, preparing to order some takeout.
Suddenly, the front door of the villa was violently kicked open.
Then someone shouted—
"Olivia, get out here!"
I'd recognize that grating voice anywhere, even if it was autotuned.
Tyler.
The bastard who pushed me down the stairs.
I tapped my cane and slowly walked out. When he saw me, he started mocking me like he used to:
"Well well, still alive I see."
"I thought you'd kicked the bucket by now. I even brought a hearse."
I couldn't be bothered to respond. "What are you doing here?"
Tyler rushed up to me, shoved me to the ground, and kicked away my cane.
"This is my house, I'll come whenever I want!"
Tyler strutted around the living room with his hands in his pockets.
"I'm taking back this house. You have until the end of the day to get out."
"Don't bother cleaning, I'm going to throw out everything you've touched anyway."
I kept my eyes lowered to the floor and said:
"Dad and Mom gave me this house. You have no right to take it back."
Tyler snorted coldly and spat on the floor, yelling:
"They're MY parents! You're nothing but trash. Get the hell out of here!"
With that, he stormed out without looking back.
