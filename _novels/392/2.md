The assassin stopped drying his hair and was silent for a long time before speaking.
"Do you have a death wish?"
"I'll die happy after I feel them."
"..."
He ignored me and turned to leave.
I hurried to follow him, forgetting to grab my cane.
My leg hit the corner of a table.
With a thud, I fell to the ground.
"Ow, it hurts..."
I propped myself up, tears welling in my eyes from the pain.
The assassin sighed and crouched down in front of me. Water droplets from his hair dripped onto my thigh.
His face was very close to mine, but I still couldn't see clearly.
Judging by the outline, he was probably handsome.
Come closer!
Just a little closer and I'll be able to see your face!
I didn't dare look too intently, afraid he would notice.
The assassin looked down at my knee, his warm fingers brushing over the wound.
"You're bleeding. Do you have any iodine?"
I answered irrelevantly, "I want to feel your abs."
"..."
He was speechless again.
I'm not joking, this little injury is nothing. I used to get hurt all the time.
I had to act fast before he got dressed.
The assassin sighed resignedly: "You just want to feel them?"
"Actually, I want to kiss them too."
"...Don't push your luck!"
