I was just feeling his abs...
My movements slowed down.
He also stopped trembling.
I'm not sure if it was because I moved too vigorously or if the towel had a mind of its own.
It fell to the floor.

I pretended not to know what happened. "What's wrong?"
He replied somewhat awkwardly: "Nothing..."
Hehehe.
What an unexpected bonus.
