My name is Olivia. I'm an orphan.
Three years ago, I was adopted by a wealthy family, but none of their children liked me.
Especially the youngest son.
He pushed me down the stairs when I wasn't paying attention. I hit my head on the steps, causing me to go blind.
Actually, I'm not completely blind.
My vision is just very blurry.
To stay alive, I insisted I couldn't see anything at all.
After I was discharged from the hospital, the family sent me to a villa in the suburbs along with a huge sum of money, leaving me to fend for myself.
I couldn't be bothered to seek revenge.
I lived comfortably every day, ordering takeout and opening packages.
But two weeks ago, on a night I'll never forget, an assassin suddenly broke in.
He held a knife to my throat, ready to kill me, but when he realized I was blind, he hesitated.
He only threatened me not to tell anyone.
And so began our strange cohabitation.
His whereabouts were unpredictable. Occasionally he would help cook meals.
But a few meals were far from enough to satisfy me.
As the landlord, I had to show him who's boss.
That night, I crouched outside the bathroom door, imagining his tantalizing body.
The water stopped. The assassin walked out wrapped in a towel.
Steam billowed around him.
Even with my blurry vision, I could make out his broad shoulders and narrow waist.
Tsk tsk, he smelled so good up close.
The assassin saw me. "What are you doing here?"
I faced his chest and cleared my throat. "Let me feel those abs, big boy."
He: "..."
