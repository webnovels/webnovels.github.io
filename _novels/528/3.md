In a hazy dream, I was transported back to a long time ago. Julian confessed his feelings to me after Freshman Orientation Week. I had never considered dating, but if it was him, I simply couldn’t refuse. We got together. Soon after, rumors reached my ears. Many people said: “Julian’s truly in love with Celeste, but he’s just an orphan who was fostered by her family.” “That privileged lady doesn’t even like him. She was afraid her crush would misunderstand their relationship, so Julian just found a random girlfriend.” “Otherwise, why would Julian, the school heartthrob, ever notice an unsophisticated girl like Scarlett?” I thought Julian wasn’t that kind of person, so I asked him directly if it was true. He said no, and I believed him.

After we started dating, Julian was wonderful to me. From high school to junior year of college, our classmates’ relationships came and went, but we remained as if perpetually in love. Even the ones who spread rumors in high school changed their tune. They said they envied us, saying it seemed Julian truly loved me. I always believed that, until senior year, when Celeste returned from studying abroad.

“Celeste is sick.”
“Celeste is upset.”
“Celeste forgot her umbrella.”
“Celeste…”
My once perfect, attentive boyfriend started to frequently ditch me for another woman. The name “Celeste” became a constant ache in my heart. So, when Celeste actively sent me a friend request, I accepted it. I felt like a thief, sneaking glances at her Ins posts:
Turns out, on my birthday, Julian went with her to get her nails done.
Turns out, on our wedding anniversary, he was cooking for her at her house.
Turns out…
There were so many. My eyes stung with tears as I scrolled.

My body ached all over. I opened my eyes and found myself in a hospital room. Ben was guarding me nearby. When he saw I was awake, he looked excited, awkward, and guilty. “Scarlett, you’re finally awake. I’m so sorry. Julian said you were just being dramatic and trying to get attention, and I misunderstood you.”
“When you were swept away, I was terrified.”
“Thank goodness you were lucky enough to be rescued midway, or I really would have regretted it for the rest of my life!”
I didn’t respond to him. My stomach was cramping terribly, and crimson blood streamed from between my legs. I tilted my head back, gasping for air, but it felt like I was back in my last life, when Julian broke my limbs and threw me into that tub… The pain was so intense I couldn’t even scream!

Ben, terrified, quickly called for doctors and nurses. The doctor came in, holding a stack of test results, his brows deeply furrowed. “The pregnant woman suffered a severe infection in the flood. The baby can’t be saved. We need immediate surgery. Has the patient’s family arrived yet?”
“Coming right away, right away!” Ben frantically called Julian. In his haste, he accidentally put it on speaker. Julian’s angry voice blasted from the phone: “Ben, what kind of benefits did Scarlett give you that you’re helping her lie now? And here I thought you were my best friend!”

Ben fired back, “Before you speak, lay a hand on your heart! How severe was this flood? Did you really have no clue whether your two-story house would be flooded?!”
From Julian’s end, Celeste whimpered, saying she was scared of the thunder outside. Julian’s voice instantly softened with concern: “Celeste isn’t doing well. I need to stay with her. Stop bothering me with calls!”
I had always known how much he cared for Celeste. But even now, in this moment, I felt an overwhelming chill. This was the man I had loved with all my heart for over a decade…

The medical instruments shrieked, a piercing alarm. The doctor rushed over instantly: “Patient is hemorrhaging, heart rate dropping rapidly! Prepare for emergency resuscitation!”
