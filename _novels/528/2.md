I didn’t want to go through that agony again, which is why in this life, I sought help from other members of the rescue team. To my shock, Julian had already ruined my reputation within the rescue team, convincing everyone not to save me. I watched my meticulously decorated wedding home being swallowed by the flood, a bitter ache seizing my chest.

Julian had once said that his childhood home was a small two-story house with a yard, and that kind of place felt like a true home. So, I gave up buying a house in the city, pouring all my savings into building a small house with him in his old village. Back then, he hugged me, his eyes red, thanking me for giving him his ideal home and promising to love me forever. And I actually believed him… What a joke.

As the water reached my neck, I refused to sit by and wait for death. I forced open the highest window and, amidst the howling wind and pouring rain, precariously balanced myself on the sill. Below me, less than two feet away, was rushing floodwater. There was nothing on the roof to hold onto for support. If I lost my balance and fell, I’d surely die.

Luckily, I still had some good fortune. Two rescue boats passed by. “Help!” “Help me!” I waved my arms, screaming for help. The first boat heard me and steered closer. It held a middle-aged couple. “It’s a pregnant woman.” “Don’t be scared, darling, we’ll save you now!” Hearing their comforting voices, my eyes stung with tears, and I repeatedly nodded. Thank goodness these strangers were willing to help me.

But just as they brought their boat closer, the second rescue boat also approached. Ben was in it, along with several people he’d already rescued. Ben saw someone about to save me and frowned in disgust. “Brother and Sister, you don’t need to bother with her. She can swim, and she has a kayak. Everyone else might get into trouble, but she won’t.” He was Julian’s teammate and best friend; he never questioned Julian’s words.

Ben shouted at me, “No wonder Julian always says Miss Celeste is a pampered lady, but kind and generous, while you, an unsophisticated country bumpkin, are selfish and greedy… He really wasn’t wrong about you! Scarlett, you’re wasting rescue resources. Do you know how many lives could be lost because of you?!” With the window open, wind and rain poured into the house, and the water level rose even faster than before. The others listened to Ben’s endless rant, growing desperate.

“Are you out of your mind? That’s a pregnant woman! You want her to swim? Would *you* dare to swim in floodwaters?”
“She’s a pregnant woman, almost swept away by the flood, and she can’t ask for help? Does she have to die for it not to be a waste of resources?”
“Don’t listen to this idiot! Just save her!”

Both rescue boats simultaneously sped toward me. But it was already too late. I clung tightly to the window, but the surging floodwaters still ripped me away. I bobbed up and down in the torrent, no matter how hard I thrashed or cried for help, I couldn’t grasp anything to save me. The two rescue boats, which had seemed like my only hope, quickly vanished from my sight. Terror, fear, then finally, despair. In my last conscious moment, I painfully caressed my belly. “I’m so sorry, baby.” “Mommy still couldn’t protect you…”
