"After being reborn, I'm working hard to become the kind of woman Jamie Huntington hates most.

He's into girls with long hair, all sweet and demure.

So, I chopped off my waist-length locks and started spending my nights surfing, snowboarding, partying with my friends.

Last life, I married him only to find out he was in love with his adoptive sister, Amy Huntington.

His mom threatened to disown him if he didn't break it off with her, forcing him to marry me.

It was only because I looked a little like Amy.

After the wedding, he was always cold to me, always sneaking around with Amy.

I cried, I fought, and finally, on the way to file for divorce, I died in a car accident, full of bitterness and regret.

Now that I'm back, my best friend doesn't get it.

""Are you doing all this to get Jamie's attention?"" she asked.

""Nope. I'm doing it to get away from him."""
