Good thing I wasn't stupid enough to sign a prenuptial agreement back then.

This time, I had to fight for Stella's and my own survival.

Stella and I stood outside the imposing gate of Blake's mansion. The security guards eyed us like thieves, scanning us several times, confirming we were wearing cheap clothes, and growing even more impatient.

"What do you want? This is private property, get out of here!"

I took a deep breath, telling myself to stay calm, not to stoop to their level. "Please tell Blake Sterling that his ex-wife is here with his daughter to see him."

The guard sneered, "You say you're Mr. Sterling's ex-wife? There are plenty of women claiming to be his wife these days! Mr. Sterling is very busy now, he doesn't have time for your kind. Beat it!"

I had expected this.

After all, the current Blake Sterling was a high and mighty heir to a fortune. How could he remember the 'rags-to-riches' wife he conveniently forgot?

I stepped back a few paces, pulling Stella with me, and yelled at the top of my lungs:

"Everyone, come see! Blake Sterling swore undying love to me back then!

He promised to be good to me forever, but now that he's rich, he throws me and his daughter aside!

Is there any justice left in this world?"

Blake's mansion was in a wealthy neighborhood, surrounded by affluent residents.

Hearing my shouts, people immediately gathered, curious.

"Oh dear, these days, there are too many women who tried to hook a rich guy and failed, aren't there?"

"Look how shabbily dressed the mother and daughter are. They must be trying to extort money."

"Mr. Sterling is known as a good man; he dotes on his wife and children. How could he abandon them?"

Listening to the whispers around me, I smirked inwardly.

Blake Sterling, you acted all high and mighty, but today, I'm going to rip off your mask!

I pulled out a copy from my canvas bag and held it over my head.
