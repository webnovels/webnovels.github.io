Of course, I knew why Blake didn't want me inside.

The mansion wasn't just home to him now.

It also housed Celeste, his late brother's widow, whom he now publicly claimed as his wife, along with her two children.

Everyone comfortably seated on the living room sofa knew Celeste was the 'official' Mrs. Sterling, the one Blake presented to the world as his wife.

As for me, his suddenly reappearing 'ex-wife,' Blake naturally had no idea how to explain me.

After all, he was the one who cried and begged to marry me, and now he wished he could erase me from his life.

But I was here today to make him lose face.

Blake stared at me with a twisted expression, probably cursing me eight hundred times in his head.

Celeste's eyes darted around, and then she suddenly walked over, taking my hand with a forced warmth.

"Oh, dear sister, what are you saying?

Since you're Blake's... friend, you're certainly a guest here.

It's normal for him to be caught off guard when you bring your child. Don't misunderstand, please come in and sit down."

With that, she tried to pull me towards the nearby lounge area.

I coldly pulled my hand away. "You must be Celeste, right?"

Celeste's face stiffened, but she forced a smile and nodded.

In my past life, I was foolish. I always thought she was so pitiful, having lost her husband at such a young age.

I had no guard against her, believing everything she said. And what happened?

My daughter died instantly, spitting blood, after eating a cake Celeste had given her!

"No need for the lounge area. Didn't Mr. Sterling just say guests were visiting?

My daughter and I are hungry, we'll just eat something here. And perhaps Mr. Sterling can introduce us to everyone?"

"Scarlett!"

Blake growled, "Are you deliberately trying to embarrass the Sterling family, dressed like that to see guests?

At least change your clothes. Celeste, take her to change..."

Blake froze mid-sentence, realizing what he'd said. Seeing my silence, he quickly explained.

"Scarlett, don't misunderstand. Celeste is my only relative in this family.

I treat her like a sister, that's why I call her that."

"There's absolutely nothing improper between us!"

Blake's desperate explanation only made me sick to my stomach.

The scene before my death in the last life, I could never forget it.

Celeste sobbing, lying.

She claimed my daughter was greedy, accidentally ate the expired cake she'd left on the dining table because she was going to throw it away. She swore that wretched child stole it, which was why she died from the poison.

Blake didn't shed a single tear for us. Instead, he tenderly embraced Celeste, his face full of affection.

He gently wiped away her tears, holding her close to comfort her.

He said, "If she's dead, she's dead. Even if she hadn't died, I was going to marry you anyway."

"All these years, my eyes have only been on you and the two kids. There's no room for anyone else, and I won't allow anyone to disturb our life."


From that moment, I completely gave up.

Celeste led me into a room and tossed me an old dress she'd worn, telling me to change.

Blake was squatting in front of Stella. "Don't you remember Daddy?"
