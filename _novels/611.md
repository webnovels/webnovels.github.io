Chapter 1
For 20 years, Zoe Holt had been the Holts' treasured daughter until their true daughter arrived with a DNA report. She discovered then that she was just a stand-in who was switched at birth.

Humiliated, she packed her bags to leave. But on the night of her departure, she was pulled into a car by her older brother, Alder Holt, who'd always been cold and aloof toward her.

He had her pinned against the leather seat and bawling her eyes out three times over. But even when her voice went hoarse from crying, he gripped her waist and whispered in her ear several times over, "I've wanted to do this to you for years."

In that moment, she finally understood that his years of indifference had been nothing but restraint.

Soon after, he announced their engagement and refused to yield to anyone's objections. When their parents opposed it, he stripped them of their authority and rose to be the sole head of the Holt family.

When the Holts' true daughter, Vera Holt, threw a tantrum, Alder froze all her cards and warned that if she kept acting out, he'd send her back where she came from.

Meanwhile, Zoe couldn't accept dating Alder, the brother she'd grown up with. She fled countless times, only to have him bring her back again and again.

It was almost as if he had her within his grip of control, leaving her nowhere to escape.

That lasted until half a month ago, when he drove out late at night to buy her favorite cake and got into a car accident. When he woke up, he'd lost all his memories.

The Holts rejoiced. When they introduced Zoe, nothing was mentioned about her being the woman Alder loved to madness. She was claimed to be a simple maid.

And now, they were trying to take advantage of his memory loss to send her away.

"Here's 100 million dollars." Arthur Holt and Edith Fairchild pushed the check toward Zoe and continued, "Take the money and leave while Alder doesn't remember you. We raised you, so now, we're begging you for this favor. Never appear in front of him again, and never let him find you."

After a long silence, Zoe slowly agreed, "Fine. I'll complete my paperwork and leave Cerulea in two weeks. I'm never coming back."

As she took the flimsy check, it felt as if the past year had been nothing but an absurd dream. The Holts wanted her gone, and truthfully, she wanted to leave, too.

Alder might have adored her deeply this past year, but she could not bear the weight of his forced love. Now that he'd lost his memory, this was her only chance to leave him.

"What are you doing?"

Just then, the front door opened. Alder stood at the entrance with Vera right behind him.

Dressed in a sharp, tailored suit, he was a stunningly handsome man. The oppressiveness he gave off as someone in power seemed to freeze the air in the room.

Arthur's and Edith's faces paled. They quickly forced a smile and laughed it off. "Nothing. We were just giving the maid some instructions."

Then, Edith nudged Arthur and gestured. "I guess we'll go upstairs for a nap now."

Before leaving, she shot Zoe a vicious glare that was heavy with warning.

Zoe lowered her head as she clutched the hundred-million-dollar check.

Just as she was about to return to the staff quarters, however, Alder's cold voice sounded from afar. "Stop right there."

She froze in place and hung her head low. Her heart had almost missed a beat.

The sound of leather shoes clicking against the floor drew closer. Immediately after, a hand forcibly lifted her chin, and she was compelled to meet his deep, dark eyes.

Her breath hitched, and the images she'd tried to bury flooded her mind. Memories of being pinned against the floor-to-ceiling windows, pressed into the bed, and laid across the kitchen island surged back.

His thumb rubbing her chin, his gaze was cold as he asked, "What perfume are you wearing?"

Zoe opened her mouth to reply, but Alder interrupted her.

"Don't wear it again. A maid should do a maid's job. Don't try to seduce anyone," he warned, and released her with disgust.

Zoe clenched her fingers slightly. He used to bury his face in her neck and chuckle. "What are you wearing? It smells so good."

She would shake her head. "Nothing at all."

Then, he would bite her earlobe and whisper, "Even your natural scent is intoxicating, Zoe. Every inch of you was made for me, and you're never allowed to leave me. Run where you will, and I'll always bring you back. Got it?"

She used to believe she'd never be able to escape, but this time, the heavens were giving her a chance.

Zoe decided not to argue or explain, simply nodding. "Understood, Mr. Holt."

As Alder turned and entered the study, she finally let out a breath of relief. 

Just as she was about to return to the quarters and pack her stuff, Vera stormed up and slapped her hard. "Zoe, have you no shame? You seduced Alder, and now that he's lost his memory, you're still trying to get him!" she shrieked.

"I'm telling you now—Alder has a fiancée!" she smugly continued. "The engagement will be announced any day now, and she's a thousand times better than you!"

Zoe trembled slightly. A fiancée?

Of course. Now that he'd lost his memory, women from powerful families would rush to line up for a wedding alliance, given the Holt family's status. But none of it had anything to do with her anymore.

Still, Vera wasn't going to let it slide. Her voice turned sharp as she ordered, "Grab her, and lock her in the freezer! Let's see what happens to women who seduce Alder!"

The guards exchanged glances, and none dared make a move. Everyone knew how much Alder used to spoil Zoe.

Once, a business partner touched her hand, and that hand showed up on Alder's desk the next day.

Vera trembled with rage. "Alder has amnesia now! She's no longer the Holts' daughter or the woman he loves! What are you all afraid of?"

She pointed at the guards and warned, "If you don't take her away, you're all fired!"

Still, they hesitated.

Just then, the door to the study swung open, and Alder stepped out with a frown. "What's going on?"

Vera immediately put on a sweet smile. "Zoe isn't doing her job properly, Alder. I'm sending her to the freezer to be punished, but the guards won't listen to me."

Alder gave the guards a cold glare and asked in a cold voice, "What did she give you to ignore your employer's orders?"

Then, he turned to Zoe with eyes full of disdain and spat, "Take her away. What an eyesore."

With that, he slammed the door shut.

With his command, the guards no longer hesitated.

Zoe closed her eyes and allowed them to drag her away. 

She'd always feared the cold, so Alder kept the villa warm like spring all year round. If her hands and feet were cold at night, he'd humble himself and press her feet to his chest to warm them.

But now, he'd given the command to lock her in the freezer as her punishment.

In the freezing room, Zoe curled into a corner as her consciousness slowly faded.

"It's okay. Just hold on a little longer, and I can leave very soon," she murmured to herself.

It wouldn't be long before she could stop being Alder's possession and return to simply being Zoe Holt.

Just as she was about to pass out, she vaguely heard someone screaming her name almost madly, "Zoe!"

A figure rushed into the freezer and lifted her into trembling arms.


Chapter 2
When Zoe woke up, she was met with the glaring white of the hospital ceiling.

"Zoe, how are you feeling? Are you still in pain?"

A familiar voice rang in her ears before a gentle face with soft facial features entered her sight. Eyes red-rimmed, Luke Stanton was sitting by her side. It looked like he'd been keeping watch over her for a long time.

"...Luke?"

The memories before she lost consciousness slowly pieced themselves together. She forced herself to sit up and asked, "Were you the one who saved me?"

Luke nodded. His voice sounded like he was still trying to recover from the lingering fear. "I kept trying to call you, but couldn't get through. When I rushed to the Holt residence, I learned that you were locked in the freezer…"

Halfway through his words, the TV in the ward suddenly switched to reporting breaking news…

"Holt Corporation and Vance Corporation officially announced their wedding alliance today. Mr. Alder Holt and Ms. Elara Vance shall hold their wedding next month…"

On the screen, Alder stood in a sharp, tailored suit and wore a stern, unreadable expression. Beside him, Elara held his arm as a bright, radiant smile lit up her face. They were the picture-perfect couple.

Luke immediately grabbed the remote and turned the TV off. The room fell into a brief silence for several seconds before he exhaled deeply and turned to her.

"Zoe, I know everything that's happened recently. You couldn't escape, but now that Alder has lost his memory… Let me take you away, alright?" His voice was soft but resolute.

Zoe lowered his gaze and mumbled, "Thank you, Luke. I've started getting ready for the procedures needed to go abroad. The Holt family's power is rooted in politics, and he can't leave Cerulea."

She paused and added, "But once I'm abroad, he'll never be able to find me again."

A flash of relief flickered in Luke's eyes as he instinctively reached out and held her hand. "That's great! Let's handle the paperwork together!"

She stiffened slightly and pulled her hand back.

Realizing he'd overstepped, Luke quickly apologized. "I'm sorry. I just… got too emotional."

After a brief pause, his warm, sincere eyes met her gaze as he said, "But I hope you understand how I feel. You must be able to tell by now, can't you?"

Zoe stayed silent and did not answer.

Of course, she knew. From the very beginning when Alder began forcing his way into her life, Luke had always been quietly helping her. He once even offered to take her away, but she knew better than anyone how ruthless Alder could be.

She'd tried to escape more than ten times but never succeeded. The longest she'd ever lasted on the run was ten minutes before getting caught again.

There was once a man who simply flirted with her at a bar. The next day, he disappeared from the city without a trace.

Alder's reach extended everywhere. There had been no escape for her, and she dared not inflict Luke, either. That was why she'd never responded to his feelings.

Closing her eyes, her fingers trembled slightly as she said, "Luke, I…"

Sensing what she was about to say, he intercepted. "I'm not asking for an answer now. I just want to tell you…"

He took a deep breath and continued in a soft yet firm voice, "Once you leave this place, you can finally live a life of your own. You can work your favorite job, travel to places that make you happy, and… fall in love again.

"I'll be happy for you even if it's not with me. All I want is for you to return to a normal life and not let this past year ruin it." He gave her a small, bitter smile.

Zoe was stunned, and her eyes gradually welled up with tears.

After a long pause, she whispered, "Thank you. Once I leave this place, I'll start fresh. I'll travel, work, and fall in love." She turned her eyes to the warm sunlight outside the window.

Luke finally relaxed. The tension in his expression melted away into a gentle smile as he offered, "Let me come with you while you handle the paperwork."

That afternoon, he tagged along while she completed her expedited visa process.

"The visa should be ready in two weeks. Enjoy your trip," the staff said as they handed her her ID card.

Stepping out of the embassy, Zoe let out a long breath. Sunlight spilled over her face, and for the first time in what felt like forever, a sense of lightness returned to her chest.

Luke drove her back to the Holt residence. Along the journey, he chattered happily about all the plans they'd make abroad.

He told her that once her visa came through, she should leave first. His family had business abroad, so he would apply to be transferred over.

"Don't feel pressured, Zoe. Our family is planning to expand overseas anyway. It isn't just for you," he added for fear that she might turn him down.

When the car pulled up in front of the villa, Zoe was about to step out when Luke suddenly called out to her, "Wait."

He reached out and gently tucked a messy strand of hair behind her ear. His movements were so gentle that it was as if he were handling something fragile.

Zoe instinctively raised her head and froze.

Not far away, a pair of cold, sharp eyes stared straight at her from the top of the stairs. Alder stood there in a suit. His eyes gave off an unspoken air of authority.

Chapter 3
Zoe trembled and quickly turned to Luke to say, "You should leave."

But he didn't notice anything strange and continued, "Once the paperwork is done, you—"

"Please, just leave!" Her voice was tight with tension and almost pleading.

Hearing that, he was briefly startled before finally nodding. "Alright, then. Be careful."

It was only after watching his car drive off that she dared turn around and slowly make her way toward the steps.

Alder remained standing there with his eyes fixed on her. Unreadable emotions swirled in his gaze.

Zoe was practically trembling as her heart thumped in her ears. Was he mad? Would he react like before and chop off someone's hand just because they touched her?

Instead, she heard a cold and distant command. "There's a guest in the house. Make some coffee."

With that, he turned and walked away, the sound of his footsteps slowly fading.

Zoe stood frozen for a long time before she finally had the guts to lift her head.

Alder hadn't shown any reaction at all. It did seem like he'd lost his memory.

She let out a breath of relief before turning to the kitchen to brew some coffee. When she entered the living room with cups of coffee, she noticed the guest.

With one glance, she recognized the guest as Elara, the woman from the news supposedly getting engaged to Alder.

Right now, Arthur, Edith, and Vera were all gathered around her and beaming as they discussed wedding plans. Alder sat aside and listened without a word.

Lowering her head, Zoe walked over and softly said, "Your coffee, Ms. Vance."

Elara looked up at her with a subtle smile tugging at her lips. She reached out to take the cup, only to "accidentally" knock it over. The scalding hot coffee spilled all over her.

Before Zoe could even react, Vera's slap landed on her face. "You did that on purpose, didn't you?"

Zoe opened her mouth and instinctively tried to explain, "It wasn't me…"

But Vera cut her off with a shrill voice and turned to complain to Alder. Pointing at Zoe in disgust, she shrieked, "Alder, look! I've been meaning to tell you that this maid harbors ulterior motives toward you!

"She secretly collects your belongings, so she's clearly not decent! Now that she knows you're marrying Elara, she's gone mad with jealousy and hurt Elara on purpose!"

Zoe stood frozen as her body went cold. She couldn't believe how easily Vera distorted the truth.

"I didn't…" Her voice shook.

But before she could say more, Elara chimed in. Her eyes were red, and her voice was soft and delicate as she said, "Alder, many people will try to hook up with you, considering your status. If you don't make an example of her right now, more will follow."'

Arthur and Edith immediately echoed, "Yes! She must be severely punished!"

As Zoe stood rooted to the spot, realization struck her that this was all an orchestrated play. It was a setup they'd worked together to have her punished. 

And Alder… he hated nothing more than being seduced.

Sure enough, she heard his cold voice say, "Take her out. Punish her under the family law."

With that, he leaned over to scoop Elara into his arms. Then, he headed upstairs without another glance at them. "I'll call the private doctor."

Zoe didn't get the chance to argue before two guards grabbed her by the arms and aggressively dragged her out.

…

Outside, night had fallen.

Vera held up a barbed whip as her face lit up with twisted glee and malice. "You've finally fallen into my hands, Zoe."

She raised the whip and viciously lashed it down. The first strike tore into the skin. "This one's for stealing my identity!"

The second blow ripped the flesh. "This one's for seducing Alder!"

Another blow followed. "This one's for not knowing your place!"

…

"Scream all you want! Why aren't you screaming now? Alder isn't coming to your rescue anymore!" Vera cackled manically.

Zoe bit her lip hard and refused to let a sound escape her throat. But the barbs tore into her skin, and each lash felt like it was ripping her apart.

Blood trickled down her back, arms, and legs, dripping onto the floor.

99 lashes. Vera seemed determined to release years of hatred in one night. The more she whipped, the more frenzied she was.

When it all ended, Zoe was barely conscious. All she could hear were Vera's sharp curses and the sound of the whip tearing through her flesh.

When the final strike landed, her body finally gave out and collapsed into the pool of blood.
