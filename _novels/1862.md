My husband, Dax, had a nasty temper. 
He was constantly belittling me, making me feel worthless. 
My best friend, Chloe, kept pushing me to divorce him, and I actually listened to her. 
I divorced him decisively, even agreeing to leave with practically nothing but Leo.
I never imagined that after the divorce, I wouldn't be able to afford our family expenses.
By the time I swallowed my pride and went back to him, begging for help, I found out he'd married Chloe. 
Chloe had him wrapped around her little finger, happy as a clam, and all his money was flowing straight into her accounts. 
That's when it hit me: Chloe had been after Dax all along, subtly poisoning our relationship.
The betrayal shattered me. I was so heartbroken, I ended up in a car accident.
The next thing I knew, I was opening my eyes again, and it was that exact moment when Chloe was first trying to convince me to divorce Dax. 
I blocked her on SnapChat without a second thought. 
Then, I turned to Dax, who was busy criticizing my outfit, calling it ugly and my taste terrible, and I plastered a sweet smile on my face.
"Darling," I said, "I'll change immediately. Whatever you say."
