My daughter is allergic to peanuts, yet my sister-in-law deceived her into eating something with peanuts.

Without a moment's hesitation, I flagged down a car to rush to the hospital.

In a previous time, when my daughter had an allergic reaction, I called my husband in a panic.

Although he was reluctant, he hurried back from my sister-in-law's graduation ceremony.

Unexpectedly, that night, my sister-in-law was attacked by a criminal and tragically lost her life.

My husband calmly handled her funeral and told me it was just her ill fate.

A year later, on the anniversary of her death, my husband poisoned my food.

As I lay dying, I heard his spiteful words:

"You wicked woman, you made our daughter have an allergic reaction on purpose to stop me from attending my sister's graduation."

"You deserve to die, go and atone for her!"

My daughter and I died with our grievances unresolved.

When I opened my eyes again, I was back on the day of my daughter's allergy incident.
