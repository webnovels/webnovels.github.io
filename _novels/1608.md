It was a weekend, and I was with my wife, Chloe Peterson, at her company party, celebrating her promotion.
When we arrived, her colleagues enthusiastically pulled Chloe away for photos and congratulations, leaving me feeling completely isolated in a corner.
After the photos, Chloe's boss, Mr. Sterling, walked over to me, a drink in his hand.
"What's wrong with you, kid? Are you useless? You've been married to Chloe for so long, and she's still a virgin?"
As he spoke, he gave Chloe's butt a heavy pat.
"Your wife is so hot, and you can't satisfy her. What a damn shame."
I clenched my fists, trying to rein in my fury, and turned to look at Chloe, whose eyes were distant and hazy.
"Chloe, did you really sleep with him?"

At that moment, every single eye in the room landed on me.
My wife hadn't expected me to confront her publicly, and her face instantly dropped.
"Julian, what the hell is wrong with you now? Today is my big promotion day, do you have to make a scene and embarrass everyone?"
I stared her down, my gaze unwavering.
"Chloe, answer my question! Did you or did you not sleep with this old man?!"
My tone clearly struck a nerve. She shoved me hard.
"So what if I did? Julian, we've been married for almost two years, and you haven't even bought me a decent handbag!"
"Look at Mr. Sterling! He just bought me a Hermès bag today."
Chloe was incredibly agitated, spittle almost flying onto my face.
I suppressed the anger bubbling inside me, my eyes locked on her.
"Chloe, do you even realize Mr. Sterling here is almost fifty? He's old enough to be your father!"
I thought that would embarrass her, but she didn't care in the slightest.
"So what if he's old? It's better than being with a loser like you!"
"Mr. Sterling just promised me that as long as I stick by him, the CEO Assistant position will be mine sooner or later."
After saying that, Chloe actually leaned in and kissed her boss right in front of me.
Mr. Sterling's wrinkled face now bore a vibrant lipstick mark from my wife.
"Did you bring me here today just so I could watch you cheat?"
The words were barely out of my mouth when Mr. Sterling, who had been silent for a while, chuckled.
"Kid, are you truly stupid or just faking it? Can't you see such an obvious answer?"
Mid-sentence, he unabashedly pulled my wife into his arms.
"I told her to call you. And the purpose? It's simple: I want you to divorce her!"
I looked up at the two, their fingers intertwined, and let out a cold laugh.
"From the looks of it, you two must have planned this out a long time ago, huh?"
No wonder the moment I walked in, something felt off.
She must have been hooking up with her company's boss for ages.
And it finally made sense why, after all this time married, Chloe never let me touch her. She was saving her first time for her boss.
"Stop wasting my time. Just say if you're divorcing me or not."
Seeing my prolonged silence, Chloe's tone grew impatient.
"Julian, I must have done something awful in a past life to end up with a loser like you."
"If someone hadn't told me your family owned a villa back then, I wouldn't have dated you even if you begged me!"
I paused for a moment, then slowly spoke.
"So you married me because my family had a villa, not because you loved me?"
The moment I finished speaking, Chloe scoffed.
"What else? You didn't seriously think I'd fall for a nerd like you, did you?"
Her words hit me like a physical blow. I was completely stunned.
Everyone at our university knew Chloe had pursued me relentlessly for three years. I only agreed to date her on graduation day.
Though I had no idea how she knew about my family's villa, it didn't matter now.
I wouldn't keep a woman who had cheated.
"Chloe, you're absolutely right. My family does own villas in the West End, and more than just one."
My gaze suddenly sharpened.
"But I regret to inform you that, from this moment on, none of those things have anything to do with you."
My words were met with a burst of laughter from the crowd.
"Knock it off, punk! Don't you dare try to impress me. Do you even know how much a villa in the West End costs? Even our Mr. Sterling can't afford one, and a pathetic loser like you claims to have several? Who are you trying to fool?"
As the employees continued sucking up to their boss, I just offered a faint smile.
"What I said is the truth. Believe it or not, it's up to you."
