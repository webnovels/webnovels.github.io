When the doctor placed the surgical records in front of him, Liam saw his dreams shatter and collapsed onto the floor.

"Didn't we agree? Just write 'termination' on the record, but actually have the child!"

"Ethan, it had to be you! You tricked us! You understood French, so you knew about the will. After I left, you secretly bribed the doctor. How dare you ruin my plans!"

Just as Liam was about to charge at me, I tore the will to pieces and threw them in his face.

The paper fragments fluttered down, just like his shattered dream of wealth.

"Save your energy; you'll need it to take care of her."

With that, I turned and left without looking back.

"What do I do now? My billions!"

"Sophia, wake up!"

"Get up and think of something!"

Liam's wailing behind me was almost laughable. Weren't they supposed to be in love? Why was every word from Liam's mouth only about money?

I had no time for this drama. There's a tough battle waiting for me back home.

Since Liam's return, he's overhauled the company's staff, inserting many of their people. Operations are in chaos, and the stock keeps plummeting. I have to intervene.

Back at Johnson Corporation, rumors were already spreading. They said Sophia and I secretly divorced, which is why Liam took over the company recently. As for me, I could be kicked out at any time, and those who support me would be cleared out too.

These rumors were undoubtedly orchestrated by Sophia and Liam. Failing to use the child to oust me, they now want to use public pressure.

It's not going to be that easy.

I identified several key figures spreading rumors and fired them, regardless of their position. I also rehired a few confidants who had been forced out under Liam's pressure.

With the staff cleaned up, I immediately called an emergency shareholders meeting.

Exhausted after dealing with everything, I finally had time to go home, only to run into Sophia at the door.

"Long time no see. I didn't expect you'd change the locks."

Sophia spoke first, clearly with ill intentions.

"But you didn't change our mom's nursing home location, did you?"

Sophia waved her phone in front of me. It was a photo of her and my mom.
