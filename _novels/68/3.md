With two months left until the due date, Sophia eagerly moved into a private hospital. Since she didn't want any record of her having a child for the Liam family, she devised a foolproof plan.

Not only did she have me, her nominal husband, accompany her, but she also paid a hefty sum to bribe the doctor to alter the medical records.

She changed the pregnancy period to four months and the type of surgery from a natural birth to an induction.

With this switcheroo, even if I eventually confronted her or if a business rival dug up this dirt, she could claim this child was ours, but it was aborted due to poor development.

As for the child in her womb, it really was developing poorly. The doctor said it was a Down syndrome child and advised against giving birth.

But Sophia stubbornly chose to do the opposite, saying a child with an intellectual disability would be easier to manipulate.

She needed a piece that would allow her to reap the benefits effortlessly.

She always treated me like a pawn, but how could I let her manipulate me any longer?

I looked at the altered surgical application form and silently clenched my fists.

I decided to respect the doctor's advice and not let the child come into this world.

"Ethan, your French isn't good, so you'll need to use a translator to communicate with the doctors and make sure the surgery process is correct. Don't mess it up!"

Before entering the operating room, Sophia kept emphasizing to me.

"I got it. I'll communicate well with the doctor. You just go in and relax."

Maybe my calm tone aroused her suspicion.

"Ethan, you'd better remember. If anything happens to me or the child, I won't let you off easily!"

Even at this point, she didn't forget to threaten me.

I had already confirmed the procedure with the doctors. They all agreed with my decision, and considering Sophia's extreme personality, the child had inherent defects. If born, it would only be used by Sophia and then discarded.

Rather than let that happen, I could stop the tragedy now.

From the ward came Sophia's heart-wrenching screams.

"What did you inject me with? Why do I feel like the child isn't moving?"

She tried to get up but was anesthetized and could only lie on the bed.

"Ethan, get in here and tell the doctors the child must survive!"

"Ethan, even if I cheated and had a child for another man, you can't do this to me. You're my husband, and you must witness this child's birth!"

Sophia yelled for me from the ward, but I found it noisy and left, going further away.

Just as I reached the first floor, I ran into Liam, who had rushed over.

"Where's the child, my child?"

"You, what exactly did you inject me with? I can't feel the baby moving anymore!"

She tried to get up but was sedated and could only remain on the bed.

"Ethan, come in here! You have to tell the doctor that the baby has to survive!"

"Ethan, even if I was unfaithful and had a child with someone else, you can't treat me like this. You're my husband, you need to be here for the birth of this child!"

Sophia was calling me from the hospital room, but the noise was overwhelming, so I stepped out to get some distance.

Unexpectedly, as soon as I reached the first floor, I ran into Liam, who had arrived in a hurry.

"Where is the child, where is my child?!"

In his haste, Liam hadn't properly concealed what he was carrying. It was the will established by the old patriarch of the Anderson family years ago.

Through recent conversations between Sophia and Liam, I finally realized I had been ensnared in a massive scheme from the start.

Back then, the old man of the Anderson family knew his daughter was unreliable, so he wanted to find someone to help manage the family business. He orchestrated a plan for Sophia to deliberately win over my family’s favor and secure my goodwill, while also setting up an ironclad will. No matter how I developed the company, the profits would always belong to the Anderson family.

But it seems his plans are about to unravel now.

"The child has already been terminated."

I smiled with a hint of detachment.

Hearing this, Liam completely lost control.

"You deceived me, didn’t you? The child was fine; it must have been born already!"

Liam lunged to grab my collar. I snatched the documents from his hand and pulled him upstairs.

"See for yourself!"

When we got upstairs, Sophia had already been wheeled out, unconscious, with no child beside her. This sent Liam into a complete frenzy.

He urgently pulled the doctor aside to ask.

"Where's the child? Which room was it sent to?"

"The child has been dealt with according to your instructions. Here are the surgical records, and here's the signed family consent."
