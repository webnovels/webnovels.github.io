"Sophia, you'd better explain clearly what happened to our child."

I turned and demanded answers from Sophia.

Liam, who was still on the ground, quickly attempted to cover for his words.

"Ah, I misspoke... I meant miscarriage. I was trying to say Sophia can't have another miscarriage; it's bad for her health."

I never thought Liam, a man, could be so duplicitous.

Besides, I had met him before, and he wasn't like this.

"I don't want to hide it from you. I did abort the child. Liam's father is critically ill, and I wanted to have a child for Liam to continue their family line and give the old man some hope. How can you have no empathy?"

Sophia's words made me laugh out of anger.

So she was overflowing with empathy, rushing to have a child for someone else?

"Don't give me that moral high ground nonsense, making cheating sound so noble! Just one thing, I want you back home for a divorce!"

As soon as I mentioned divorce, Liam's eyes lit up.

Sure enough, a homewrecker always wants to ascend, regardless of gender.

He had deliberately let me know about Sophia's abortion to provoke a divorce between us, didn't he?

"You're just bothered that the child isn't yours, right? After I have Liam's child, I'll give you one. If we end up divorcing, you'll have to leave Anderson Corporation, so what's in it for you?"

I underestimated Sophia's shamelessness.

She even threatened me with that tone.

She doesn't know that Anderson Corporation has been a shell since her father passed away.

If it wasn't for my investment and takeover, it would've gone bankrupt long ago.

But she did remind me, after all my hard work, why should I make it easy for others by getting a divorce now?

So I pretended to soften my stance, wanting to hear Sophia's plan to have a child for someone else abroad.

"I can avoid divorce, but you have to take care of this child!"

"Don't worry about the child. I'll find a private hospital to give birth, and there won't be any record. But you'll have to be the one to sign off on the surgery. So for the time being, let Liam return home to manage the company while you take care of me until the birth."

Hearing her plan, I couldn't help but take a deep breath.

She intended to keep me informed until the child was too far along to be aborted, and I'd be the one to care for her during labor. Meanwhile, Liam would return home under the guise of managing the company for me, effectively sidelining me.

What a plan to discard the donkey after exploiting it!

"Don't worry, you're still my husband. Liam is just helping take over temporarily; nothing will go wrong."

Sophia made it sound so reassuring.

"Alright, it seems like the best plan now, but you have to promise I can return to the company immediately after you give birth."

I turned and gave advice to my confidant at the company back home. Once Liam arrives, they'll be sure to treat him well.

With Liam gone, Sophia continued nurturing her fetus in France.

But every day, she would spend a long time on the balcony, talking on the phone.

"What are you chattering about out there every day?"

I pretended not to understand her.

"Just talking to some friends in France."

After testing several times and thinking I really didn't understand, Sophia openly started speaking in French on the phone with Liam in front of me.

"Liam, it's alright if he deliberately makes things hard for you at the company. Just hang in there; everything will be fine after the baby is born."

"Remember my grandfather's will? All of Anderson family's entire estate will go to my first child."

Sophia's words were laced with malice, as if she was already planning to discard me once she was done using me.

What she didn't know was that I had already learned French to find her.

I understood every word she said these days.

After all, knowing your enemy is the key to victory.

She has her tricks, and I have my plans.
