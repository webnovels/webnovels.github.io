I grabbed my wife Sophia's arm, fury boiling over.

"You said you came to France to further your studies, but it seems you were studying in bed!"

I glared at Sophia's belly. We had been apart for a year, so this child couldn't possibly be anyone else's but Liam's.

The two of them were stunned by my sudden appearance, looking at me in disbelief.

"Ethan, since you know everything, there's no point in hiding it. The child is indeed Liam's."

"Bro, actually, Sophia knew my mom wanted a grandchild, but I'm not interested in marriage. She just wanted to help me. This is our IVF child, and we're innocent."

Despite my shock, they quickly put on a show of innocence.

Ha, the way they were hugging and kissing was far from innocent!

"Ethan, we're married, and you should understand me. I can't handle any major emotional upheaval now that I'm pregnant. Let's settle everything after the baby's born."

Her words made me laugh in disbelief.

So, she was having a child for someone else, and I not only couldn't be angry, but I had to be understanding and supportive? Sorry, I can't accept that.

"Sophia, I don't even want to be with you anymore, so why would I protect your child?"

I looked at her, my tone unwavering.

To Sophia, all she saw was jealousy.

"No matter what you say, I won't abort this child just because you're jealous!"

Hearing this, Liam immediately dropped to his knees in front of me.

He crawled a few steps forward, keeping his head very low.

"Brother Ethan, please don't make Sister Sophia abort the child. She's quite far along, and an abortion would be harmful to her."

Liam whispered to me, in a voice only I could hear, delivering a truly cutting remark.

"Sophia already aborted the last pregnancy to have this child. If she aborts again, she might never be able to have children."

Last pregnancy? Aborted?

Those words left me momentarily speechless with rage.

Sophia had told me our last child was an accidental miscarriage. At that time, I said I would drop everything to be with her, but she insisted I complete my project, saying she also wanted to study abroad and relax.

Not only did I comply with her wishes, but I also transferred millions to her out of guilt.

Turns out she intentionally aborted the child just to make room to have a child for another man?

How am I supposed to swallow this?
