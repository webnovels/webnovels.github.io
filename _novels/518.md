During a live stream, someone sent me a hundred expensive gifts.
Their only request was to watch me eat in person.
When they arrived, I realized they weren't alone.
There was also a handsome guy with a pale face and an extremely thin build.
The beautiful lady took out a thick red envelope.
"If you can get him to take just one bite, this $1,500 is yours."
I didn't know severe anorexia existed in this world.
I methodically ate all the food on the table.
Finally, I licked my lips and looked longingly at the steak in front of him.
"I... I'm still hungry. If you're not going to eat it, can I have it...?"
His pupils trembled, and his bony hand pressed down on the plate.
