I directly let Lydia move into the Wang house instead of next door.

My mother-in-law was indeed pleased.

Affectionately holding Lydia's hand.

"Oh my, with those childbearing hips, you're bound to have sons! If all six are boys, I'll be over the moon every day!"

I showed no suspicion, pretending to know nothing every day.

Whatever BFF wanted to eat, I'd make it, acting like a fool eager to be the child's godmother.

No matter how Lydia and Nolan flirted in private.

Every time they slept, I'd get up to select a shelter.

Calculating, the Ice Age Apocalypse was just half a month away.

Looking at the million-dollar dowry my father left me, I decided to use it to build a comfortable, warm shelter.

First, I chose the apocalypse survival location in the old family bunker.

That bunker, now abandoned, once saved the whole village.

Built by a famous returning architect at the time.

I just needed to spend money on upgrades to turn it into an upgraded bunker.

I contacted my cousin still in the village to help with this.

Cousin was puzzled, "You're living well in the city, why think of the village bunker, that place is quite dilapidated now."

Seeing I didn't want to reveal much, Cousin didn't press, just added with concern.

"If things aren't good in the city, coming back to the village is fine too. If you're wronged, tell your cousin."

My eyes welled up.

In the past, my mother-in-law often ridiculed me for having rural relatives.

Mocking me as a wild chicken trying to perch high.

But my family wasn't poor; my dad was the first in the village to attend a prestigious university, getting a decent job after graduation, where he met my mom.

Unfortunately, a car accident took them away.

Growing up, I misjudged people, failing to see Nolan's mama's boy nature.

After marriage, my mother-in-law often checked my phone, fearing I'd use family money to aid my family.

Little did she know, our village had long prospered.

Conditions were quite good.

"Where are you sneaking off to make calls, is it some poor relative looking to leech off us?"

Mother-in-law stood behind me, face dark.

Nolan grumbled, "Mom said no using our money for poor relatives, do you even care about my mom!"

I lowered myself, smiling apologetically.

"No, I was asking another family's babysitter about making soup for Lydia."

They half-believed, and the matter passed.

I sneered inside.

The Wang family might have some money, but it's all from rental income.

That's why Lydia got involved with Nolan.

Willing to bear his kids.

But soon, their little money would be worthless.

In the Ice Age Apocalypse, only food and water were precious.

Money would just be worthless paper.

I'll never forget past grievances.

I'll slowly plot, letting these three receive what's due.

By then, I'll be in the upgraded bunker, living well.

As for them, they'll face a dog-eat-dog world!
