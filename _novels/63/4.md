Cousin was exceptionally attentive to my matters.

In just ten days, he finished renovating the bunker.

Next was equipping the bunker.

The Ice Age Apocalypse will cause power outages in most areas.

I bought three generators: a diesel generator, portable, providing stable power output, needing regular maintenance and fuel replacement.

A solar generator, converting sunlight to electricity, emitting no harmful gases, not consuming diesel, but has obvious drawbacks, heavily weather-dependent, unusable at night.

A pedaling generator, only needing manpower, but its power output is small.

So, the primary one is the diesel generator.

I purchased a large amount of diesel, ensuring three months' supply, with the bunker being ideal for diesel storage.

With power sorted, next was food and water.

I first bought essential appliances, like a frying pan and rice cooker, minimizing electric product purchases to prevent excessive consumption.

I prepared a hundred pounds of rice, flour, and oil, and bought hundreds of boxes of instant noodles of various flavors.

As for water, I decided to buy a purifier. In the apocalyptic cold, outside is a snowy world, water isn't lacking.

Firstly, pure water bottles take up too much space, and secondly, saved space can create a vegetable hydroponic area.

Self-sufficiency, no need for a fridge, saving space and power.

I bought seeds for cabbage, spinach, cilantro, tomatoes, and bok choy.

For meat, I could only buy lots of military rations, enough for three months.

Other than that, just some snacks I like and daily necessities.

Having solved the food problem, there's still clothing.

I purchased down jackets and snow boots worth thousands, advertised as suitable even for Antarctica.

Next, medicine.

Especially vitamin tablets.

In apocalyptic times, lacking fruit for long periods causes vitamin deficiency, leading to scurvy.

Without timely treatment, one could die from fever, swelling, and paralysis.

Living alone in the bunker, I mustn’t fall ill.

After completing all this, the weather grew colder.

Mother-in-law often nagged in my ear.

"Always running out, who's going to care for your BFF with her big belly, are you expecting this old woman to do it?"

I couldn't help but talk back, quietly making meals for the three.

BFF lounged on the sofa watching TV, more like the hostess than me.

"I want some fruit, make me a nice fruit platter, it'll cheer me up if it looks good."

My gaze turned cold.

"The apples on the table are washed, you can eat them directly."

Lydia glanced at Nolan, seemingly wanting to reveal the secret.

The weather had turned much colder by the time all this was over.

My mother-in-law would often nag at me.

"You're always out and about. Who's going to look after your pregnant friend? Surely you don't expect me, an old woman, to do it!"

I couldn't help but retort, all the while quietly preparing food for the three of them.

My friend was lounging on the couch watching TV, looking more like the lady of the house than me.

"I feel like having some fruit. Make me a nice-looking fruit platter. I'll only feel good if it looks good."

I gave her a frosty look.

"The apples on the table are already washed. You can eat them as they are."

Lydia glanced at Nolan, as if she was eager to spill a secret.

Last night, I secretly checked Nolan's phone and saw the advice he had given her.

My mom said not to tell her about us just yet. Just treat her like a free maid. If she refuses to do chores, make her feel guilty.

Lydia immediately put on a sorrowful face.

"Nora, you were the one who invited me to stay at your place. Are you annoyed with me now? It's normal for a pregnant woman to have cravings."

At this, my mother-in-law spoke up.

"Exactly, you were the one who said Lydia could stay with us. My son and I, the real hosts, have no issue with it. So why do you?"

Ha, what I had originally suggested was for her to stay next door. It was your idea for her to move in.

If I had known the child Lydia is carrying was Nolan's, I wouldn't have cared about her well-being at all.

I smiled.

"Alright, just hold on a moment. I'll make the fruit platter now."
