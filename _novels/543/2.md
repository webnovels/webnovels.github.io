I returned to the mansion. As expected, Ethan was there.

Olivia was nestled in Ethan's arms, her face still flushed.

Seeing me return, Olivia immediately stood up and walked towards me.

Slap!

The sound of a slap rang out as Olivia coldly looked at me and said,

"Jack, so you finally decided to come back?"

"Now get on your knees and apologize to Ethan!"

"Let me tell you, Ethan is being generous. After you apologize, he's willing to let the past go, considering you've been by my side for a few years."

"So hurry up! Ethan and I have plans later. Don't waste our time!"

Olivia's voice was full of disgust, as if what she was saying was some kind of favor to me.

I ignored her. From the moment this woman locked me in that basement, any love I had for her began to fade away.

I looked at Ethan sitting on the couch and said to him,

"Looks like you're feeling pretty confident now?"

"Why wouldn't I be?" Ethan took a sip of his red wine and said mockingly,

"Your so-called friends were only interested in the benefits you could bring them. I can offer more."

"Olivia never loved you. She only saw you as my replacement. But now I'm back."

With each sentence, Ethan took a step towards me. He came close, patted my face, and said,

"As for family, you're just an orphan whose parents are dead."

"I won't make things difficult for you. Just kneel down, apologize to me, sign the divorce papers, and you can get lost."

Having said this, he sat back down on the couch, swirling his wine glass, looking at me with a victorious smile.

I took a deep breath, suppressing my anger. The doctor had warned me not to get upset before I could go abroad for treatment, or it might worsen my condition.

If that happened, I might...

"Ethan, I'll sign the divorce papers, but I won't apologize!"

As soon as I finished speaking, a shrill voice came from behind me.

"Jack! Who do you think you are to refuse to apologize?!"

Olivia looked crazed, a sight that filled me with sadness. She had never been like this for me.

She came up to me and slapped me again.

I didn't say anything. When she tried to slap me a third time, I caught her hand.

Olivia's eyes widened in shock. She glared at me and said,

"You! You dare to stop me!!!"

I looked at her coldly and said,

"Why wouldn't I dare to stop you?"

"After that last slap, any feelings between us are completely over."

"From now on, we have no connection whatsoever."

"I hope you won't bother me again in the future."

"There's still a week left in the divorce cooling-off period. I'll sign the agreement after seven days."

With that, I turned and left the mansion.

Olivia stood there, stunned by my words.

When she came to her senses, her face twisted in anger. She turned to Ethan and said through gritted teeth,

"Ethan, I want him to pay!"

Ethan narrowed his eyes, staring at the direction I had left.

"Don't worry, Olivia. He will."
