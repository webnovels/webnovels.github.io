Over the next two days, I moved all my belongings out of the mansion and into the house my parents had left me.

Olivia and Ethan didn't cause me any more trouble after that day, but someone I never expected came to see me.

"Jack, long time no see."

I looked at the woman standing outside my door, a hint of nostalgia in my eyes.

"How did you find me?"

Luna, Olivia's half-sister.

Our fathers had been close friends, and Luna and I had known each other since childhood. Five years ago, she went abroad, and I hadn't seen her since.

Luna chuckled and said,

"I've heard everything. Looks like the five years I've been gone haven't been kind to you."

"How did you...!"

I looked at her in surprise, then shook my head resignedly.

Of course, my issues with Olivia had become known to everyone around us. With Luna's connections, it wouldn't be hard for her to find out.

"Weren't you abroad? Why did you suddenly come back?"

Hearing my question, Luna rolled her eyes at me and said,

"If I hadn't come back, you might really be dead by now."

She looked at me reproachfully.

"Do you know how many forms I had to fill out to bring you the special medication? It was such a hassle."

I stared at her in shock and asked,

"How did you know about my illness?!"

She pushed past me into the house and said,

"The doctor who diagnosed you is my senior from medical school. He contacted me earlier saying there was a late-stage stomach cancer patient here and asked if I could take over the case. I looked into it and found out it was you."

"I heard you and my sister still have a week left in your divorce cooling-off period. So, I rushed back from abroad to avoid delaying your treatment."

Luna sat on the couch, spreading her hands and looking at me.

Hearing what she said, I wanted to thank her, but when I opened my mouth, no sound came out.

Seeing me like this, she came over to me, gently caressing my face, her voice soft.

"Don't thank me. If it weren't for you reaching out to help me when the Yus were in trouble back then, the Yu family would be long gone by now."

"From that moment on, I swore in my heart that I would always stand by your side. It's a pity you ended up choosing Olivia in the end."

"I..."

She cut me off and continued,

"But now my chance has come. So, for my sake, please live on."

Even if I had a thousand things to say, in the end, they all condensed into one sentence.

"I promise you."

I looked into Luna's eyes and said firmly.

Then I remembered something and told her,

"By the way, I left something back at the mansion. I need to go get it. Wait for me here."

...

When I returned to the mansion, Olivia and Ethan weren't there. I didn't think much of it and went straight to my room.

But the moment I opened the door, I lost consciousness.

When I opened my eyes again, darkness surrounded me. That familiar feeling of fear instantly washed over me like a tidal wave.

My heart started racing, and cold sweat soaked through my clothes in an instant.

I immediately felt around, hoping to find the door, but after groping for a while, I realized that I was surrounded by walls on all sides!

The fear grew stronger and stronger, and I could feel my strength slowly leaving my body. I started pounding on the walls like a madman.

I'd rather die from cancer than in this pitch-black space.

Blood ran down my face, my fists were raw to the bone from hitting the walls, and due to the extreme stress, the blood vessels in my eyes burst, causing me to cry tears of blood.

But still, no one came. I screamed and shouted until my voice became hoarse, until... I could no longer make a sound.

At that moment, I understood. It was Olivia and Ethan.

They wanted me dead, but they couldn't kill me themselves.

But who would care about a terminally ill cancer patient who accidentally fell into an abandoned well?

Yes, I was at the bottom of an abandoned well, with a stone slab pressed on top.

I curled up at the bottom of the well, like a dying maggot, slowly being consumed by fear.

One day, two days, three days...

My consciousness was slowly fading. In my delirium, I thought I heard Luna's voice.

"I'm sorry, Luna. I broke my promise..."
