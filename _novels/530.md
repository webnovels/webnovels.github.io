Marcus doesn't love me or our daughter. Yet he's fallen madly in love with Lily's dance teacher.

He spent a fortune buying a luxurious mansion to keep her as his mistress. His love for her is no secret.

The dance teacher came to see me, revealing the red marks on her body.

"I'm so sorry, I never meant to be the other woman," she said tearfully. "But he won't let me go. Please help me leave the country."

In a moment of weakness, I agreed to help her escape.

Marcus went berserk.

He strapped a bomb to our daughter. "Tell me where Melody is or I'll blow her up right in front of you."

I broke down sobbing and quickly told him Melody's location.

After he left, a timer appeared on the bomb strapped to Lily.

Beep...beep...beep...

I rushed over without thinking. The blast threw me backwards.

My daughter's body exploded into a bloody mist, painting the world red.

"No!" I screamed.

When I opened my eyes again, I was back on the day I discovered Marcus was keeping a mistress.
