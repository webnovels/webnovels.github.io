Liam took me to one of his private clubs.

It used to be my favorite.

The penthouse suite was incredibly luxurious.

Pushing the door open, I found people already inside.

In the dim light, their faces weren't clear, but the room's atmosphere was intoxicatingly intimate.

Someone on the sofa exhaled a cloud of smoke, a girl nestled close to him, their heads together, her soft laughter floating through the air.

People at the card table also had various girls around them.

When my friends and I used to come here, they'd always have girls with them too.

For them, those girls were just commodities, part of a transaction.

The girls had their own motives, so they willingly played their part.

And now, wasn’t I doing the same?

The person on the sofa recognized me and quickly made space. The people at the card table also gathered around.

“Mr. Shen, a rare visit!”

“The sun must have risen from the west today, our Mr. Shen actually brought a lady!”

“Won’t your little darling Skylar cry her eyes out, Mr. Shen?”

“I’ll text your little darling Skylar right now and tell her to come catch you in the act.”

As they chatted and laughed, I remained silent, trying to make myself as invisible as possible.

Liam picked up a cigarette from the table and lit it, the tip glowing and fading.

Noticing his bad mood, the others quickly changed the subject.

“Mr. Shen, you finally came out to play. Let’s play, let’s play, no more boring talk.”

“Let’s play ‘Beauty’s Gambit.’ Perfect, since we all have ladies tonight.”

“What do you think, Mr. Shen? You wouldn’t be too attached to your pretty companion, would you?”

Hearing their words, I cast a pleading look at Liam.

Beauty’s Gambit was a cruel game these rich guys made up. The bet? The ‘beauties’ themselves. They’d play cards, and whoever lost, their female companion had to take off a piece of clothing until there was nothing left.

My pleading gaze met his calm, deep pupils, still and unmoving like ancient water.

The atmosphere turned instantly dead silent.

After a long moment, Liam sneered.

“Fine.”

My heart instantly felt like it was pierced by needles, a searing pain spreading through my limbs.

Everyone, having heard Liam’s answer, had already moved to the card table.

Liam and I remained on the sofa, unmoving.

Liam leaned closer, his warm breath ghosting over my ear.

“Didn’t Miss Wen say she’d do anything?”

His dark, shining eyes watched me, a hint of playful malice dancing within them.

“Mr. Shen, still whispering sweet nothings to your beauty? Come on over!”

The people at the card table had already shuffled the cards, calling out to Liam.

Liam took my hand and walked toward the table.

As we reached the card table, the dim lights suddenly became blinding.

The sofa area had been a lounge, so the lighting was deliberately soft, but the card table was brightly lit. I squinted my eyes slightly.

“You… Miss Wen, what are you doing here?”

Suddenly, a shocked male voice rang out.

The others at the card table heard him and all turned their gaze toward me. Among them were faces I found familiar.

The looks directed at me were a mix of curiosity and surprise.

The atmosphere at the card table instantly became exceptionally tense.

And the girls around them began to whisper.

“Miss Wen? Who’s Miss Wen?”

Daniel was certain he hadn't mistaken me.

Who was Miss Wen?

Aria Wen, the former heiress of the Wen family, was once the most dazzling red rose in the entire city.

Aria had a signature red tear mole under her right eye, and it had been a sensation across the city. Every girl wanted one, drawing red tear moles under their own eyes.

She was also Liam’s teenage sweetheart.

Liam’s company had stormed the city, skyrocketing to the top in just five years.

During that time, he had searched for Aria countless times, sparing no expense.

This was no longer a secret in the city’s high society.

But about their story, Daniel had heard several versions.

Some said Aria had cheated on him, breaking Liam’s heart, and he was searching for her to get revenge.

Others said Liam still had feelings for her.

Daniel couldn't be sure which was true.

Liam pulled me into his arms, wrapping an arm around my shoulders, his gaze sweeping over the various expressions on everyone’s faces.

“What Miss Wen? The Wen family went bankrupt ages ago, didn’t they?”

Liam pulled me down onto a seat at the card table, tapping the surface.

“Why are you all frozen? Deal the cards.”
