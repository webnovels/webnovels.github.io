On the first day of freshman orientation, I happily arrived with some local specialties, eager to share them with my new roommates. However, I never expected that right after introducing myself, the three roommates would suddenly push me out the door, adamantly refusing to share a room with me.

They even took the issue straight to our resident advisor.

The RA had no choice but to quickly arrange a new room for me.

But as soon as I reached the doorway of my new room, before I could even push my luggage inside, I faced fierce resistance from these new roommates as well.

They wouldn't even let me through the door, claiming they would rather drop out of college than live in the same room as me.

I was utterly baffled, thinking someone must have said something bad about me.

But I had never offended anyone, and after scouring our class SnapChat group, the university forums, and confession pages, I couldn't find any gossip about me.

When I asked other classmates, they would chat with me normally at first, but as soon as they heard I might become their roommate, their expressions would instantly change.

Yet no one would tell me why.
