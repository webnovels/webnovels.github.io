11:00 AM. That’s when HR let me go.
The official reason? A "major project failure" requiring a scapegoat. I didn’t argue. By 11:10 AM, I’d finished the full handover, computer still running. I exited every work group and blocked my manager and all my colleagues.
That afternoon, an ex-coworker contacted me via a burner account, begging me to take a call. They said the director was authorizing a $100,000 bonus. I just smiled. The real trouble I’d set was ten minutes from detonation.

01
The HR office was a cage of corporate sterility. The venetian blinds sliced the sunlight into sharp blades of white light, and the air hung thick with the sickly sweet perfume of toner and cheap corporate panic.
“Sloan Kennedy, regarding the critical data interface anomaly on the project, the company has, after careful deliberation, decided…”
Brenda, the HR manager, her lips permanently painted that lifeless mauve, kept talking, but I tuned her out. My focus was on the pathetic, near-dead pothos plant behind her desk. Its leaves were sickly yellow, wilting. Just like me, a consumable asset in this gilded cage.
Garrett Powell, the director, stood beside Brenda, arms crossed, trying to look appropriately grim. He sighed, the sound heavy and performative, like it was squeezed out of him.
“Sloan, it’s not that I don’t value you, but the impact here is too significant. The investors are breathing down our necks; we have to show accountability. You… well, you’re still young. Chalk it up as a lesson learned.”
I finally raised my eyes, meeting Garrett’s gaze calmly, cutting right past Brenda. In those calculating eyes, beneath the veneer of false sympathy, I saw it: triumph and massive relief. He was rid of me.
“Understood.”
Three words. No defense, no argument, not a hint of emotion. My chilling calm seemed to choke off the rest of the script they’d clearly rehearsed.
Brenda blinked, then mechanically slid the termination notice and the severance agreement across the desk. “Well, then… just sign here, and we can start the handover process.”
I picked up the pen and signed my name with a flourish, the signature steady and unbroken.
Walking out of that office, the open-plan floor felt unnaturally quiet. Dozens of eyes—some pitying, some curious, some gleeful—pricked at me like invisible needles, desperate to gauge my emotional state.
I felt the gaze of Cassandra “Cassie” Bell, the senior manager, particularly sticky and triumphant, like a snake coiled on my back. The barely perceptible smirk on her face, harsh under the fluorescent lights, was a punch to the gut. She was the one who had taken the mess she created and expertly packaged it as my "major failure."
I walked straight to my desk. It was a corner fortress, cluttered with technical books and code references—my only sanctuary in this entire high-rise. Now, that fortress was being dismantled.
Ignoring the silent audience, I sat down and got to work. I opened my laptop and started a new document: “Project Handoff.” My fingers flew across the keyboard, the rhythmic clack a sharp, clean sound in the silence.
Logins, passwords, server paths, testing environments… Everything they would need, the non-essential stuff, I documented clearly and categorized meticulously.
Except for the one crucial thing. The perfect going-away gift I’d engineered for them.
Liv Chen, my apprentice, a nervous recent grad in the cube next to me, watched with teary eyes, her lips trembling. I gave her a small, reassuring look: don’t move.
11:09 AM. I finished the last word and emailed the Handoff document to Garrett, copying the entire project team and HR.
Subject line: [Sloan Kennedy - Handoff - 10/27/2023].
11:10 AM. I stood up. Everything on the desk belonged to the company—the computer, the monitors, the keyboard, even the half-dead succulent. The only thing that was mine was a black mug that read “Hello World.”
I picked it up. It was still warm.
As the entire office stared, stunned and confused by my efficiency, I turned and walked toward the exit. No scene, no tears, not even a wave goodbye. In ten minutes, I had completed a textbook-perfect exit, surgically removing myself from their ecosystem.
The elevator doors slid shut, sealing me off from the prying eyes. I leaned against the cold metal, pulling out my phone.
I opened my messaging app, found the “Project Warriors (28)” group, and hit Exit Group. “Tech Department Banter (54)”—Exit. “Corporate Softball League (15)”—Exit.
Then, I went to my contacts: “Garrett Powell - Director”—Block. “Cassie Bell - Senior Manager”—Block. “Brenda - HR”—Block.
One by one, expressionless, I tossed every single corporate contact into the digital trash heap.
Finishing, I felt a fraction of the suffocating feeling of being betrayed and slandered finally lift from my chest.
The screen lit up: 11:15 AM. My lock screen showed a simple countdown widget I’d installed.
[T-minus 2 hours, 45 minutes until the 2 PM Investor Demo.]
I looked at the cold numbers and, for the first and only time all morning, a subtle, cold curve touched the corner of my mouth.
Garrett. Cassie. You thought kicking the "stumbling block" out of the way meant you could coast to the finish line? The overture is over.
02
I didn’t go home. Instead, I crossed the street to an artisanal coffee shop. I snagged a window seat, letting the warm, gentle sunlight chase away the building’s stale chill.
“What can I get for you?”
“A pour-over Geisha, please. Black.”
I ordered the most expensive coffee on the menu. A proper toast to my imminent, absolute freedom.
The barista worked methodically. The water hit the grounds, blooming them, and an intoxicating, complex aroma filled the air. It was pure. Unlike the complicated cocktail of cigar smoke, cologne, and political ambition that perpetually clung to Garrett’s office.
My phone vibrated softly. It was an incoming message from an unfamiliar cartoon avatar: “It’s me, Liv. Your apprentice.”
I accepted the request.
Immediately, her messages poured in, shaking with barely contained fury. “They are absolutely vile, Sloan! You barely walked out the door before Garrett sent a message to the group!”
A screenshot followed. It was the "Project Warriors" group I’d just left. Garrett’s profile picture hovered above a self-congratulatory block of text: “The recent issue has been addressed, and the core vulnerability has been completely neutralized. Thank you to Sloan for her cooperation, which proves our error correction mechanism is effective. Chin up, everyone. The afternoon demo must be a success!”
Below that, Cassie had added a pumping fist emoji and a line: “Brilliant, Garrett! So glad we caught that in time!”
Followed by a few lukewarm "Roger that" and "Way to go, boss" replies from the rest of the team.
I could practically see Garrett’s smug, self-satisfied face. Neutralized the vulnerability?
I almost laughed out loud. They'd just kicked the fire marshal out of the burning building and were now congratulating themselves on putting out the flames. The sheer audacity was staggering.
The phone vibrated again. Liv’s text: “They’re saying the handover document you left was incredibly clear. Garrett even ‘praised’ you publicly for your ‘professionalism and attitude.’ I’m going to throw up.”
I picked up the Geisha, blew on the surface, and took a careful sip. The coffee’s citrus and floral notes exploded in my mouth—sharp, acidic, with a slow, rich finish.
Clear? Of course it was clear. I had made the irrelevant parts—the stuff they could eventually figure out—painfully transparent. It was like handing them an instruction manual for a complex machine, where I meticulously detailed how to turn it on, but omitted the critical chapter on how to prevent it from self-destructing.
My mind drifted back a week. Late Friday night. I was alone, running a final code review ahead of the system stress test. That’s when I found it: the logical flaw, buried deep in the foundational database architecture.
It was insidious. It wouldn’t trigger under normal load. But at a specific time—between 1:50 PM and 2:00 PM—if the system hit high-intensity stress from over ten thousand concurrent requests, it would trigger a catastrophic, irreversible, chain-reaction data deletion. All linked tables, wiped clean instantly, beyond conventional recovery.
A cold sweat broke out on my neck. That project was the company’s lifeblood. The major investor was arriving the following Friday at 2 PM for the final demonstration. And the full-link stress test was scheduled to begin at 1:40 PM.
It was a ticking time bomb, set with chilling precision.
I immediately wrote an emergency fix proposal and a detailed bug analysis.
Monday morning, I was about to send the report to Garrett when Cassie rushed up, looking frantic, holding her coffee.
“Sloan, fire in the hole! The user profile module I’m running is totally borked. The data is all over the place. Could you please take a look?”
Cassie had been at the company longer than me. Her technical skills were mediocre, but she was a master of corporate politics and was tight with Garrett. Seeing her genuinely panicked, I agreed without thinking.
The issue was simple—she'd confused a parameter in an API call. I spent less than thirty minutes fixing it and handed her the solution. She practically groveled in thanks and rushed off.
I didn’t realize I’d just handed her the very knife she would plunge into my back.
That afternoon, Garrett called me into his office. He slammed a printed report on the desk: “Report on Major Data Vulnerability in Project User Module.”
In the report, Cassie had leveraged her minor screw-up, exaggerated it, and dressed it up as a "catastrophic vulnerability" that could have derailed the entire project. Then, using cleverly falsified communication logs and code submission timestamps, she had strongly implied the "vulnerability" was a mistake I made during the final code integration.
I was stunned. I tried to explain, but Garrett cut me off, emphasizing that the project was too close to launch to risk any instability. Someone had to be accountable for this "major risk." He looked at me like I was a piece of trash he was finally authorized to throw out.
Now I understand. Garrett had always resented my technical ability, even as he depended on me for the core work. He wanted me gone so he could claim all the credit for himself. Cassie's lie was the perfect excuse he’d been dreaming of.
They thought by eliminating the one person who knew too much and firing their way to an "unblemished" project, they had secured their perfect trophy.
They had, in fact, just stripped the entire project of its only fuse. My actual, critical fix for the real ticking time bomb was still sitting in the draft folder on my personal laptop.
“Sloan? Are you there?” Liv’s message snapped me back.
I tapped a quick reply. “Don’t worry. Just watch the show.”
I set my phone face down. My wrist watch read 1:40 PM.
The gentle jazz music played on in the café. Outside, the traffic flowed. The sun was bright.
The countdown had begun. Ten minutes left.
I picked up the coffee, felt the warm liquid slide down my throat. Deep inside, a cold, clinical, and fiercely satisfying anticipation was growing.
03
1:50 PM, on the dot.
My phone, face down on the table, vibrated, its alarm a soft, single tone. I calmly reached out, silenced it, and slowly took a sip of the now-lukewarm coffee. It was still rich.
In that very instant, Liv’s cartoon avatar began frantic, full-screen jumping. A barrage of exclamation points hit my screen like machine-gun fire.
“IT’S CRASHED! SLOAN! IT’S ALL CRASHED!!!!”
“Everyone’s test screens just went white! Everything is gone!”
“Database access is DENIED! The admin portal is down! Nobody can log in!”
“Cassie’s face just went sheet-white! Seriously, whiter than the wall! She was just bragging to Garrett that everything was fine, totally locked down!”
I watched the text scroll by, observing a distant catastrophe. I could vividly picture the pandemonium in the office where I’d spent the last three years. The frantic click of mice, the hysterical tap of keyboards, peppered with programmers’ shocked shouts of "What the actual hell?"
Moments later, Liv sent a shaky, 10-second video clip. The camera was jumping; it was clearly a stealth recording.
In the background, Garrett’s voice was sharp and hysterical, his professional composure utterly shattered by rage and terror. “What is this! What in God’s name is happening! Where is the data! I had gigabytes of data! It was fine a minute ago!”
The camera quickly panned across the tech floor: chaos. Some were slamming their keyboards, others futilely hitting the refresh button on blank screens, still others just staring into space.
The last two seconds framed Cassie. She was slumped at her desk, eyes hollow, her lips bloodless. A broken puppet, muttering over and over: “No way… that’s impossible… I checked everything…”
Liv immediately followed up with a voice memo, her voice low but trembling with excitement. “Sloan, the entire department is losing it! Nobody knows what the glitch is! They’ve checked all the logs, and there’s no trace of an abnormal operation! Garrett is reading your handoff document for the tenth time, and it says nothing about this!”
My lips curved into a cold, satisfied smile. Of course it didn't. Why would I write the instructions for your final, glorious exit in the owner’s manual?
“The investors are arriving in ten minutes! They’ve called the front desk! Garrett is purple with rage, I swear! He looks like a bruised plum!” Liv’s commentary was pure cinema.
I picked up my small spoon and gently stirred the last bit of coffee in my cup, watching the miniature whirlpool. My mind was profoundly, utterly calm.
I slowly typed my reply to Liv.
“Does this affect you?”
“You’re new. They can’t blame you.”
“Keep your head down, Liv. Protect yourself.”
I sent the message, flipped the phone over, and settled back in the chair. The sunlight outside seemed even brighter.
I closed my eyes and drew a long, slow breath. Coffee aroma, warm sunlight. The profound satisfaction of justified payback washed over me in warm, steady waves.
Garrett. Cassie. You engineered a plan to steal my livelihood and smear my name. Now, at the peak of your arrogance, I have shattered the thing you coveted most.
And this, I knew, was only the opening act.

04
The world fell silent. My phone, face down on the table, had stopped vibrating. The block list was working flawlessly, intercepting all attempts at panicked communication. I could imagine Garrett and the company HR, boiling in terror, frantically dialing a number that would never connect.
After about half an hour, just as I was considering a refill, Liv’s message came in. No more excited exclamation points, just a carefully typed plea.
“Sloan, Garrett has the entire team trying to call you, but he doesn’t know you blocked everyone.”
“He’s screaming and trashing his office right now. I just walked past, I heard glass shatter. He’s calling Cassie a worthless liability who ruined everything.”
“The investors are downstairs, being stalled by the front desk with a terrible excuse about ‘conference room network issues.’ They’re already suspicious.”
