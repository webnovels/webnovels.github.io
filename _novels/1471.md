Mom organized an engagement party for my boyfriend and Daisy—the silly girl from the corner store that everyone calls idiot.

Our neighbor asked her:

“Patricia, isn’t that Scarlett’s boyfriend? How on earth did Scarlett agree to this?”

Mom just brushed it off. “Scarlett’s more than capable, she can find any guy she wants later. Daisy rarely gets marriage offers. As chair of the local community outreach program, I naturally need to look out for the vulnerable first.”

Standing outside the banquet hall, everything suddenly clicked.

That’s why Mom kept trying to fix me up with men, either middle-aged security guards or guys with severe disabilities—even though she knew I had a boyfriend.

And I also realized what kind of "surprise" my boyfriend meant when he said he had a secret to tell me.

My mom spotted me and called me over to the stage:

“Scarlett, to keep things from getting awkward, just think of Ryan as your brother today.”

“Come, say hello to your sis-in-law, Daisy.”

In that moment, something inside me snapped.

My voice didn’t even sound like my own.

“Mom, Ryan—from now on, I want nothing to do with either of you.”
