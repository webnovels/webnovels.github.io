Today was supposed to be a regular Wednesday, until I saw that gaping hole in the financial report.

Five million dollars, gone.

"Mark!" I yelled for my assistant.

Mark rushed in, his hands shaking. "Mr. Blake..."

"Where did the five million from the Orion Fund go?" I slammed the report onto the desk.

"It was... it was approved by Ms. Vanessa," Mark stammered.

"She approved what? That's my private fund!" My voice shot up an octave.

"Ms. Vanessa said... she said it was a temporary transfer..."

"Temporary transfer?" I stood up immediately.

"What right does she have to touch my money?"

Mark flinched, taking a step back. "Mr. Blake, I was just following Ms. Vanessa's instructions..."

"Get out!"

Vanessa, my fiancée, was also the CEO of Skyline Investments.

We'd been engaged for three years, with plans to marry next month.

Now, it looked like that wedding was on hold.

I stormed straight into her office.

Vanessa was putting on makeup. When she saw me kick open the door, the lipstick in her hand clattered to the floor.

"Where's my money?" I walked to her desk, leaning my hands on the surface.

"What money?" Her eyes darted around.

"Don't play dumb! The five million from the Orion Fund!" My voice was so loud the entire office could probably hear me.

Vanessa stood up, straightening her clothes. "Lower your voice. What will people think?"

"I *want* everyone to hear!" I pointed at her.

"Why did you touch my money?"

"Oh, *that*," Vanessa said dismissively.

"Jason's project needed some working capital, so I made a temporary transfer. It'll be back next week."

"Temporary transfer?" I scoffed.

"Five million is just a 'temporary transfer' to you?"

"Aren't we family?" Vanessa started to sound annoyed.

"Why are you being so particular? Don't you trust me?"

"Family?" My voice grew louder.

"Does 'family' touch each other's money without permission?"

Just then, Jason knocked and walked in.

He was the company's project manager, undeniably handsome – the kind of guy who could make any woman melt.

"What's going on? I could hear you arguing all the way outside." Jason feigned concern.

"Perfect timing, Jason." Vanessa's expression immediately shifted.

"Explain to Blake why your project needed that money."

Jason instantly looked remorseful, even his eyes were misty.

"Mr. Blake, it's all my fault. My incompetence caused issues with the project."

"If I hadn't desperately needed the money, I wouldn't have bothered Ms. Vanessa..."

"You bothered *her*?" I glared at Jason.

"Did you know that was my private fund?"

"I... I didn't know." Jason lowered his head.

"I thought it was company working capital. I'm truly sorry!"

"If 'sorry' fixed everything, what would we need cops for?" My voice was ice-cold.

Vanessa suddenly slammed the table. "Blake Davis, that's enough! Jason has apologized, what more do you want?"

"What do I want?" I turned to her.

"I want my money, and I want it now!"

"We don't have it now!" Vanessa yelled back.

"The money's already invested in the project. It won't be back until next week!"

"Next week? What if the project fails?"

"It won't fail," Jason quickly said.

"I guarantee it won't fail."

"You guarantee?" I stared at him.

"What are you guaranteeing with?"

Jason opened his mouth but couldn't speak.

"It better be back next week," I pointed at Vanessa.

"Every single cent!"

I walked away, but then turned back at the door.

"And next time, before you touch my money, you'd better ask me first!"
