Just as I was about to shove a handful of antidotes into my mouth, the doctor’s grip tightened like a vise on my wrist.

“Miss Anya, if you keep taking these, you’ll die!”

Remembering the tragedy of my previous life, I gritted my teeth, yanked my hand free, and swallowed the pills. The liquid burned my throat, my stomach churned, threatening to spill its contents, but I managed to regain a sliver of clarity.

The next second, the door burst open. Several men in black suits stormed in. Before I could even struggle, they forcibly carried me away. The doctor desperately tried to stop them, but his voice faded into the distance.

A bucket of ice water splashed over me, jolting me awake. I opened my eyes to find myself thrown into a secret room. The air was thick with the sweet, cloying scent of aphrodisiacs. Women lay sprawled on the floor, faces flushed, clothes disheveled.

Their faces were crimson, contorted in helpless agony.

Before I could react, a bowl of aphrodisiac, ten times the normal concentration, was forcefully poured down my throat.

The next second, my body erupted. My lower abdomen burned, and a fiery desire surged through every limb, making me want to throw myself onto the nearest man.

I tried to scream, but when I opened my mouth, I spewed out a mouthful of blood. Blood mixed with saliva splattered onto the floor.

I heard the women around me screaming, wailing:

“Please let me go! I can’t take it anymore!”

“Didn’t Anya already sleep with Julian Hayes?! Why are you still doing this to us?!”

I bit down hard on my tongue, just barely keeping control, and pulled out the last antidote hidden in my pocket, swallowing it whole.

The violent clash of chemicals instantly made me vomit blood. Nosebleeds and tears streamed down my face simultaneously. My stomach felt like it was tearing apart, and I writhed on the floor in agony.

My cries startled the other women. Their swollen, bloodshot eyes stared at me in disbelief:

“Why is Anya here? Who’s in the CEO’s room, then?”

My nails dug deep into my thigh, and I forced myself to shout: “Call a doctor! People are going to die like this!”

Just then, Serena, in a red dress, walked over, leaning on Julian Hayes. Her face was flushed, a look of satisfied bliss on her features.

Julian’s gaze swept over the women writhing in pain, their clothes torn, and his face instantly darkened.

Serena covered her mouth, feigning horror: “Oh my god, what happened to them? Who gave them such a strong dose? That’s too cruel.”

Before I could speak, Julian kicked me hard.

“You shameless whore! To steal Serena’s place, you actually went after all these women! Do you think doing this will make you a Hayes family wife?”

A gush of blood surged up, and my teeth mixed with bloody foam fell onto the floor. The pain made my vision go black.

“Julian… it wasn’t me, it was her…”

Before I could finish, Julian kicked me again, heavily, right in my lower abdomen.

I curled up in pain, cold sweat instantly drenching my clothes.

He looked down at me, his voice like ice:

“You think you’re the boss just because you were raised as Julian's childhood fiancée? Do you really think I don’t know about all your little tricks against Serena?”

He straightened up, his eyes cold, and embraced Serena as he walked out the door.

“Since you made these women suffer so much, you can personally take care of them!”

The door clicked shut, locking us inside, like a death knell isolating us from the outside world.

The air was hot and suffocating. I lay sprawled on the floor, my limbs still trembling, but I heard rustling sounds nearby.

The women, their eyes vacant, faces flushed, moved like a pack of wild animals. Their bodies were covered in scratches and tearing wounds, yet they seemed to feel no pain, lunging at me like mad.

As I tried to move, my hair was yanked back hard.

“It’s all you! You turned us into this!”

Sharp nails dug into my shoulder. I didn’t even have the strength to struggle.

Someone tore at my clothes, someone else clawed at my back, leaving bleeding welts that stung fiercely.

I tried to scream, but before I could open my mouth, someone forced my head down and slammed it against the wall.

“Thud——”

My forehead hit hard. My vision went black for a moment, and blood streamed down my face, into my mouth.

With a sharp rip, someone picked up a broken piece of porcelain and slashed it hard across my leg. My skin tore open instantly, and agonizing pain shot through my bones. I was on the verge of passing out.

“Drink! Drink all the dregs! You put us through this, why should you be clear-headed?!”

They forcefully pinched my chin, shoving the bowl of leftover sludge—mixed with dust, medicine, and vomit—into my mouth, choking me until snot and tears streamed down my face. I nearly suffocated.

I was pressed onto the ground, convulsing all over, my consciousness slowly scattering.

When the women finally collapsed from exhaustion, I too lay motionless on the floor.

After a long time, the door finally opened.

A cold draft swept in. Julian Hayes’s leather shoes stepped through my blood, approaching step by step.

I lay on the floor, uttering low, hoarse whimpers of pain.

Julian looked down at me, his voice cold: “This is the first time, consider it punishment for you making Serena lose her position as Lady Hayes. If you dare to bully Serena again, I’ll make your life a living hell!”

My body trembled. I looked at him, my face covered in blood.

So, I wasn’t the only one who had been reborn.

I hadn’t even done anything, yet he claimed I had harmed Serena.

Julian said coldly: “Anya, you betrayed me first, you’ve already lost the right to stand by my side. Only a kind girl like Serena deserves to be Lady Hayes.”

I trembled, blood oozing from my lips every time I spoke.

“I didn’t betray you, and I didn’t harm her, nor did I want to disturb you two. I took so many antidotes precisely because I didn’t want you to be drawn to my aura. Why, why are you still doing this to me?”

His expression froze for a moment, but the next second, the light in his eyes turned into bone-deep disgust.

“Stop acting, Anya.”

“If you truly didn’t want to touch me, would you have given yourself and those women ten times the dose of the aphrodisiac? If not to seduce me, then what was it for?”

“You just want to climb up, to snatch the Lady Hayes position. I’ve seen this act too many times before!”

I grabbed his pant leg, begging for a moment’s reprieve.

But he scoffed coldly, pulled his foot away, and kicked me hard, sending me tumbling into the stained medicine and vomit.

My head hit the tiled floor with a heavy thud, and a streak of blood flowed from the corner of my eye.

“Want to prove you weren’t trying to compete with Serena? Fine, go find my mom right now and tell her you want to break off the engagement.”

“Then, be a good Hayes family servant. If you dare to harbor any improper thoughts again, I’ll immediately send you and your entire village to mine in Africa! Do you hear me?”
