It was New Year’s Day, and my parents were enjoying the holiday quietly. Our next-door neighbor, little Lily, came over to play. I went straight for the treat my mom, Julia, had bought—a beautiful, frosted raspberry mousse cake—and offered her a slice.

I never imagined that one bite would send her into anaphylactic shock. By the time we rushed her to the hospital, it was too late. She was gone.

Because I was under fourteen, the court ruled it an accident, and I wasn't formally charged. But my parents, David and Julia, were left with a crushing, massive settlement to pay.

My dad took on three jobs, hustling day and night to cover the debt. He was killed in a delivery truck crash late one cold night. My mom, unable to bear the shock and the grief, suffered a sudden heart attack and died almost immediately.

In a single, agonizing instant, I became an orphan, a cursed child, a jinx. Everyone pointed fingers. Neighbors spit on the sidewalk when I passed. Eventually, I starved to death, alone in our tiny, empty apartment.

Then, I opened my eyes. I was back. Back to New Year's Day.

The first thing I did was snatch the raspberry cake from the counter and destroy it, shoving the wreckage deep into the kitchen trash bin. I needed it gone.

But Lily still died in my house.

“Maya, that cake looks so yummy!”

Lily reached out, tiny fingers brushing the edge of the slice I was holding—the very slice I had just cut for her, a piece of the doomed dessert.

My heart hammered against my ribs, a trapped bird desperate to escape. I watched her hand move toward her mouth in sickening slow motion, fear paralyzing me for a split second. Then, I reacted.

I screamed, my hand lashing out, sending the plate—cake, fork, and all—flying across the kitchen and onto the floor.

Lily stared at the mess, her innocent, round face crumpling in confusion and hurt. She looked like she was seconds away from a full-blown cry.

“It—It’s bad!” I stammered, my voice strained and panicked. “That cake is spoiled. I have to throw it away right now.”

I practically shoved her out of the kitchen, frantically sweeping up the ruined mousse and crumbs, stuffing everything into a trash bag. That cake. In my previous life, it had been the catalyst for absolute ruin. Lily’s allergy, the wrongful death, the crippling financial despair that killed my parents—all of it flowed from that one dessert.

After the legal proceedings, when I was deemed only partially responsible for the accident, her parents—shattered by the loss of their only child—had focused all their venom and grief on us. They swore they would kill me to avenge Lily. My parents had been forced to sell our home, our stable, comfortable life, to pay them off and, essentially, to buy my safety. We moved to a cramped, single-room rental unit.

I remembered the smell of exhaust and cheap cleaning supplies in that tiny space. I remembered my father’s haunted eyes as he left for his third shift, trying to provide the life I thought I deserved. And I remembered the silence after they were both gone, the pervasive sense that the entire world saw me as a murderer, a plague. I was isolated, tormented at school by classmates who called me a killer. I had simply given up, wasting away next to my parents’ ashes, dying of my own accord.

But now, I was back. I had to stop it.

I tightly sealed the trash bag and hurried downstairs, dumping it into the massive, industrial bin behind our condo building, slamming the lid down with a furious, final heave. The immense stone that had been crushing my chest for five years—the guilt and the fear—finally seemed to shift.

It’s over, I thought, letting out a shaky breath. The cycle is broken. My family is safe this time.

I ran back upstairs, practically flying into the apartment. But as I walked into the living room, my relief evaporated, replaced by a cold, stomach-lurching terror.

Lily was on the floor.

Her face was puffy and scarlet. Her small body was racked with violent, unnatural spasms, and she was clearly struggling for air, wheezing and choking. It was the exact, horrifying tableau I had witnessed five years ago, the exact symptoms of a severe allergic reaction after eating the raspberry cake.

But… how? I had destroyed all the evidence. I hadn’t given her anything.

Frozen in sheer disbelief for a heartbeat, I then snapped to consciousness, a shrill, desperate scream tearing from my throat.

The next moments mirrored the past with nightmarish accuracy. Lily’s mom, Veronica, burst through the door. A hysterical call to 911. The sirens. The sterile, fluorescent lights of the hospital. The doctor’s grave, weary face as he delivered the same, crushing news: Lily was gone, a severe allergic reaction, too late.

Veronica lunged at me, grabbing my neck with a frantic, desperate strength.

“You! It’s you again! You killed my daughter! I want you to pay for this, you hear me? Pay!”

Her hands tightened. I couldn’t breathe. For a frightening moment, I couldn’t tell if I had truly been reborn or if the guilt and terror had simply driven me insane, forcing me to relive the nightmare.

Then my mother, Julia, and my father, David, rushed in, pulling Veronica away. They wrapped me in their protective embrace, offering endless, useless apologies. Seeing my parents—alive, whole, and still unburdened by the sorrow lines that would soon etch their faces—brought me back to reality. My voice, though weak, was firm.

“Lily wasn’t killed by me.”

Veronica shrieked, pointing a furious finger at me over my mother’s shoulder.

“You vicious brat! You think you can just lie your way out of this? She was fine this morning! She came to your house, and ten minutes later, she’s in an ambulance! Don’t tell me you didn’t do it!”

Her face was twisted with pain and rage. “You’re a monster! You took my daughter’s life, and now you’re going to give yours up in return!”

She was completely unhinged, looking ready to tear me limb from limb. My dad stood like a wall, shielding me completely.

I quickly turned to my mother. “Mom, please, call the police. Now.” I knew Lily’s father, Mark, would be even less rational than Veronica when he arrived.

In the past, my parents, believing I was responsible for an accidental death, had only offered silent apologies, enduring the onslaught of verbal abuse and physical threats. I couldn’t let that happen again. I wouldn’t let them be hurt this time.

The police arrived swiftly. A couple of officers managed to contain the volatile scene. I took a deep breath, trying to steady the frantic tremor in my hands.

“Officers,” I began, my voice clear despite the inner turmoil. “My mom bought a raspberry cake yesterday. This morning, I thought it tasted a little stale, so I took it downstairs and threw it away. I didn't give Lily anything to eat. I swear. I did not kill Lily.”

Veronica’s volume increased, her voice cracking with fury. “She’s lying! She’s a liar! Lily died in her house! You’re all just covering for her! You evil, conniving little beast! You killed my child, and you need to pay!”

My mother stepped forward, her face firming with protective resolve, finally finding her voice. “Veronica, what happened to Lily is a tragedy for all of us. But my daughter is not a liar. We believe the police will conduct a fair and thorough investigation to uncover the truth. You need to control yourself.”

Veronica immediately turned her rage on my mother. “A fair investigation? You raise a murderer, what does that make you? You people won’t get away with this! You owe my daughter a life!”

The situation was spiraling again. The officers quickly intervened, physically separating the two families.

The investigation began immediately. One team went to our condo building to pull security footage to verify my story. The other contacted the medical examiner to perform an autopsy on Lily to determine the precise cause of the fatal allergic reaction.

Because it was a death involving a minor, the police moved with terrifying speed. Within half a day, the evidence was collected.

We sat across from Lily’s parents in the police precinct’s interview room, a tense, suffocating silence filling the air.

Detective Miles, the lead officer, activated the screen behind him. It showed the hallway surveillance footage from our building. Lily arriving at 9:10 AM. Me rushing down the stairs with a heavy trash bag at 9:13 AM, my face grim. Me returning at 9:16 AM, looking visibly relieved, only to immediately rush inside, followed by my scream. No one else entered or left our apartment during that time.

They also showed a picture of the trash bin, where the destroyed cake was recovered. It was too mangled to determine if a full portion was missing.

Veronica, her eyes swollen and red-rimmed from crying, pointed a trembling finger at the screen.

“Look! She leaves looking distressed, but when she comes back, she’s relieved! She was covering her tracks! Raspberries aren’t common! I strongly suspect this wasn’t an accident. She deliberately murdered my daughter!”

“I did not!” I immediately refuted.

“Then why the dramatic change in your face?” Veronica demanded, her voice cutting through the room. “Why the panic before you went down, and the relief after?”

I knew my expression was damning. But how could I possibly explain? I was panicking because I thought I had broken the cycle, and I was relieved because I thought I’d saved my parents. Telling them I was reborn would only get me a psychiatric evaluation.

My eyes darted toward the medical examiner’s report in Detective Miles’s hand. That was the key. If the report showed no raspberry residue, I was in the clear. Lily’s reaction would be proven to have nothing to do with me or my cake.

Detective Miles solemnly opened the file.

“The victim’s stomach contents showed trace amounts of raspberry residue,” he read aloud. “This was the primary source that triggered the severe allergic reaction and death…”

The roaring in my ears drowned out everything else.

Trace amounts of raspberry residue.

I searched my memory again, scrutinizing every millisecond of the morning. I was one hundred percent certain Lily had not touched that cake. I had stopped her. I had thrown it away.

So, where had the residue come from?

The autopsy report had just sealed my fate. It was the definitive proof, the smoking gun.

Lily’s parents immediately erupted, screaming, sobbing, demanding justice and retribution. My parents, accepting the inevitable, tried to apologize, pleading for their forgiveness.

Dazed, numb, I allowed my parents to lead me home. It wasn’t until my mom, Julia, quietly mentioned selling the condo to cover the new settlement that I fully snapped back.

“No! Mom, Dad, you can’t sell the house! Absolutely not!”

If we sold the house, the dominoes would fall exactly as before: the tiny apartment, the crushing debt, Dad’s overwork, the accident, Mom’s heart attack. What was the point of being reborn if I just led them to the same tragic end?

Mom knelt beside me, stroking my hair. “Sweetheart, when you make a mistake, you have to own it. It was an accident, a terrible one, but Lily died because of something that happened in our home. We have to make it right.”

Dad added, “Losing a child is unimaginable. If we don’t compensate them fully, we can’t guarantee your safety. Money can be replaced, Maya. We just need you safe.”

I knew they loved me. That love was the very thing I needed to protect.

I was adamant. “No! I refuse! You have to believe me. I did not give Lily that cake. I did not kill her.”

They exchanged a look of pity and concern, convinced I was trying to avoid responsibility.

“Maya, we raised you better than this. It’s okay to admit a mistake. We will face this together,” Dad admonished, his voice strained with worry.

“But I’m telling you the truth! Lily’s death has nothing to do with me! She didn’t eat—”

My voice hitched as my eyes fell on a decorative doll figurine perched on the living room table. It was a novelty toy, a silly thing I'd bought years ago, intending to use its hidden eye-camera to film my hamster. I’d forgotten all about it.

The camera.

My mind raced. I knew exactly how Lily died.

It wasn't an accident. It was murder.

My parents and I drove back to the precinct, the tiny doll clutched in my hand. When we walked out hours later, I was no longer a suspect.

The police immediately launched a full-scale investigation, interviewing Lily's parents, her teachers, neighbors, and even the cake shop owner. Everyone became a potential suspect.

Lily’s parents, outraged by the police's shift in focus, staged a massive protest right outside the station, accusing us of collusion and bribery.

They went straight to the media, appearing on local news channels and posting emotional videos that instantly went viral. They knelt before the cameras, weeping openly and pleading for justice.

“Please, help us! Our daughter, Lily, was murdered in our neighbor’s home! Their daughter, Maya, fed her raspberries, knowing she had a deadly allergy!”

“The evidence is clear, but they’ve corrupted the police and somehow walked free! Now, absurdly, the police are questioning us, the victims! We adored our daughter! Who are the real monsters here? Is there any justice left in the world?”

The online response was immediate and overwhelming. We were swamped by a tide of abuse.

“Hell is empty and all the devils are here!”

“The parents must be trash to raise a killer like that! Lightning should strike them down!”

“The juvenile protection laws protect the guilty! They need to make an example of this demon!”

The virtual outcry escalated into a real-world threat. My parents’ workplaces were targeted with malicious reports, forcing them to take immediate leave. Our phones were saturated with hate mail and death threats. Our front door was defaced with violent red spray paint. Every morning, we found grim offerings—funeral wreaths, fake condolence cards, and pictures of my parents and me with black ribbons pasted over them—left on our doorstep.

Afraid of being physically attacked by an irrational mob, we huddled together inside the condo.

But despite the chaos, I felt a peculiar sense of calm. I knew this living nightmare would soon end.

We were in constant communication with Detective Miles, following the investigation. Three days later, the phone rang. Detective Miles’s voice was tight with emotion.

“Maya. We found the killer.”
