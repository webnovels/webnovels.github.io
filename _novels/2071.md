Ryan Miller broke his leg in a car accident while picking up my new car.
By the time I rushed to the hospital, Chloe, the owner of the car dealership, was already yelling at me.
"How could you make Ryan pick up your car? If you weren't so lazy, he wouldn't be hurt!"
Her voice was sharp, laced with an arrogant dismissal, as if she were scolding a subordinate.
Not just me, but all our friends and family who came to visit Ryan were stunned.
Ryan looked at her with a fond indulgence, then turned to soothe me.
"She's just very direct, don't take it to heart."
I scoffed, turning to the woman who owned the dealership.
"This is the second time your dealership has made such a basic mistake. If I don't get a satisfactory explanation within three days, just wait for it to go out of business!"

The girl's face went pale. She looked at the man on the hospital bed, silently pleading for help.
Ryan's expression shifted slightly.
"Evelyn, it was my operational error. It has nothing to do with her. I've already handled the accident."
I raised an eyebrow, looking directly at Ryan.
"What about my car now?"
Chloe winced at my coldness, her voice suddenly rising.
"Ryan's in the hospital, and all you care about is the car? Do you even have a heart?!"
"You must be Chloe, right?" I looked at her with a blank expression.
"First, that car is worth eighteen million dollars. It's a global limited edition."
"Second, Ryan is my legal husband. Is there a problem with him picking up my car?"
"Lastly…"
I paused, my gaze falling on her hand, tightly clutching Ryan's hospital gown.
"You're just a university student Ryan sponsored. By what right are you standing here questioning me?"
Chloe's face flushed red. She instinctively loosened her grip but still tried to argue.
"I, I'm just worried about Ryan! You could have picked up the car yourself, but you had to make him go. Now that something's happened, you haven't even shown an ounce of concern…"
I glanced at a message from my assistant on my phone and sneered.
"You should worry about yourself more. The car damage estimate is in. The initial repair cost is estimated at three million dollars. Credit card or cash?"
Chloe's legs buckled, and she swayed. She glared at me, stubborn and furious.
"Three million? This is extortion!"
Then she looked pitifully at Ryan.
"Ryan…"
Ryan propped himself up, wincing as he aggravated his wound, pressing his fingers to his temple.
"Evelyn, she just graduated. How could she have that much money? It was my mistake in the first place. I'll pay for it."
I looked at him, my voice dripping with sarcasm.
"Ryan, you always being the protector of delicate women, huh? Isn't gifting her a whole car dealership enough?"
Ryan clearly hadn't expected me to know about that. His expression froze.
Chloe lost her earlier bravado, biting her lip as she explained.
"Evelyn, take it out on me. Don't blame Ryan. He just took pity on me, that's all."
Ryan sighed, waving Chloe away.
"This has nothing to do with you. You should go home first."
Chloe lowered her head, walking towards the door, glancing back repeatedly with reluctant steps. Just as she reached the exit, she quickly turned back.
She pressed a beautifully decorated glass jar into Ryan's hand.
She looked up, her eyes wide and shimmering, holding a soft, pleading vulnerability that could melt anyone.
Anyone watching would have believed these two were more than just friends.
Chloe pursed her lips, leaving with lingering reluctance. As she passed me, she murmured.
"Evelyn, it was my work mistake. The car wasn't properly inspected before I let Ryan drive it away, and then the accident happened. Please don't misunderstand, that jar contains paper stars I folded myself, wishing for Ryan's leg to get better quickly."
The car wasn't properly inspected?
But the dealership had explicitly called me to pick up the car.
That last time the brakes failed, was that also because it wasn't properly inspected?
