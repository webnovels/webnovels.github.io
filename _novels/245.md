After the Black-Widowed Wife Faked Her Death, My Husband Sent Away 108 Mistresses

Even I, six months pregnant, and my five-year-old daughter were forced into the storage room.

"Pregnant women have a strong body odor. She's not allowed near Aaliyah."

"Lily's five years old; she should learn to do chores. From now on, she'll take care of Aaliyah's daily needs."

I cried, saying my daughter had to go to school, and hiring a nanny to do these things would be the same.

Chadwick said coldly:

"Aaliyah prefers quiet. A mute makes the perfect servant."

On the Dragon Boat Festival, Aaliyah tasted a zongzi that my daughter had secretly brought back from school.

Discovering it was filled with pork, which she disliked, she poured the boiling hot curry from the stove all over my daughter.

Sitting in my wheelchair, I helplessly beat my numb legs, my heart-wrenching cries echoing throughout the villa.

When Chadwick returned, she had already disposed of my daughter's body.

"That little girl was so stubborn; I only said a few words to her, and she ran away from home."

"With a mother like that spoiling her, what good could she become?"

I approached the rooftop.

Chadwick, I really don't have the strength to love you anymore.
