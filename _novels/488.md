The day I was acknowledged by the wealthy family, I had a three-year-old child by my side.

Sophia, the adopted daughter, covered her mouth and laughed, "Sister, life must have been tough for you these years, huh? You even had a bastard child. How dare you come back to the Sullivan family?"

My ex-fiancé, Mark Foster, immediately darkened his face and turned to Mr. Foster Sr., saying, "I absolutely refuse to marry a woman with such a questionable background."

I lowered my head, gently stroking my child's soft hair, and nodded obediently, "Alright."

After all, this child belonged to his uncle.
