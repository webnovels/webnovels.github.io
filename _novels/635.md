Chapter 1
Paige Gabert was the daughter of the Lancaster family's driver.

By all accounts, a woman like her should never have drawn the attention of the Lancasters. 

However, three years ago, the family's most beloved youngest son, Reagan Lancaster, was permanently blinded in a car accident. His temperament changed drastically to the point where he shut everyone out, except Paige.

For three years, Paige devoted herself to his care. Out of gratitude, the Lancaster family had little choice but to announce publicly that she was Reagan's fiancée.

Yet, on the day of their engagement, Reagan suddenly regained his vision, forcing the ceremony to a halt.

He raged behind closed doors.

"Now that I've regained my vision, why should I marry a driver's daughter? Has our Lancaster family gone bankrupt?" 

His mother, Quinn Norton, felt her heart soar, though her face feigned reluctance.

"Would you have recovered so quickly if not for Paige's devoted care? One mustn't forget gratitude. 

"But love can't be forced. Why not spend a little more time together? If it still doesn't work out, you can part ways later. There's no rush."

And so, what should have been a joyous engagement collapsed into a farce.

The Lancaster family told the public that Reagan's eyes had only just recovered and needed delicate care. However, anyone discerning knew the truth—they deemed Paige unworthy of him and tried to force her out quietly.

Yet, even though it was the Lancaster family's scheme, the scorn fell solely on Paige.

"Just a plain girl dreaming above her station. She served Mr. Lancaster for a few years and now dares to dream of climbing the social ladder. What a laughable fantasy."

"Exactly. If marrying into the rich were that easy, I'd want to be reborn as a wealthy family's nanny in my next life."

And at that very moment, as the tide of public opinion turned against her, Paige knelt obediently in Quinn's study, enduring her lecture.

"Feelings can't be forced. Reagan doesn't love you. You won't be happy even if I force him to marry you. In recognition of your devotion to him, though, I'll give you three months. If he changes his mind by then, the wedding will proceed.

"If not, I'll give you a million dollars to end your ties with Reagan. Do we have an agreement?"

Paige kept her gaze lowered, her long lashes veiling the shadows beneath her eyes.

She gave a quiet nod.

As she turned to leave, she heard Quinn's voice. "Reagan's eyesight has only just healed, so he can't drink. Go and bring him back."

Emmanuel Gabert, Paige's father, drove her to the entrance of a bar.

…

Rain poured down outside. When Paige reached for her umbrella, Emmanuel took it from her, explaining, "Mrs. Lancaster said Mr. Lancaster must see you in the rain. That way, he'll feel sorry for you."

The early autumn air carried no warmth. Paige's skin had goosebumps along her arms as the rain landed on her skin in the chilly wind.

"Dad, does it really have to be this way?"

Emmanuel's eyes turned red.

"The Lancaster family once saved your mom's life and gave us a roof over our heads. A debt like that can't be forgotten. I've already handed in my resignation to Mr. Carson. Once it's approved, I'll take you away from here."

Paige's lips curved into a bitter smile. Then, she turned and slipped into the noisy, crowded bar.

The bar's air conditioning was biting, and she shivered the moment she stepped inside. Her gaze quickly found Reagan lounging in the most prominent seat, surrounded by beautiful women, reckless and at ease.

When Paige tried to approach, the women acted as though she were invisible, forming a wall that kept her from getting anywhere near him.

With no other choice, she raised her voice. However, before the words had entirely left her lips, a wine glass came hurtling toward her.

The room fell silent in an instant.

"You scared the hell out of me by yelling like some ghost."

Reagan spared her a fleeting glance, cold and detached. He seemed so distant that it was impossible to reconcile him with the man who had clung to her so tenderly the night before.

Paige lowered her gaze, her voice barely above a whisper. "Your eyes have only just healed. You shouldn't drink so much. Let's go home."

For three beats, the room held its breath. Then, loud and cruel laughter exploded around her.

"Mr. Lancaster, is your nanny running here to keep you in line?" someone sneered.

"I've heard of henpecked husbands, but this is the first time I've seen a nanny doing the henpecking. I can't stop laughing."

"She's dedicated, I'll give her that. Why don't you hand her over, Mr. Lancaster? I wouldn't mind knowing what it feels like to be doted on," another scoffed.

Reagan lounged against the oversized couch, blowing out a stream of smoke, an unreadable smile playing on his face.

"Paige, if you humiliate me here, are you sure you can handle the consequences?"

Noticing her silence, he nudged an unopened bottle of red wine with his foot, sending it rolling until it came to rest at her feet.

"Show me your sincerity," he said. "Then, I'll leave with you."

Paige's hand moved instinctively to her lower abdomen. It was the first day of her period, the day her body always betrayed her with the worst pain.

Over the past three years, every time she had her period, Reagan would tenderly warm her stomach and say, "You take care of me all the time. Now it's my turn to take care of you."

She couldn't fathom why he had turned into a different man the moment his vision returned, but surely, he hadn't erased those memories.

She lifted her eyes, ready to speak, only to catch his gaze. 

Reagan's eyes lingered on her hand against her stomach, his lips curving into a mocking, almost cruel smile.

In that instant, Paige understood.

She bent down, picked up the bottle, and pulled the cork free. Then, she tilted her head back and drained the wine in one go.

She drank so cleanly that only the delicate rise and fall of her pale throat was visible. Reagan couldn't tear his eyes away. His tie felt unbearably tight, and his mouth went dry.

The next moment, Paige was hoisted upside down, slung across his shoulder as he strode toward the empty private room next door.
