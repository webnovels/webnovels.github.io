A female coworker who'd only been at the company for a month asked to borrow $400,000 from me.

I said no. She called me a loser to my face.

"A guy in his thirties who doesn't even have $400k? That's pathetic if I've ever heard it. If I were you, I wouldn't even want to show my face in public!"

She started spreading rumors around the office that I must be a gambling addict. Otherwise, why else would I be broke?

What she didn't realize was my family owns eight rental properties—including the very office building where she works.


The second I walked into the office, I could feel everyone staring. Their looks were weird and uncomfortable—people were whispering and pointing.

I'd barely sat down when Madison, the new office clerk, let out a bitter laugh.

"No wonder you're flat broke. You can't even get to work on time. What were you up to last night?"

"Probably blew all his cash gambling again. Total degenerate."

I froze and turned to Madison. "Who are you talking about?"

Madison rolled her eyes. "Take a guess."

She settled into her desk chair. "Some loser who can't even scrape together $400k. Just looking at you gives me secondhand embarrassment."

That's when it clicked.

A few days back, Madison had come up to me awkwardly, saying she needed to borrow money to "get by."

I was willing to help with a small amount, but then she hit me with the $400,000 request.

And we'd only known each other less than a month.

I asked her what the money was for.

Madison acted like it was the most normal thing in the world. "Don't worry about what I need it for. You're in your thirties—you must have at least $400k saved, right?"

"If you lend it to me, I'll make sure you're rewarded."

Her finger traced suggestively along my shoulder.

I felt a wave of disgust. "I don't have that kind of money. Ask someone else."

I brushed her hand off and walked away.

Madison looked shocked by my refusal. Her expression instantly turned ugly.

"You're pathetic! You don't even have $400k?"

"The boss pays you good money every month, and you haven't saved a cent? I bet you gambled it all away."

"I've seen plenty of addicts like you. You'll get what's coming to you."

Before I could respond, Madison stormed off in her tight skirt.

Days later, Madison was still bitter about me refusing to lend her money.

I frowned, about to say something, when the boss called me into his office.

Within two minutes, Madison walked in too.

She shot me a dirty look, then deliberately stomped on my foot with her high heel.

I winced in pain and instinctively lifted my foot.

Madison immediately wobbled and fell to the floor, hitting her forehead on the corner of the desk.

The boss jumped up, quickly calling for someone to bandage her up.

That's when Madison pointed at me in front of everyone in the office, sobbing loudly. "Ryan! Why did you trip me? Just because I told everyone the truth, you're getting back at me?"

I was stunned, still trying to process what had just happened.

Derek, Madison's loyal little follower, immediately stepped forward and pointed at me.

"Ryan, what's your problem? Are you even a man? Picking on a woman like that!"

I frowned. "I didn't trip her. Believe what you want."

Derek scoffed, glaring at me. "Bullshit! You expect us to believe Madison tripped and hit her head all by herself?"

"You're just a petty little man who did this on purpose."

That's when Madison suddenly burst into dramatic tears.

"I might as well tell everyone. A few days ago, Ryan came on to me, but I rejected him. I guess he's been holding a grudge ever since."
