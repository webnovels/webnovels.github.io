"Lily, have you really made up your mind? You're choosing... Charles Foster?" My father asked, his brow furrowed with concern.

I looked at my parents' young faces, their eyes filled with worry and care for me.

It felt like a lifetime ago.

In my previous life, I had stood right here, ignoring their objections and stubbornly choosing Charles.

Then, my parents died in a car crash on their way to the hospital when I was pregnant for the first time. The truck that hit them seemed to have lost control.

Unable to bear the shock, I miscarried.

Charles held me as I lay weak and vulnerable, tenderly vowing to take care of me for life. Then he smoothly took over the Davis family business.

Over the next ten years, I miscarried eight times.

Until I caught him with Rebecca Lee in our bedroom, gleefully savoring my pain.

Only then did I learn that my parents' car accident was arranged by him, and he was behind my eight miscarriages.

They even had a ten-year-old son together.

He had married me only for revenge.

Revenge for my one comment years ago, when I corrected Rebecca's table manners, embarrassing her in front of others.

I confronted them, but he and the woman I hated most pushed me into a raging fire.

The agony of being burned alive - I would never forget it.

"I won't choose him," I heard myself say, my voice unnaturally calm.

My parents were stunned, their faces full of disbelief.

After all, everyone in high society knew that I, Lily Davis, loved Charles Foster to the point of being pathetic. Some even said I was like a dog he kept.

I met their gaze and enunciated each word clearly: "The person I want to marry is Charles's uncle, Alexander Foster."

Alexander Foster was five years older than Charles but was the true power holder in the Foster family.

In my previous life, by the time I died, he had become a legendary figure in the financial news, leading the Foster family to unprecedented heights.

My parents' surprise quickly turned to joy.

"Good, good! Alexander is steady and capable, so much better than that illegitimate son Charles!"

"An older man is better, he'll know how to treat you well."

They happily went off to contact the Foster family about changing the marriage arrangement.

I walked out of the mansion alone, wanting some fresh air.

At the door, I ran into the last couple I wanted to see.

Charles, and Rebecca Lee by his side.

The moment he saw me, his eyes flashed with intense disgust. He walked straight towards me.

A loud slap landed on my face.

"Lily Davis, you've got some nerve, making me wait outside for so long!" Charles snarled.

I held my stinging cheek, the pain sharp and hot.

At this point in my previous life, Charles was just an illegitimate son relying on my family's influence. He wouldn't have dared to even raise his voice at me, only sweet-talking me in a low voice.

He definitely wouldn't have dared to hit me.

I raised my head and looked into his cold, hateful eyes.

In an instant, I realized - he had been reborn too.
