I couldn't be bothered to say another word to him.

The news about the change in marriage partner would soon reach him from the Foster family.

Unable to marry into the Davis family, his already precarious position as an ignored illegitimate son would likely become even more difficult.

Over the next few days, my phone was nearly blown up by calls from Charles.

From initial questioning to later fury, and finally to cursing.

I didn't answer a single call or reply to any message. Finally annoyed, I simply blocked him.

I never imagined he would dare to kidnap me.

That day, as I was leaving the mall after shopping, I took a shortcut and was ambushed by Charles at the entrance of an alley.

The two bodyguards with me, assigned by my family, stood motionless on Charles's side.

Charles sneered at them contemptuously, making grand promises.

"I'll be the master of the Davis family in the future. If you know what's good for you, don't get in my way. Otherwise, when I control the Davis family, you'll suffer the consequences."

They believed him so easily.

After all, in my previous life, my love for Charles was well-known. They probably thought I was just throwing a tantrum.

I was roughly shoved into a car by Charles's men and taken to a place I would never forget for the rest of my life.

That abandoned factory, where I had been pushed into the fire in my previous life.

The air seemed to still be filled with the smell of burning flesh, a nightmare etched deep into my soul.

My whole body went cold, trembling uncontrollably.

Charles dragged me out of the car, looking down at me with a pitying expression.

"Lily, stop pretending. I know you're just playing hard to get."

"Now, kowtow to me three times, then announce our engagement to the world, and I'll forgive your willfulness this time."

Looking at his smug face, I felt utterly disgusted.

"Who do you think you are?"

Enraged by my words, he slapped me hard across the face.

"Lily Davis, don't push your luck!"

He lost patience, his face showing the viciousness I was most familiar with from my previous life.

"I've already told your parents about your disappearance. They're on their way here now."

"I'll arrange another car accident, just like last time, to make them die the same way again."

My mind went blank with a roar.

The scene of my parents' tragic death from my previous life replayed in my mind. I could no longer stand, collapsing to the ground, shaking violently.

Tears streamed down my face uncontrollably.

Charles stood there, savoring my desperate and painful expression with satisfaction.

Just then, several blinding headlights suddenly illuminated the entire alley.

Alexander Foster got out of a car with his men.

With just one look from him, the men behind him quickly subdued Charles and his accomplices, forcefully pushing them into the cars.

I was still in shock, clutching Alexander's sleeve tightly.

"My parents? What happened to my parents?"

He took off his coat and draped it over my shoulders, looking at me with those deep eyes, his voice steady and reassuring.

"Don't be afraid. I arranged protection in advance. Your parents are safe."

My nerves, stretched to the limit, finally snapped at hearing these words.

My vision went black, and I knew no more.
