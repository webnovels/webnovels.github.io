I was an expert pretender, a high-level fraud. I wore knock-off designer clothes and my husband worked demolition, but online, I cultivated the image of a wealthy, stay-at-home society wife.

At the parent-teacher conference, I had my son, Leo, show off for the crowd.

“My dad is closing a big deal in Dubai right now!” he’d chirp.

“And my mom’s diamonds are brighter than the stars!”

I soaked in the envious stares of the other parents, the ones who genuinely had money. I looked down at my son.

“The most important thing in this world, honey,” I lectured him, my voice low, “is money.”

At the exact same time, my husband, Rhys, and I were crammed into our dingy, three-hundred-square-foot studio apartment, having a screaming match.

“Have you no shame?” he’d yelled, his voice strained. “You’d trade your dignity just for cash?”

A cold light flashed in my eyes. I stared intently at his face for a long moment, then broke into a slow, unsettling smile. “You honestly don’t know why I do this, do you?”

Back at the conference, Leo had been celebrated as the top student in his class, and the eyes of his classmates’ parents were warm with admiration.

“Leo, your mom is so pretty! She smells so nice, too.”

Leo beamed, lifting his chin and clutching my hand. “Of course. My mom is the best and the most beautiful!”

The other parents were excessively friendly. Mrs. Davies, Piper’s mother, fixated on the Vacheron Constantine bracelet I’d splurged on—a costly replica—and gave me a skeptical once-over.

I held my hand out, letting her get a good look. “Rhys picked it up for me during his last trip,” I said, smiling easily.

She nodded, then asked, “Maya, where do you live? The Heights?”

The Heights was the respectable, upper-middle-class neighborhood tied to the school.

I shook my head, my face an impassive mask. “I live at The Somerset Towers.”

Mrs. Davies audibly gasped. “I heard the rent there is insane. Your family must be loaded.”

I spoke in a casual, airy tone. “It’s fine. Just an eight-figure place, nothing too crazy.”

Another ripple of astonishment spread through the group.

After the usual pleasantries, I deliberately took the fifteen-minute detour through The Somerset Towers before making the long, quiet drive back to our thirty-square-meter rental.

I sighed, carefully tucking the fake bracelet away in a small, bolted safe. I held Leo’s hand and asked him, “If a friend wants to come over tomorrow, what do you tell them?”

My son nestled against me, blinking his big eyes. He gave the practiced response. “I’ll tell them I have one-on-one tutoring all evening and I can’t have guests.”

I nodded in satisfaction and caressed his cheek, just about to praise him for being so clever.

But Leo hesitated, then whispered, “Mom… if Dad finds out we’re lying, will he be angry? He said he hates lying kids the most.”

I opened my mouth, but before I could reply, the door creaked open.

Rhys walked in, still wearing his soot-stained work clothes, looking completely exhausted. His gaze was sharp, a laser beam fixed on me, and his voice was tight with suppressed fury.

“Maya, have you completely lost it?! Why are you forcing Leo to lie? Do you want to ruin him?”

I met his stare with a cold, even one of my own. “This is how I show him love.”

His eyes were red-rimmed, and he looked at me like I was incomprehensible.

“The card—you ran up sixty-eight thousand dollars today. What on earth did you buy?”

My expression didn’t change. “A bracelet.”

He started to tremble, choking on his anger. “That’s our rent for a year! And my medication! The electric bill, the tuition—none of that is free. Maya, for the sake of appearances, you’re throwing away everything we have! You’ve completely lost your sense of self!”

He raised his voice, a mistake.

I turned icy. “That was my savings. I’ll spend it however I want. What business is it of yours?”

He recoiled, clutching his chest, a look of pure disbelief on his face. “How could you change so much?”

I almost laughed. Tears even welled up in my eyes. Did he truly not know the reason?

Rhys had a heart condition and couldn't handle stress. Because of his sickness, I had supported him for six of the seven years we’d been married, working three jobs a day, killing myself to keep a roof over our heads. I smiled at customers behind a retail counter by day, bussed tables and dressed up as a goofy mascot by night.

Just as our lives had finally started to stabilize and his heart condition was under control, I decided I couldn’t do it anymore.

Late that night, I went through my usual routine and started my live stream. Ostensibly, I was sharing the daily life of a wealthy wife. In reality, I was waiting for the perfect moment to slip in subtle product placements.

I angled the shot strategically so viewers could see the faux antique-white hutch I’d bought for eight hundred dollars. The nightstands and the giant memory-foam mattress? I’d picked those up from the curb in an affluent neighborhood and paid a truck service to haul them back.

I smiled into the camera, clad in a silk pajama set, and waved at my followers.

“A private chef? Oh, no, we have four staff members—so I don’t have to work or cook, of course!”

“Leo goes to a regular public school nearby. It’s important for him to experience the real world, to develop his practical skills.”

A comment popped up.

【Sister, your hair looks so luxurious! Must be salon-quality!】

I spotted the comment immediately. I laughed and picked up my thirty-dollar bottle of smoothing serum. “This? It’s all done at my private salon, darling, but I do have a little link below for a great dupe!”

In that single hour-long stream, I covertly promoted eight different products.

Later that night, I turned off the stream and let out a long, exhausted breath.

The next morning, I heard Rhys talking to Leo in the living room.

“Son, maybe we should skip the class field trip and spring picnic this year.”

“Why, Dad? Everyone’s going! Gemma next door is going.”

Rhys’s face darkened instantly. He clearly wasn't pleased with Leo's response. He sighed, carefully gauging Leo’s reaction, and continued, “But the picnic costs several hundred dollars. That money could buy Dad’s medication for a whole week, or groceries for a month.”

He lowered his voice conspiratorially. “You know we don’t have a lot of money…”

Leo lowered his head, his little hands tightly clutching the edge of his shirt.

At that moment, a fire blazed up in my chest.

“He is absolutely going! Why wouldn’t he go?”

I converted the money I’d earned the day before into cash and pressed it into Leo’s hand.

“Not only are we going, but we’re going to have the best time. We’re going to the grocery store. Buy snacks and drinks, and make sure you share them with all your classmates. Be generous.”

Leo’s eyes lit up, but he glanced fearfully at his father.

Rhys shot up to his feet, his lips trembling with rage. “Maya, where did you get that money? Why are you being so extravagant?!”

“We should be modeling the right values for our financial situation! You’ll ruin Leo!”

My eyes were glacial. “If not for me, would you rather let him be the only kid in class who gets excluded because he couldn’t pay the fee?”

He frowned. “Kids are innocent and harmless. They wouldn't bully Leo. Stop being so paranoid.”

I rolled my eyes. “And so?”

I took Leo’s hand and led him toward the door, intending to take him to the mall to pick out a new brand-name jacket.

I told my son, “You deserve to feel included. You deserve all of this. You have the right to own it.”

I pointed to a luxury car being displayed in the mall showroom.

“See that, sweetie? Remember the brand and what it looks like. You can tell everyone that’s what our family drives.”

Leo nodded obediently.

“You are teaching him to lie!” Rhys roared.

“You are beyond saving.”

I offered Rhys a cold, half-smile, staring right into his eyes. “It’s just a white lie, Rhys. If it benefits us, what’s the harm?”

Leo’s popularity and overall standing in school improved significantly.

A few days later, Leo’s teacher called me out of the blue. “Leo’s mother, something has happened at school. You need to come down right away.”

My stomach dropped.

When I rushed over, I saw Leo kneeling in the back of the classroom, sobbing uncontrollably. His palms were raw and red as he painstakingly wrote a letter of apology and repentance.

My husband, Rhys, stood there, watching him with cold indifference.

The cause: The school was holding a charity auction and asked each child to bring one item.

At the store, Leo had been staring longingly at a twenty-nine-dollar toy car model.

“Dad, can I buy this to take?”

Rhys’s face instantly hardened. “Do you even know what our financial situation is?”

He turned, picked up a discarded, worn-out stuffed bear someone had left on the floor, and stuffed it into Leo’s backpack.

“We’re poor. We don’t need to try and play big shots in public. Don’t be like your mother, full of warped ideas, obsessed with materialism and money.”

The old bear was dirty and smelly. Leo didn’t like it. His eyes welled up, and he whispered, “But everyone else is bringing nice toys…”

“Are you comparing yourself to others again?” Rhys abruptly cut him off, his voice rising. “We can’t afford to compete with them. We may be poor, but we can’t be weak-willed. You need to learn frugality.”

He squatted down. “Be good. We need to be simple and honest.”

Leo lowered his head and said nothing more.

On the day of the charity auction, Leo secretly took the money he’d saved in his piggy bank for an entire year and used it to buy the car model.

Rhys found out.

He stood over him, interrogating him like a criminal. “Where did you get that money? Did you steal it?”

In an instant, Leo’s face turned scarlet.

All the other children looked at him with contempt.

“What did Leo’s dad just say?”

“I thought their family was super rich?”

“They can’t even afford a twenty-nine-dollar toy? LOL, he had to steal money?”

“Guess they were just trying to keep up with the Joneses…”

Rhys pointed a finger at Leo’s nose, his voice laced with disappointment and disgust. “At such a young age, you’ve already learned vanity and one-upmanship. What will you do for money when you’re older—commit crimes?”

“I hate lying more than anything! If you cheat now, you’ll hurt people later!”

“You’re just like your mother—a fraud, shallow, and full of lies.”

By the end, he even sounded regretful. “I knew it. I knew you were both this kind of person…”

Leo didn’t understand what his father was saying. Seeing the sheer disappointment in his dad’s eyes, he was frantic and incoherent. “Dad, please don’t be mad! I’m sorry, I was wrong…”

Terrified, Leo reached out and tugged on his shirt.

Rhys yanked away, his eyes cold. “You will go right now and return that toy. Then you will kneel here, write a public apology, and read it out loud!”

Leo’s entire face was flushed a deep red. He buried his head low. In that moment, Leo’s sense of self-worth was silently and completely shattered.

I pulled Leo into my arms, trying not to disrupt the other children. I led him to an empty space and fixed my gaze on Rhys.

He was still blaming me. “If you hadn’t fed him all that rubbish, how would Leo have turned out like this?!”

I stared back at him, utterly cold. Suddenly, I felt like the whole thing was beneath me.

“Rhys, over the years, I accepted your ridiculous demands. I nearly killed myself working to pay for your illness. I even allowed myself to be strung along by you like a clown.”

“But the one thing I absolutely will not accept is you harming my child for the sake of your so-called test.”

I let the words hang in the air, then delivered the final blow.

“Mr. Rhys, the pretense of poverty has gone far enough.”

He froze, rooted to the spot.
