I was thrown by an out-of-control car when I was seven months pregnant, lying in a pool of blood.
James rushed me to the hospital with red eyes, spending a fortune to bring in the best obstetrics team, desperately trying to save the baby.
When I woke up, the ward was empty. Ignoring the excruciating pain, I got out of bed and stumbled around looking for my child.
But outside the ICU, I overheard James talking to the doctor.
"Mr. Wilson, the baby still has vital signs. Why are we giving up on resuscitation?"
"A bastard child would only be a burden even if it lived."
"Sophie just gave birth to my son. I can't let anyone threaten his inheritance rights."
So beneath his gentle and caring facade, he was hiding a poisonous heart.
The marriage I treasured was nothing but an elaborately designed scam.
Since he ruined everything with his own hands, he can't blame me for leaving him with nothing.
I stood outside the ICU, my hands gripping the wall so tightly my nails almost dug into the surface.
James' voice came from inside, each word like a knife carving into my heart:
"Change the time of death to during the resuscitation process. Just say we did our best, but couldn't save it."
The doctor hesitated: "But the baby still has a heartbeat."
"I said, this child cannot live," James' voice was cold as ice. "Sophie's newborn son is the only heir to the Wilson family."
"This doesn't seem right..." The doctor's voice was shaking.
"One million dollars. This is the down payment. You'll get another million when it's done."
The sound of rustling bills was piercing to my ears.
My child, the baby I desperately protected, was only worth this much in his eyes?
Through the glass window, I saw the doctor's trembling hands pull the oxygen tube from the incubator.
The tiny body began to struggle, twisting painfully like a fish out of water.
I wanted to rush in and stop it, but my legs felt nailed to the ground, unable to take a single step.
The heartbeat line on the monitor began to fluctuate erratically, finally flattening into a straight line.
"Time of death, 10:47 AM," the doctor's voice seemed to come from far away.
My whole body went cold as James' past vows echoed in my mind:
"Honey, when the baby is born, I promise I'll be a good father."
"Our child will be the happiest baby in the world."
How laughable, how utterly laughable.
Every word of love he spoke was just laying the groundwork for today's betrayal.
I leaned against the wall, inching my way back to the ward.
Not long after I lay down, James pushed open the door.
His eyes were still red, his face etched with grief: "Honey, I'm so sorry. We did everything we could, but..."
I looked at his perfect emotional management and suddenly felt sick.
This man could kill his own flesh and blood for someone else's child.
He leaned down to hug me, but I dodged him.
"What's wrong, baby? I know you're devastated, but we're still young, we can try again..."
"No need," I cut off his false sympathy. "I'm tired. I want to sleep for a while."
James gently tucked me in: "Alright, get some rest. I'll be right outside with you."
As he turned away, a hint of a triumphant smile flashed in his eyes.
But he would never imagine that the woman he had just destroyed would make him pay a thousand times over.
The moment the hospital room door closed, I took out my phone and called my best friend Kate:
"Help me investigate Emily's relationship with James."
"And the birth date of their child."
After hanging up, I closed my eyes, tears silently falling.
Baby, I'm sorry.
Mommy couldn't protect you.
But Mommy will definitely make those who hurt you pay the price they deserve.
Outside the window, the moonlight was like water, shining on my pale face.
That night, my heart died.
Along with the naive, innocent self who had been full of joy and hope for the future.
From now on, I'm just a walking corpse.
Until James kneels on the ground, begging me for a quick death.
