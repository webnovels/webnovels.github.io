My mother, Brenda Smith, rushed up to me the moment I got home from work, her face etched with worry. "Asher, I heard whispers about a high-temperature apocalypse. You work at the Weather Bureau, right? Is it true?"

I pondered for a moment. "I can't say for certain, but it wouldn't hurt to prepare."

No sooner had I spoken than my father, Robert Smith, stiffened. He grabbed my arm, his voice strained. "What do we do? You're the expert, Asher! You have to come up with something!"

My mother looked at me, her expression grim. "Asher, how about we set up a Family Survival Fund? We'll put you in charge of managing everything. If the apocalypse really hits, at least we'll be ready."

I agreed without a second thought. "Sounds good."

Brenda continued, "You've been working for years, you've saved up a lot. You'll be covering the biggest chunk..."

Before she could finish, I pulled out my debit card. "Fine. This is all my salary. I'm putting it all in."

Their eyes practically gleamed.

But then I shifted gears. "Now, hand over everything valuable you own. That includes any jewelry or accessories you're wearing."

"What?!" Robert exploded, instinctively shielding his wrist.

"Asher, what are you talking about? These are precious heirlooms Dad's collected his whole life, how can you..."

"Dad," I cut him off, my voice cold, my eyes devoid of emotion. "In an apocalypse, they won't feed us, and they certainly won't protect us from this hellish heat."

Leo's face paled too, as he protectively stroked his designer watch. He forced a strained laugh. "Bro, aren't you overreacting? Keeping one or two things won't hurt, right? What if we need them later..."

"There are no 'what ifs'," I stated, my voice cutting through the air, leaving no room for argument.

I turned to my mother. "Mom, you decide. My plan allows for no secret stashes, no hidden personal funds."

"Every single hidden penny, every secret stash, could be the final nail in the coffin of our survival. After all, we're facing a global catastrophe."

"Listen to Asher!" she roared, her voice echoing, as she made her decision.

Robert and Leo's faces contorted with agony and resentment, but they meekly complied.

I scanned their offerings, a flicker of satisfaction in my eyes. "Excellent. Now, write down all your bank card PINs for me."

The next day, I received a bank card holding their entire savings: 2.8 million.

Robert clapped my shoulder, his voice earnest. "Asher, this is our family's last hope. You have to be careful with it."

I took the card, nodding solemnly. "Don't worry, Dad. I will."

Then, I opened my laptop and logged onto a professional real estate valuation site, inputting the details of the house we lived in.

Moments later, a figure popped up.

Market value: 4.5 million.

A faint smile touched my lips.

Their paltry savings wouldn't even scratch the surface. This house, too, needed to contribute to the "Family Survival Fund."
