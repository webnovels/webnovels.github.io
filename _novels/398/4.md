That day, Leo had a fever of 101.3°F and was particularly clingy.

I stayed home, giving him IV fluids and playing with him.

Seraphina, in her heels, was about to leave again when Leo called out in his tiny, milky voice.

"Mommy, don't go!"

She hesitated for a moment, then finally sat down.

Seeing Leo's contented smile, I felt confident that giving her that chance earlier had been the right decision.

But her jarring ringtone tore through the tender moment.

Kai's voice, laced with tears, rang out. "Ms. Miller, someone's following me! Everyone online is calling me a sugar baby, a bootlicker, and a home-wrecker!"

"Is Mr. Thorne trying to drive me to my death? Ms. Miller, please tell Mr. Thorne I won't go near you again. Please beg him to let me go!"

I didn't even lift an eyelid, continuing to play with Leo.

Kai being harassed was expected, but it wasn't as bad as he claimed.

Seraphina, however, reacted as if she'd been stepped on, slamming her phone onto the coffee table.

Leo, startled, burst into tears.

Instead of comforting our son, she pointed a finger at me, ranting like a wild banshee.

"Julian Thorne, that's enough! I'm sick of your smug, manipulative face!"

"Kai's already gone, why won't you leave him alone?"

"I married you, Julian Thorne, I didn't sell myself to you! What right do you have to control everything I do?!"

My patience snapped. I pointed outside. "If you want to argue, get out! Don't scare our son!"

She scoffed. "Julian Thorne, you want to hurt him? Well, I'm going to protect him!"

With that, she ignored Leo's cries and stormed out, slamming the door shut!

I watched her retreating back, my gaze darkening.

She's truly lost her mind!

After putting Leo to sleep, I opened my laptop.

The scandal of Kai's illicit affair and sudden promotion, which had been all over the internet that morning, had mysteriously vanished by afternoon.

For that useless piece of trash, Seraphina had actually used the company's PR team!

Utterly pathetic!

I tried to ignore it, but then I noticed Seraphina had issued an official company statement.

The statement lauded Kai's exceptional professional abilities, sternly rebuking malicious rumors and threatening legal action.

A message from Ms. Davies from HR simultaneously landed on my phone: Seraphina had officially appointed Kai as Operations Manager, granting him an independent office on the executive floor and副总经理 (Vice President) level privileges.

My assistant also sent me photos from Kai's SnapChat, snaps of him looking ridiculously smug about his newfound 'success.'

He was decked out in custom-tailored suits, proudly displaying that gleaming watch.

I looked at the messages on my phone and let out a cold laugh.

Seraphina Miller, if you insist on promoting this parasite, don't blame me for showing no mercy!

After dealing with everything concerning the Miller Group, I rushed home, only to find Leo gone!

I anxiously questioned Maria, the nanny, who stammered, "Ms. Miller came back… and took the young master with her…"

The rage in my heart could no longer be suppressed. After learning from my assistant that Seraphina was at the amusement park, I rushed there without delay.

But I saw Seraphina and Kai whispering intimately ahead, completely unaware of Leo stumbling and struggling to keep up behind them.

His little face, flushed with fever, was slick with sweat, and he pleaded in a teary voice.

"Mommy… slow down… it hurts… wait for me…"

Kai's lips curved into a malicious smirk, and he casually extended his foot.

*Thump!*

Leo fell heavily to the ground, stunned for a moment, then burst into uncontrollable wails.

Seraphina instinctively reached out to help, but Kai suddenly spoke, feigning hurt.

"Ms. Miller, is the little master perhaps annoyed with me? Did he intentionally fall to fake cry?"

Hearing this, Seraphina abruptly withdrew her hand and looked at Leo with a scolding expression.

"Uncle Kai was kind enough to play with you, and you're faking a fall? Why are you so naughty?"

I lunged forward like an arrow released from a bow, scooping up Leo, who was now sobbing uncontrollably.

Rage threatened to consume me.

Seraphina's expression flickered, and she rushed to explain, "Kai said I shouldn't have left Leo when he was sick, so he suggested I bring him to the amusement park to make it up to him…"

I looked at her coldly. "What can a two-year-old child do at an amusement park?"

"Watch you two pathetic excuses for a couple put on a show? Or get deliberately tripped by him?"

The air was dead silent.

Kai’s smug smile froze on his face. Seraphina’s pupils constricted abruptly, and then her face hardened with anger.

"Julian Thorne, you're so ungrateful! We were…"

I held my shaken son and cut her off. "Seraphina Miller, we're getting a divorce!"
