I immediately halted the Miller Group’s major overseas deal, scheduled for signing next week.

The next moment, my wife, Seraphina Miller, started bombarding my phone.

But my secretary, Sarah, blocked every call. "I'm sorry, Ms. Miller, Mr. Thorne is currently in a meeting."

Playing the silent game?

I could play too.

Not long after, Seraphina stormed into my office, heels clicking furiously, and slammed her palm onto my desk.

"Julian, have you lost your mind? That was a $300 million deal! You're going to destroy my company over a stupid dare?!"

Seraphina, who always carried herself with such elegance and composure, was now acting like a raging lunatic, all for another man.

I put down my report and looked at her enraged, contorted face.

"You have fifteen minutes, starting now."

Ten minutes later, Seraphina sent a photo.

The Maybach’s interior was back to pristine condition, undergoing a professional cleaning.

I immediately notified my overseas department, "Proceed with the signing as planned."

Then, I sent Seraphina a photo.

Her cherished designer gown was trampled on the floor, and her beloved custom-made shoes were soaking in a filthy mop bucket.

"Seraphina Miller, this was also a dare. Remember my bottom line. This is just a warning. Cross me again, and the consequences will be beyond what you can handle!"

Silence from Seraphina's end.

I knew she was furious, probably boiling with rage.

But I was even angrier.

Our family alliance had been orchestrated by her back then, and it was *her* who rejected the option of us leading separate lives after marriage.

For six years, we went from a formal, polite relationship to one where we truly supported each other.

Especially after our son was born, I poured all my energy into our family, ensuring both the Thorne and Miller families flourished and prospered.

I thought we would stand by each other until we were old and retired.

But she shattered our happy, stable life.

That brief pause on the $300 million deal? It was just a warning shot.
