That day, Seraphina didn’t come home for the first time.

The next morning, I walked straight into the Miller Group, taking the internal elevator directly to the executive floor.

It was completely empty outside.

Our assistants should have been on duty. I hadn't brought mine today, but where was *her* assistant?

Loud laughter drifted from her office, seeping through the blinds.

I caught a glimpse of her assistant, Kai, holding a hairdryer, solicitously drying her hair.

Seraphina lounged casually in her office chair, chatting and smiling with him.

Seraphina used to be very strict about personal space.

No one, except me, was allowed to linger in her office for long.

But her tenderness towards Kai now felt like a sharp blade piercing my heart.

Even more glaring was the cold glint of the high-end watch on Kai’s wrist.

That was clearly the watch she had carefully chosen and bought abroad as my birthday gift!

Kai was just an intern assistant; he couldn't afford a single screw on that watch even if he sold everything he owned!

I pushed the door open.

Kai dropped the hairdryer as if electrocuted, forcing out a sycophantic grin. "Mr. Thorne, what brings you to the Miller Group offices?"

I looked at him coldly. "I'm a director and general manager of the Miller Group. It's not for an intern to tell me where I can be!"

"Go fetch HR. I want to ask her if the company’s hiring standards have fallen this low."

Kai looked to Seraphina for help, and she gestured for him to step out and let things blow over.

Just as Kai was about to leave, I spoke, my voice chilling.

"Take off the watch!"

He froze, his hand covering the watch, looking pitifully at Seraphina.

I stared intensely into Seraphina's eyes.

"Explain this. Why is my birthday gift on *his* wrist?"

"The order receipt for that watch is still in my drawer!"

Seraphina's expression turned impatient. "He's my assistant. He reflects on me."

"Just because you insisted on cleaning the car he sat in, making him look bad, what's wrong with me giving him a watch to keep up appearances?"

"Your assistant’s wardrobe, wasn't that also bespoke that you shelled out for?"

I scoffed. "My assistant is a man who earns his pay through his own merit. That good-for-nothing, why does *he* deserve it?"

I pointed a finger at Kai. "Is it because he knows how to 'serve' you?!"

Seraphina’s face instantly turned ashen, and fury boiled in her eyes.

"It's just a watch! Consider it compensation for his 'suffering'!"

"I'll get you a better one for your birthday, alright?!"
