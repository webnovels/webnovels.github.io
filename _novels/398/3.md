I sneered. "A limited-edition watch? Who is *he* to even be seen with something like that?"

"Seraphina Miller, people should act in accordance with their standing."

I took a step closer, my voice icy.

"Mrs. Thorne wears limited-edition jewelry, custom-made gowns, and global limited-edition heels. That's only natural."

"But for Ms. Miller to enter the exclusive world of haute luxury… money alone won't get you in."

Seraphina exploded in rage. "Julian Thorne, we have important work to discuss! Assistant Kai has put in tremendous effort for this deal, please leave immediately!"

She actually dared to yell at me for that useless piece of trash.

I chuckled coldly. "Then let me see Assistant Kai's *real* capabilities!"

In a fit of pique, Seraphina hurled her bag at Kai and stomped out.

Kai shot me a smug, sleazy grin, then scurried after her.

Before the sound of her heels completely faded, I made a call.

"As planned, have Mr. Thompson give them a proper welcome."

Then I ordered a coffee and sat by the floor-to-ceiling window.

I'd only taken a couple sips when Seraphina called.

Her voice was so shrill I had to pull the phone away from my ear.

"Julian Thorne, you despicable schemer!"

"Mr. Thompson publicly ripped up the contract, calling Kai a gold-digger who 'sucks up' to rich women!"

"He even mocked me, saying I slept my way to the top, always wanting more and more!"

"You orchestrated this! I must have been out of my mind to marry you!"

I calmly set my cup down. "People will say what they want. How can I control that?"

"If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear."

Before I could finish, Seraphina screamed hysterically.

"The deal's off, Kai ran off humiliated—are you satisfied?!"

My lips curved upward. "Satisfied? I'm just putting things back where they belong."

Seraphina, seething, hung up.

I called Ms. Davies from HR and had every trace of Kai purged from the company records.

At this point, I felt I had given Seraphina enough dignity and leeway.

As long as she behaved herself and returned to being Mrs. Thorne, we could continue.

But I never imagined she wouldn't cherish the chance I gave her.
