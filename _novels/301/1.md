The person on the other end was in disbelief.

"Ms. Selene, I'm Julian Sterling, the untouchable kingpin of this city's elite. Don't mess with me. You've secretly protected the Thornes for twenty years. How could you suddenly give up?"

My voice was calm. "I'm divorcing him soon."

There was a clear pause on the other end, then an excited voice.

"You're not kidding, are you?"

"Back then, how many influential families in the city's elite were desperate to marry you? But you turned them all down, choosing to marry down from your prestigious background into the Thorne family, which was practically a nobody. You even helped that good-for-nothing Alex become the region's wealthiest magnate. So why are you suddenly willing to divorce him now?"

I didn't explain. I just stated seriously, "Don't ask why. From now on, I won't interfere with the Thorne family's affairs."

The other end chuckled with satisfaction. "That's what I've been waiting for. All these years, Alex has been strutting around like he's actually capable. If you hadn't been secretly protecting him, I would've dealt with him ages ago."

"Since you're getting a divorce, I'll make sure to send him a grand gift at the Thorne Group's celebration tomorrow."

Just as I hung up, Alex, who hadn't shown his face in three days, returned.

He walked straight to Leo's room. Seeing it empty, he looked at me on the sofa.

"Why isn't Leo home?"

"It's fine to relax after finals, but no need to stay out this late. My son, a Thorne, can't be too wild."

I glanced at the red marks on Alex's neck and said coldly,

"You still remember he's your son?"

Alex frowned, about to scold me.

The next second, as if realizing something, his tone softened. "Is Leo still mad about me leaving him halfway that day?"

"When he comes back, I'll coax him properly. He always listens to me; he won't blame me."

Yes, Leo always listened to him.

Knowing Alex cared about grades, Leo studied late into the night every day, always ranking first in his grade.

The day before his big college finals, he was still full of confidence, saying he'd definitely get into a top-tier university and make his dad proud.

But it was the dad he cherished most who, on the most important day of his life, caused his death.

I couldn't even imagine how heartbroken Leo must have been when Alex kicked him out of the car.

I choked back my tears, my voice trembling. "You won't be waiting for him anymore."

Alex's face darkened slightly. "You're a mother now, don't act like a child."

With that, he carelessly tossed a delicate gift box my way, dropping it on the table beside me like a handout.

"My little pregnant lady is clingy; she can't be without me."

"From now on, I'll only be home one day a week. Can you try to be understanding?"

He killed our son, showed no remorse, stayed out to care for his pregnant mistress, and expected *me* to be understanding?

Looking at his arrogant, condescending eyes, I couldn't fathom how I had loved a man like this for twenty years.

I pushed the pre-prepared divorce agreement onto the table.

"Sign it. Then you can focus on caring for your little pregnant lady."

Seeing me suddenly initiate the divorce, a sneer flashed across Alex's face.

"Looks like I've spoiled you with a good life all these years. You've forgotten your place. Without me, your whole family would starve."

Watching Alex's smug, self-important expression, I just found it laughable.

He actually thought the Thorne family's rise was thanks to him.

He thought I was dependent on him.

I couldn't be bothered to explain. I just stated soberly, "I am divorcing you."

Seeing my resolute attitude, Alex erupted. "What are you doing? You know Leo would never agree to us divorcing!"

"You want a divorce? Fine. Unless Leo comes and tells me himself."

With that, Alex stormed off, slamming the bedroom door.

Before, when Alex threw a tantrum, I would always comfort him and give in.

But not this time. I quickly signed the divorce agreement and left decisively.

The next day, I retrieved Leo's ashes from the funeral home, preparing to take them to the Sterling family estate in the city for burial.

Then, Alex's call came.

"You can throw a tantrum yourself, but don't take my son and disappear overnight. Today is the Thorne Group's 30th anniversary celebration. I'm announcing him as my heir. Bring him here, now."

I looked at Leo's urn and said, my voice heavy,

"Okay, I'll bring him right over."
