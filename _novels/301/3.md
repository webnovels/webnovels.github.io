Lost in thought, I arrived at the Thorne Corporate Tower with Leo's urn.

Inside the tower, the city's commercial elite, powerful families, and prominent figures were all gathered.

All to celebrate the Thorne Group's 30th anniversary.

Alex, impeccably dressed in a suit, stood among the crowd, dazzling and arrogant.

Brittany, in a delicate gown, clung possessively to his arm.

I walked in expressionlessly, and as I got closer, I heard Brittany pouting, her voice full of feigned victimhood.

"Oh, Alex, I'm so sorry. It's all my fault. I caused your wife to want a divorce."

Alex dotingly flicked her nose, his voice so soft it was as if he feared she might break.

"Silly girl, I'm so rich, and Selene loves me so much. How could she possibly divorce me? She's just making a scene; ignore it."

As he spoke, Alex's gaze landed on me.

His tender eyes instantly turned cold.

"Selene, didn't I tell you that today is the Thorne Group's 30th anniversary celebration and you had to bring Leo?"

"You came alone!"

Seeing me, the gathered elite and prominent figures sneered, their lips curling.

"Is that Mrs. Thorne? She looks like a country bumpkin, completely out of place."

"Just a housewife who stays home with the kids. Naturally, she can't compare to us business elites."

"No wonder Mr. Thorne prefers his secretary, Britt. With her shabby, unsophisticated appearance, she really doesn't suit Mr. Thorne."

The crowd's mockery made a triumphant smile bloom on Brittany's lips.

The next second, her eyes welled up slightly as she looked at me.

"Selene, I shouldn't have gotten pregnant and caused you and Alex to fight."

"If you really hate me, just scold me. Don't deliberately not bring young Mr. Thorne and wear something that looks like mourning clothes for this."

"You know today is the Thorne Group's celebration, and all the commercial elite are here. Doing this is just intentionally humiliating the Thorne family and embarrassing Alex, isn't it...?"

Brittany's feigned generosity and consideration made a flash of approval appear in Alex's eyes.

It also earned her admiring glances from the prominent figures present.

But I looked at her indifferently, stating coldly, "I don't care if you want to be a mistress to a pathetic excuse for a man."

"But don't mention my son. You're not worthy."

The banquet hall fell silent instantly.

The next second, Alex's face turned ashen. "Selene, watch your tone!"

"My tone?"

I scoffed. "The tone of Mrs. Thorne?"

"I don't care for it."

Alex glared at me, his face as dark as ink. "You don't care?"

"You don't care, but you still secretly use my money to support your father, making him, a mere commoner, drive a Rolls-Royce?"

"If you really had any self-respect, you wouldn't do such underhanded things to benefit your family!"

Because I was afraid my identity would put pressure on Alex and hurt his ego, I had once told my father to be discreet.

I never expected Alex to think my family was living a good life by stealing his money, all because of my father's slight oversight with money!

I smiled, looking at Alex, and said quietly, "Alex, you really underestimate me."


Eleanor Thorne, Alex's mother, eyed me disdainfully.

"I think *you're* overestimating yourself!"

"If you hadn't been lucky enough to marry into the Thorne family, do you think you'd have been a wealthy wife for so many years?"

"Since you've enjoyed the Thorne family's good fortune, you should just quietly be a good housewife. Don't be so ungrateful and make a fool of yourself!"

Hearing this, others present couldn't help but chime in.
