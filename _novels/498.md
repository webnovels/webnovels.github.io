My fiancée, Vanessa, embezzled five million dollars from my private fund.

Even worse, I discovered she and Jason, the company's project manager, had been secretly having an affair for ages, plotting to take over *everything* I owned!

Three years of my life, my love, reduced to nothing but a meticulously planned scam!

"Where's my money?" I kicked open her office door.

"Oh, *that*." Vanessa dismissed it with a wave of her hand. "Jason's project needed some quick funds. I just made a temporary transfer."

"Temporary transfer? Five million is just a 'temporary transfer' to you?"

"Aren't we practically family? Why are you being so difficult?" She actually sounded righteous.

"Family? Does 'family' cheat on each other behind their backs?" I slammed photos of her and Jason at a hotel onto the desk.

Vanessa's face went white, but she quickly composed herself. "What's there to explain? Jason and I have a purely professional relationship."

"Professional relationship that requires sharing a bed?"

Looking at the woman I once loved deeply, my rage boiled like molten lava.

Three years of tenderness and care, all just an act!

She treated me like an ATM, used my love as a bargaining chip!
