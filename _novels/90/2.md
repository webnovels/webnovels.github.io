In less than two seconds.

I received a reply.

Adrian: "Who are you?"

I changed clothes slowly.

Almost mischievously prolonging the response time.

Was he about to explode with anger, desperately wanting to tear the anonymous sender apart?

He, who had always been heaven's favorite, perfect from childhood to adulthood, was now having his emotions controlled by someone else, and by someone like me who he had always held in the palm of his hand.

Three years of depression and pain, finally getting a moment of satisfaction today.

I changed into my regular clothes, and during this interval, Adrian sent two more messages.

"Don't use such poor AI face-swapping. Tell me your purpose."

"I advise you to come clean yourself, and I might leave you in one piece."

I chuckled.

"Mr. Shaw, why don't you ask your wife if it's AI face-swapping? You'll know then."

"The kiss marks on my baby's neck won't fade that quickly (＾ｖ＾)."

I dared to say this because I knew Adrian was abroad negotiating an important deal.

He couldn't come back for at least half a month.

The next moment, my own phone suddenly rang.

I was startled.

The phone kept ringing furiously, it was Adrian calling.

I pursed my lips, staring at the phone until the call ended.

But soon, the screen lit up again, Adrian was persistently calling me.

I understood that this time, he was really angry.

My heart was pounding, feeling like I was walking a tightrope, playing an absolutely dangerous game.

I sent: "Mr. Shaw, stop calling. We did it five times, your wife is exhausted and asleep."

The phone finally stopped ringing.

My phone fell into dead silence.

I sent from the anonymous phone card: "I didn't mean to break you up, Mr. Shaw. Your wife and I are truly in love. Be magnanimous and divorce her soon, give her to me. Otherwise, if word gets out about you being cheated on, you'll lose face."

Adrian didn't reply anymore.

I nervously threw the torn lace nightgown into the trash, checked out of the hotel, and returned to the mansion.

The housekeepers were cleaning.

Everything was perfectly normal, as quiet as if nothing had happened.

Wash up, sleep.

At dawn, when the sky was turning white, I vaguely heard the roar of an engine and the sharp sound of tires braking outside the window.

When I realized and opened my eyes in panic, the bedroom door was knocked at the same time.

"Aria, open the door."

That voice was cold, the tone forcibly controlled to be steady, only faintly revealing a hint of anxiety and unease.

I was wide awake now, as if cold water had been poured over me, my whole body cold.

It was Adrian.
