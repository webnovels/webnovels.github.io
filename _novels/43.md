On our 5th wedding anniversary, my wife's first love suddenly appeared at the party and started cutting himself with a knife.

"Why? Why won't you divorce him and be with me? Do I have to die for that to happen?" Ryan pleaded with tears in his eyes, begging me to give my wife Chloe to him. He knelt down and started banging his head on the floor frantically.

Chloe was distraught. To comfort Ryan, she immediately booked tickets to take him abroad to clear his mind. She even took off her wedding ring and put it on Ryan's finger.

Afterwards, she explained to me matter-of-factly: "If it wasn't for your sister bullying him back then, how could he have tried to drown himself?"

"What I'm doing now is much better than what your sister did."

I watched the video of Ryan putting his arm around my wife's waist and smirking at me, but said nothing and just nodded.

Chloe thought I had become more understanding and obedient. She was very pleased and declared that she would make it up to me after Ryan's emotions stabilized.

But what she didn't know was that I had already bought a plane ticket to leave the country. She had also unknowingly signed our divorce papers.

Our home together was already gone.
