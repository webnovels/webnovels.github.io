In the end, I went to the hotel.

This relationship was completely over for me.

Afterward, I didn’t want to have any more entanglement with Kieran.

So I wanted to break up with him face-to-face and get the house key back.

After all, the place he was living in now was a house I bought with full payment!

When I arrived at the hotel, Kieran was angry when he saw me empty-handed.

"Quinn, what’s wrong with you? Where are the painkillers I asked you to buy?"

Phoebe sat at the edge of the bed, pouting pitifully:

"Brother Kieran, don’t be mad. After all, Sister Ning Ning has been busy with wedding preparations all day, maybe she’s just too tired."

She knew full well that the groom had been called away by her, yet she still spoke so nonchalantly.

Being ridiculed like this, even with my heart already in tatters, I couldn’t suppress the sting.

My fingers slowly clenched, nearly digging into my palm.

Disappointment reached a certain level where I no longer had the desire to be angry.

The couple’s hotel room was so cramped and ambiguous, I was almost suffocating.

My relationship with Kieran started back in college.

At first, it was his passionate pursuit that made me gradually fall for him.

When we were together, he remembered every holiday better than I did, always surprising me with gifts.

Even if I threw tantrums, he would take all the blame and patiently comfort me.

My best friends often marveled that I found such a great boyfriend.

I thought the same, which is why I wanted to marry right after graduation.

But everything changed when Kieran’s childhood sweetheart, Phoebe, returned from abroad.

Since then, Kieran’s heart completely leaned towards her.

Between me and Phoebe, I was always the one left behind.

Kieran affectionately ruffled Phoebe’s hair.

"Ah, you’re the understanding one."

Then he walked towards me, frowning in displeasure.

"Why didn’t you reply to my message?"

My repeated concessions only made Kieran push his limits further.

He abandoned the wedding and me, yet blamed me right away.

I tried to calm down, speaking coldly.

"I forgot."

Kieran was stunned, seemingly shocked by my tone.

I looked at Kieran coldly.

"Kieran, today you missed the wedding again."

Hearing this, guilt flashed in his eyes, and he angrily defended himself.

"I didn’t do it on purpose. Phoebe wasn’t feeling well. I can’t just ignore her, right?"

"We can reschedule the wedding, can’t we? Stop making a fuss, Quinn, be reasonable, okay?"

He was the one who did wrong, yet he turned the tables on me.

I had no desire to argue further, holding back my disgust, I coldly said one sentence.

"But I don’t want to wait for you anymore, let’s break up!"

With that, I turned and walked away decisively.

"Quinn, what the hell did you just say?!"

Kieran shouted, immediately chasing after me.

At this moment, behind me, Phoebe exclaimed, "Oh no!"

Followed by a crisp shattering sound that stood out.

I stopped, puzzled, and turned to look. The next second, my eyes widened.

The broken jade pendant on the ground was the one Grandma had prayed for my safety with every step!

I was completely stunned, an immense anger almost bursting out.

Realizing this, I pushed Kieran away and rushed to carefully pick up the jade pieces.

"Why is my jade pendant here!?"

I stared at Phoebe, loudly questioning.

Kieran came over, grumbling with dissatisfaction.

"Quinn, what’s wrong with you? You’re scaring Phoebe."

I couldn’t believe I met Kieran’s gaze.

He knew well how important this jade pendant was to me, yet he could casually say such a thing.

Suddenly, a sense of helplessness crawled all over my heart.

The soft flesh of my palm was pierced, bloody and mangled.

Indeed, when it came to Phoebe, I was always the one who had to give in.

But this time, it concerned Grandma, and I didn’t want to endure anymore.

I raised my hand and slapped Kieran hard.

"If you’re blind, go see a doctor!"

"She stole the jade pendant Grandma gave me without my consent and broke it. What right do you have to forgive her for me?"

The room fell silent.

I had never hit anyone before, no matter how angry I was.

Now, it was Kieran’s turn to be dumbfounded.

"You dare hit me? Quinn, I’m your boyfriend, and you dare lay a hand on me?!"

He rushed up, grabbing my throat, applying pressure until I could barely breathe.

He glared at me, eyes filled with malice and hatred, as if looking at an enemy.

I couldn’t help but think, when did the person who once looked at me with love change?

I remember when we hadn’t started dating, I posted a photo of a less than two-millimeter cut on my finger on SnapChat.

Kieran was waiting downstairs at 4 AM just to bring me a box of medicine.

The boy’s eyes were bright and full of concern.

"You dare hit me? Quinn, I'm your boyfriend, and you actually hit me?!"

He lunged forward and gripped my neck so tightly I could barely breathe.

He glared at me, eyes filled with malice and hatred, as if I were his enemy.

I couldn't help but wonder, when did the person who once looked at me with love change?

I remember when we weren't even together yet; I had just posted a photo in my Moments of a tiny cut less than two millimeters long.

Kieran waited outside the dormitory building at four in the morning just to bring me a box of medicine.

His eyes were bright and full of concern.

It was then that I was moved by his sincerity and agreed to his pursuit.

But only half a year later, he could hurl insults at me for another woman.

Only then did I understand...

True feelings can change in an instant.

After love is gone, no matter how much you argue, it's pointless.

The sharp pain in my neck reminded me of how ridiculous my efforts over the years have been.

I just curled my lips into a self-mocking smile.

Phoebe peeked out from behind Kieran.

Caught off guard, I met her mocking gaze.

It felt like a needle had pierced my heart, making it hurt even more.

The next second, her eyes turned red as if she were a frightened rabbit, and she said to me:

"Quinn, don't be mad. I just found the jade pendant and wanted to return it to you."

She playfully shook Kieran's arm.

"Kieran, stop blaming Quinn."

Only then did Kieran calm down and reluctantly let go of me.

"Phoebe, you're so sensible."

"Quinn, can't you learn a little?"

The pain of near suffocation made me tremble all over.

Phoebe pretended to help me up.

"Quinn, will you forgive me?"

Her tone was slightly ingratiating, but I clearly saw the provocation and mockery in her eyes.

It was like she was saying, "Yes, I took it, yes, I broke it, what can you do about it?"

I felt a chill of disgust and avoided her touch.

Phoebe took the opportunity to let out a sharp scream and fell backward.

"Ah—"

She clutched her wrist, looking at me in fear.

"Quinn, I just wanted to apologize..."

I hadn't even touched her, yet I became the villain bullying her.

Seeing Phoebe fall, Kieran quickly crouched to help her up and turned to scold me.

"Quinn, didn't you hear Phoebe say she found the jade pendant? Is it fun to take out your anger on an innocent person?"

I almost laughed at his words.

The jade pendant my Grandma gave me has always been precious.

Carefully kept in the drawer of my bedroom.

Found?

Did Phoebe accidentally enter my home, then accidentally walk into my bedroom, and finally accidentally find the jade pendant in my most private nightstand?

I couldn't be bothered to expose this poorly crafted lie and smirked.

"Fine, I will call the police and let them investigate how Phoebe found my jade pendant!"

"And I will hold you accountable for laying hands on me today!"

Phoebe panicked and immediately clutched her heart.

"Kieran, my heart hurts..."

Hearing this, Kieran dropped everything and carried Phoebe to the hospital.

"Phoebe, don't be afraid. I won't let anything happen to you!"

As he passed by me, he glared at me with gritted teeth.

"Quinn, just you wait! If anything happens to Phoebe, you’ll pay!"

He deliberately bumped into my shoulder.

The impact knocked me to the ground.

But Kieran didn't spare me a glance, snorted coldly, and left.

After they left, I remained sitting on the ground.

That familiar face, now twisted, unfamiliar, and terrifying.

My throat was dry.

Tears fell unconsciously, one by one.

As my emotions gradually calmed, my phone rang.

It was a call from the hospital.

I didn't hesitate for a moment and answered.

Grandma's condition had worsened, and she was already in surgery.

I didn't care about anything else and staggered to my feet, running outside.

As I stepped out of the hotel, I saw Declan.

The man, cool and dignified, leaned against the car door, his eyes lighting up when he saw me.

It seemed he was there just to wait for me.

Without time to wonder why he was there, I got in the car and asked him to take me to the hospital.

When we arrived, Grandma had already been saved by the doctors.

I breathed a sigh of relief and stayed by her side from the operating room to the ward.

With Declan by my side, I decided to tell Grandma about our marriage to make her happy.

Grandma flipped through the wedding photos on my phone, smiling genuinely.

"Good, good, good! Our Quinn finally found a good match!"

Declan sat beside us, answering all of Grandma's questions politely and without a hint of impatience.

It wasn't until the nurse reminded Grandma it was time to rest that I took Declan and left.

Before leaving, Grandma whispered in my ear.

"Quinn, Declan is a hundred times better than that what's-his-name you found before!"

"No doubt you're my granddaughter; you know how to pick them!"

My cheeks flushed instantly.

I mumbled a response and quickly left the ward as if escaping.

The next second, I bumped into Declan's chest.

Declan's amused voice sounded above my head.

"Did it hurt?"

Blushing, I didn't dare look up at him.

I just shook my head dumbly: "No..."

Even after Declan took the payment slip from my hand and went to pay, my heart kept racing.

I couldn't help but scold myself for being spineless.

We'd only met three times, and now he's my fake husband, how could I have improper thoughts about him?

I took a few deep breaths, finally calming down.

But I never expected to run into Kieran and Phoebe holding each other at the corner!

Seeing me, they quickly separated, a guilty look flashing across their faces.

But I just glanced at them coldly, with no emotion, and turned to leave.

Kieran rushed over and grabbed my hand.

"Quinn, it's not what it looks like, don't misunderstand!"

I looked up calmly.

"You don't need to explain. We have nothing to do with each other anymore."

Perhaps my unwavering gaze made Kieran uneasy, and he scratched his head in frustration.

"Ugh, is there any point in saying that? Phoebe's upset, I was just comforting her."

He leaned in and whispered in my ear, so only we could hear:

"I promise, we'll make up for the wedding next week, okay?"

"But Phoebe's in poor health, I don't want to upset her, so let's not tell her yet."

I couldn't help but laugh sarcastically.

If you have to hide and cover up even for a wedding, what's the point?

I smirked and shook my head: "No need."

I've already been married.

I left the last part unsaid.

Because the man in front of me wasn't worth any more of my energy.

But my indifference made Kieran anxious.

He blocked my path and demanded, "What do you mean no need?"

"Quinn, weren't you the one who always wanted a wedding? Why not anymore?"

The next second, a familiar scent of sandalwood enveloped me again.

Declan pulled me into his embrace, asserting his claim.

"Because we're already married!"

"She's mine now, and some filth should just disappear!"
