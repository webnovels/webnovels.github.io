Dad's gaze swept over the line of men before him, finally settling on me:

“Daisy, your old man isn't getting any younger. I don't know how much longer I'll be here to look after you. These are all young men I've watched grow up, carefully selected. Their character and capabilities are... *barely* up to your standards. No matter who you choose, your dad will bless your decision.”

Everyone held their breath, their tension palpable.

If I picked them, it meant a life of unimaginable wealth and influence, a smooth ride forever.

I looked at Trevor. The moment our eyes met, my fists clenched involuntarily.

The phantom pain of the inhuman torture from my past life still lingered.

Just a flicker of that memory in my mind was enough to send shivers down my spine.

I scoffed, my gaze shifting to Julian, who stood a little apart.

After I died in my last life, Trevor ordered my body to be thrown into a junkyard and completely destroyed.

It was Julian who spent a fortune, hiring people to sneak my body out, ensuring I received a proper burial and could finally rest in peace.

That kindness, I never forgot.

In a single breath, I'd made my decision.

I turned, meeting Dad's expectant gaze with a small smile:

“Dad, the person I want...”

Trevor was already poised, ready to step forward.

After all, everyone knew I'd been relentlessly chasing Trevor for years.

My husband, it could only be him.

“Is Julian.”

My finger landed squarely in front of *him*.

“I accept— *what*?!”

Trevor's head snapped up, disbelief etched on his face.

My dad, meanwhile, shot straight up from his chair:

“Are you out of your mind? Julian? He's a notorious playboy who's been caught with girls since his freshman year of high school! How could you possibly choose him?”

My expression didn't falter:

“Dad, you said you'd bless whoever I chose.”

I already knew the truth about that whole thing.

Trevor blurted it out when he was drunk in my last life.

Julian never did anything like that. Trevor just got worried that Julian, who was better than him in every single way, would earn Dad's favor instead.

It was all a lie. A nasty rumor.

A complete and utter scoundrel.

My dad stared at me for so long, I thought he was going to pass out from anger.

Finally, he grudgingly nodded:

“Fine, fine. It's just an engagement, not a marriage contract. If you want to have your fun, go for it. Your old man can always bail you out, no matter what.”

He agreed!

A wave of excitement washed over me.

I honestly thought I'd have to argue more.

Barely able to contain my excitement, I quickly reached out to give Dad's shoulders a grateful squeeze.

In this life, as long as I could get rid of that lecherous leech, it was a victory.
