I failed the bomb disposal mission, and my wife, also a bomb disposal expert, snatched the only blast shield from my hands and gave it to her first love.
I grabbed my wife's hand and begged pitifully.
She shook me off with a jerk.
"You're so selfish! You have a system that can revive you, what do you need the blast shield for?"
"Jack's body is already weak and can't withstand any impact. Two blast shields are the safest option!"
But she didn't know that the system had only given me two chances to revive.
One chance I used up, unable to resist her pleas to save her first love.
The other I used last year on a mission to save her when she was on the brink of death.
Today, I was truly going to die.
