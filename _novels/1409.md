Mom was a parenting influencer with a million followers. 
She preached about raising children with freedom and respect for their natural instincts, yet she demanded I score perfect grades.
For every point less than 100%, she'd slap me once. 
If I scored 90%, I'd be locked in the basement for ten hours without food.
To control me and my twin sister, Mom had "anti-laziness chips" implanted near our hearts.
If I zoned out for even one minute, my heart would throb with excruciating pain.
But when Bella binge-watched ten episodes of a TV series, Mom said she was just "balancing work and play."
Bella secretly erased my name from my perfect-score test and wrote hers instead.
Mom flew into a rage. 
She stormed to school and slapped me ninety-nine times in front of my entire class.
"You got a zero? How stupid can you be!"
Dad was silent for a few seconds before saying, "Elena, your mom is doing this for your own good. Don't blame her."
Everyone sided with Mom, accusing me of being ungrateful.
I tried to explain, but the next thing I felt was the piercing electric shock.
I looked at her with questioning eyes. What about Bella?
Why does she get to do whatever she wants?
My lips turned pale as I whispered, "Mom, I can't take this anymore."
Mom looked down at me from above. "You scored a zero. You have no right to be lazy. Study now! No food until you finish."
Outside my bedroom, the house was lively. 
I couldn't help thinking—maybe if I just rest for a moment, Mom won't notice.
