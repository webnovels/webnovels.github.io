News of my situation quickly spread to other classes in the department.

Not knowing the full story, some speculated I must have done something unforgivable, while others said I had some terrifying disease.

Every time I walked through the department building, I felt like people were pointing and whispering about me.

By this point, I had been staying at a hotel for over two weeks. The expensive hotel fees were draining my finances.

With no other choice, I could only ask my parents for more living expenses.

But watching a video of my parents crouched by a construction site eating plain steamed buns, I couldn't bring myself to ask for money.

After I was born, my parents decided not to have any more children, fearing I would face unfair treatment otherwise.

Though we weren't well-off, my parents always gave me the very best they could.

Even though their education level was limited and they couldn't help me with many things anymore, they still constantly encouraged and supported me.

"River, are you getting used to living in the dorms? How's it going with your roommates?" my mom asked on a video call.

"I know you're not very talkative, but try to get along well with your classmates."

"Making more friends will help you be happier."

"River, have you been eating properly? You look like you've lost weight after just a few weeks of school."

Hearing my mom's concerned words and thinking of everything I had been through recently, I nearly burst into tears.

I quickly ended the call. Even though I hadn't asked for money, my mom still transferred some over, telling me to buy some good food.

I knew I had to move into a dorm as soon as possible.

I had given up hope of rooming in my own department, so I begged the RA to help me find an empty bed in another department's dorm.

Finally, after the RA's tireless efforts, he managed to find me a spot.

"This is a room for seniors in another department," he explained.

"They're all out doing internships, so the room has been empty. There happens to be one spare bed available."

"We've talked to the RAs for both departments, and they've all agreed to let you move in."

Hearing this news, I wept with joy.

Someone was finally willing to accept me. I wouldn't have to stay in that expensive hotel anymore.

In high spirits, I packed up my belongings and gave the room a thorough cleaning inside and out.

I thought that if the senior roommates ever came back, I could at least leave them with a good impression.

But I didn't expect that day to come so soon. Before I could even enjoy two peaceful days of campus life, I learned that one of the senior roommates on an internship was coming back.

The night before the senior was due to return, I tossed and turned anxiously, unable to sleep. The next day, I was a nervous wreck.

I was terrified that as soon as the senior saw me, he would demand to have me kicked out again.

But fortunately, all my worries were unfounded.

The senior was very friendly, even sharing his snacks with me.

Seeing how clean I had kept the room, he couldn't stop praising me, saying he had lucked out with such an amazing junior roommate.

I was overjoyed, feeling for the first time the warmth of friendship from a classmate on this campus.

Things continued smoothly with my senior roommate. I felt like everything was finally back on track.

Until that day when I had just finished class and was heading back with some takeout and watermelon. I had plans to play video games with my senior roommate that evening.

But as soon as I reached our door, I found a crowd of people gathered outside.

There was my senior roommate, the RAs from both departments, and two guys I didn't recognize.

From their tone, I gathered they must be the other two seniors who also lived in this room - my other two roommates.

"No way. He has to move out," one of them was saying firmly.
