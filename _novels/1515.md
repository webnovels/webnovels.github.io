It was Valentine’s Night, and I was scrolling through my feed when a viral thread caught my eye.
“Couples: What is the single most romantic thing your partner has ever done for you?”
I left a comment: “He would wait in line all night, sometimes until dawn, just to get me the one perfect dessert I craved.”
But I didn't finish the thought.
Eight years ago, on a Valentine’s Night, that craving—that simple, selfish craving—was what he died trying to fulfill.
The familiar, suffocating pressure seized my chest again. My eyes stung. I reached to close the app, but a new, anonymous reply popped up.
“Funny coincidence. I think the most romantic thing my husband ever did was on a Valentine’s Night eight years ago, when his ex-wife wanted some ridiculous dessert and he secretly slipped away to be with me.”
“While he was in the shower, I texted his wife and told her he’d been killed in a car crash.”
“He knew and just went with it—faked his own death and has been laughing about it for eight years. LOL.”
“The day his ex-wife tried to end her life because of depression, he was in a jewelry store with me, picking out my engagement ring.”
A grainy, blurry photo of two backs was attached.
My entire world narrowed down to the screen. The man in the picture, his posture, the width of his shoulders… it was Pierce. My husband, Pierce Nolan, who had been gone for eight years.

It was Valentine’s Night, and I was scrolling through my feed when a viral thread caught my eye.
“Couples: What is the single most romantic thing your partner has ever done for you?”
I left a comment: “He would wait in line all night, sometimes until dawn, just to get me the one perfect dessert I craved.”
But I didn't finish the thought.
Eight years ago, on a Valentine’s Night, that craving—that simple, selfish craving—was what he died trying to fulfill.
The familiar, suffocating pressure seized my chest again. My eyes stung. I reached to close the app, but a new, anonymous reply popped up.
“Funny coincidence. I think the most romantic thing my husband ever did was on a Valentine’s Night eight years ago, when his ex-wife wanted some ridiculous dessert and he secretly slipped away to be with me.”
“While he was in the shower, I texted his wife and told her he’d been killed in a car crash.”
“He knew and just went with it—faked his own death and has been laughing about it for eight years. LOL.”
“The day his ex-wife tried to end her life because of depression, he was in a jewelry store with me, picking out my engagement ring.”
A grainy, blurry photo of two backs was attached.
My entire world narrowed down to the screen. The man in the picture, his posture, the width of his shoulders… it was Pierce. My husband, Pierce Nolan, who had been gone for eight years.
……
The thread exploded, immediately rocketing to the top of the trending list.
Some people were furious, others defended the poster.
“How is this romantic? Are you worried about the karmic backlash, lady?”
“You drove his wife to suicidal depression, and you’re bragging about it? The audacity.”
“Hold up, maybe the ex-wife was terrible. We don’t know the whole story.”
“Yeah, I think the poster is brave. In love and war, there are no rules.”
The comments section became a chaotic mess.
I gripped my phone, my knuckles white and aching.
The original poster—the mistress—replied again.
“Thanks everyone. I posted this because I’m not afraid of judgment. Love is love. I’m happy now. I just found out I’m pregnant, and my husband treats me like a queen.”
“He’s a famous entrepreneur in Newport, handsome and rich.”
The post included a picture of a delicate hand, the ring finger sporting a magnificent, pigeon-egg sized diamond.
I looked down at my own hands, dry and rough from years of neglecting myself, and it felt like a lifetime ago.
She clearly wasn’t done. She tagged Pierce.
He appeared almost instantly:
“My wife is young and tends to be dramatic. Apologies for the commotion, folks.”
She quickly shot back: “Hush! Stop embarrassing me in front of everyone!”
“Wow, they’re so sweet. Must be true love.”
“They seem like nice people; there must be a good reason he left the ex.”
“Any woman who can’t tell if her husband is alive or dead must be both stupid and toxic.”
Someone addressed Pierce directly:
“Sir, have you ever contacted your ex-wife since you faked your death? Is she okay?”
Pierce was silent for a long time. He didn't answer.
My head was spinning, a toxic cocktail of betrayal, fury, and utter humiliation burning through my veins.
Just then, a notification popped up on a messaging app:
“How are you holding up?”
I froze.
This account had been sending me short, restrained messages every holiday, every birthday, for the last three years: “Happy holiday. Wishing you well.”
I always replied with a polite, stiff, “Thank you.”
The familiar ellipsis would appear as they typed, only to disappear and be replaced by a single, curt, “Fine.”
Only now did I realize that the profile picture was from the same artistic series Pierce used for his old accounts.
I stared at the picture and laughed—a dry, humorless sound that quickly cracked into sobs.
This was the eighth year he’d been gone, the eighth year I’d spent drowning in guilt and regret.
He cheated, he lied, he faked his death, and now he asks how I am?
I blocked the number, then went back to the viral thread.
“Thank you all.”
“I’m sorry to say it, but the ‘stupid and toxic ex-wife’ is me.”
The entire thread went silent. Even Pierce and that woman stopped typing.
I already knew who she was.
Willow Chan. She was a student my mother had sponsored years ago.
The girl who had once knelt on our doorstep, weeping, promising to repay our kindness for a lifetime.
“WHOA! Ex-wife is here?!”
“OMG, please tell us everything! We need the tea!”
But I was too exhausted to reply.
The man I loved most, the girl my mother treated like a daughter. They had conspired to ruin me for eight years.
I stayed up all night. A thousand chaotic thoughts swirled: I wanted to storm their home, to scream, to lash out. I wanted to die again.
But by morning, a strange, cold calm had settled over me.
I reopened the thread, which was now a global news item.
“Since you all want to hear it, I’ll tell you my story.”
The first time I saw Pierce, he was rail-thin, practically starving.
I was twenty-eight; he was twenty-one. His parents were gone, and his few relatives were pushing him away like damaged goods.
My mother, Eleanor, took me to an inner-city school to pick the next student we would sponsor.
I saw him immediately. He stood by a broken chain-link fence, his jaw set, his eyes burning with defiant ambition.
I decided then that Pierce didn't belong in that despair.
“Him,” I said, pointing.
My mother asked, “Are you sure you don’t want to see the others?”
“No,” I said. “Just him.”
That decision became the knot that tied our lives together for the next decade.
It was Valentine’s Day. I brought him a small box of expensive chocolates.
“For you,” I told him. “A celebration of a new start.”
He took the box, his hands trembling slightly.
“Reese,” he said, his voice husky, “I swear, no matter how far I go, I will never forget you.”
He was brilliant and worked tirelessly. He got into an Ivy League school, but by his sophomore year, he refused any more money from my family.
He studied and simultaneously started a small business. Within three years, he was a known name in logistics and international trading.
The day of his graduation, he brought a huge bouquet of white lilies, knelt on one knee, and offered me a ring.
“Reese,” he said. “You were the only light in my darkness. All I want is to keep you safe for the rest of my life.”
Pierce was always a man of few words, but he always followed through.
People would gossip, saying I was too old and plain for the handsome, up-and-coming Pierce Nolan. They called me the ‘Golden Ticket’ he rode to success.
Pierce overheard one of them. That night, he beat the man so badly he landed in the ICU, and Pierce landed in the precinct.
When I picked him up, his face was bruised, but he smiled through the pain and wiped my tears.
“Why are you crying? You gave me my life. Dying for you would be worth it.”
I said yes that day.
We set the wedding for the following Valentine’s Day.
“And then what? Did you get married as planned?”
I lowered my eyes.
“No. He ran.”
Pierce, who had been silent, suddenly posted:
“Reese, stop this.”
“Why should I?”
“Don’t listen to him, Ex-wife! The mistress was so vicious, and he didn't stop her!”
“He ran? Where did he go? Why did he bail?”
I ignored Pierce and kept typing.
“Every single guest knew the groom had disappeared. I was the old woman, publicly abandoned.”
Pierce reappeared three days later. He knelt before me and begged for forgiveness.
He said he’d never experienced anything that grand, that he was terrified.
He said he felt he didn’t deserve me and panicked.
He blamed his parents’ failed marriage for giving him a phobia of commitment.
He promised to never hurt me again.
I looked at his red, swollen eyes and my resolve crumbled.
“The wedding doesn’t matter,” I whispered. “As long as we’re together.”
The next day, we quietly went to City Hall and got married. No ceremony, no guests.
Pierce held me tightly.
“Reese, I will only ever love you.”
Those were my happiest months.
Until my mother sponsored another student: Willow Chan.
Suddenly, the always-busy Pierce found time to drop by my mother's home.
I would sometimes find him and Willow sitting close, talking. They would reminisce about their humble beginnings, their shared memories of rural life—the stars, the simple food, the coldness of city people. They seemed like kindred spirits.
One day, Pierce told me, “Willow can’t stay with Mom indefinitely. She’s not family.”
A cold sliver of resentment pricked my heart. My mother, Eleanor, was elderly but had the long-time housekeeper, Doris, to help. Pierce’s comment felt manipulative, implying my mother was taking advantage.
But I conceded: “Fine. You handle it.”
He leased a small apartment near his office for Willow, claiming he didn’t want her to feel like she was ’begging for shelter.’ He even hired her as his personal assistant at his growing firm, Apex Group.
I was four months pregnant then.
Willow stood next to Pierce, smiling sweetly at me. “Reese, don’t worry, I’ll take good care of your husband.”
I missed the predatory glint in her eyes.
Then came the next Valentine’s Day. I went to Pierce’s office to bring him a pot of my mother’s famous homemade soup.
I pushed the office door open and saw them locked in a desperate kiss.
“Pierce,” Willow whispered breathlessly. “Do you do this with Reese at home?”
Pierce’s voice was low and rough:
“She’s not like you young girls. She’s… not as good at playing the game.”
The ceramic bowl slipped from my hands and shattered on the polished floor.
I was shaking, reaching for a sharp piece of ceramic, ready to lunge.
Pierce instinctively shoved me away, shielding Willow.
I fell onto the broken shards. My palm sliced open, but I didn’t feel the pain.
Pierce looked down at me with cold fury.
“Reese. Are you done with the drama? You’re getting old, turning into a shrew, and embarrassing me at the office.”
A sharp, stabbing pain twisted in my abdomen. I grabbed for his leg.
“Hospital… take me to the hospital… the baby…”
Pierce hesitated for a fraction of a second. Willow seized it.
She held out her hand, a delicate, practiced tremble in her voice. “Pierce, my hand is burned, look! Will it leave a scar?”
He immediately took her hand, soothing her softly, before turning a chilling gaze back to me.
“You brought this on yourself.”
He left with her, without looking back.
That night, I lost the baby.
Blood saturated my dress, the sheets, my memory.
I lay in the sterile hospital bed, my pillow wet with tears.
Pierce finally arrived a week later. Willow was with him.
“Reese, our marriage was never fair. I’m seven years younger than you.”
“What man doesn’t want someone younger and fresher?”
“But Willow isn’t trying to steal your position. She’s just grateful to me, just like I was grateful to you once.”
I laughed, a horrible sound that turned into weeping.
Gratitude. That’s all the vows, the promises, the protection had ever been.
I had never felt such gut-wrenching shame. The love in my heart slowly curdled into pure hatred.
After I was discharged, I went straight to Apex Group. I fired Willow Chan and immediately cut off all my mother’s family’s financial support to her.
“The past four years of tuition and living expenses total sixty thousand dollars. Pay it back to the company account within one week. I won't bother with the gifts.”
“Also, anyone who is blacklisted by the Nolan family will never work in Newport again.”
Willow screamed, her face contorted:
“You old hag! You’re just jealous of me!”
Pierce rushed in and pulled her behind him.
“Reese, have you lost your mind? At your age, who will want you if you leave me?”
“Willow just graduated, and you’re terrorizing her. You’re a nasty piece of work.”
If reclaiming what was mine made me nasty, I gladly wore the label.
“If you want Apex Group to stay open, Willow leaves Newport.”
I walked out, holding onto a sliver of desperate hope. If he came after me, if he chose me, I would forgive him.
But Pierce chose Willow.
Even when I pulled a huge percentage of my family’s investment out of his company, he kept her close.
He drove Apex Group into debt, throwing money at her, once spending thousands on a fireworks display just because she casually mentioned she “liked to watch them explode.”
The final straw: when Willow got pregnant, Pierce transferred a significant portion of the company’s stock to her name and demanded a divorce.
I finally snapped and told my mother everything.
Eleanor was furious. She leveraged our family’s connections to crush Apex Group.
Pierce’s company quickly imploded, drowning in debt.
Desperate, he came back to me.
He sent Willow away, falling to his knees and groveling for forgiveness.
My mother, still enraged, assigned him to oversee a dangerous construction site, picking the hardest, filthiest jobs.
Pierce took it all without complaint. He seemed to transform back into the devoted man he once was, fulfilling my every petty request.
I tested him daily, making him run ridiculous errands, wait in freezing lines, and stay up all night to buy me desserts.
Then, my mother's company was sabotaged.
The capital chain snapped, and she was facing bankruptcy overnight.
The shock triggered a massive heart attack. She was rushed to the ICU.
Those were the most desperate days of my life.
I expected Pierce to take his revenge, but he didn't.
He stayed by Mom’s bedside, managed the chaotic household, and even physically fought off the debt collectors, his arm badly cut in several places.
Slowly, the ice in my heart began to thaw.
“You look exhausted…” I whispered one night. “You’ve been through hell.”
He gripped my hand.
“I promised I’d protect you forever, Reese.”
I cried for a long time that night. I told him: “I want that dessert from the bakery downtown.”
He nodded. “Done.”
I had actually written out the divorce papers that day. With my mother’s business ruined, I couldn't bear to drag him down anymore.
But I never saw him again.
What I got instead was a call from the police:
“Ms. Nolan? Your husband was in an accident on the way to the bakery. His vehicle went over the bridge and into the river. We haven’t recovered his body…”
The rapid succession of trauma shattered me. I was diagnosed with severe depression. I attempted to take my life multiple times, ending up in a locked ward.
Now I understand. It was all Pierce’s play.
The crash. The faked death. Even my mother's company’s ruin was likely his doing.
For eight years, I lived in soul-crushing guilt, convinced my selfishness had killed him. Those memories were my prison, forging him into a perfect, unattainable phantom in my mind.
Now I know the truth.
After the initial burst of anger, a strange lightness settled over me.
It wasn’t my fault.
The love I had for him died the day he cheated. The last eight years were just the haunting ghost of misplaced guilt.
“@PierceNolan, get out here! Is this true or not?”
“@PierceNolan, why the silent treatment now?”
The internet was in an uproar.
As I finished typing, the last of my rage drained away.
“Thank you, everyone. No need to tag him.”
“Whether he is alive or dead, he is no longer relevant to me.”
I typed the final line, stood up, and walked toward the door to leave the house.
The door burst open.
Pierce stood there. His eyes were bloodshot, and his voice was rough with emotion.
“What do you mean, ‘no longer relevant’?”
“Reese, how dare you decide what's relevant to me?”
