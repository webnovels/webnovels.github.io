For four years, my wife Victoria, who rarely posted on SnapChat, suddenly updated her feed:

[Whose clumsy little puppy is this who loves to play?]

The picture showed a guy in a white shirt and jeans, pouting and hugging a puppy plushie while sitting in a gaming chair.

It was Finn, a new idol from her company.

I was staring, lost in thought, when a mutual friend commented below:

“Girl, you forgot to switch accounts!”

A few seconds later, Victoria’s post vanished completely. But not long after, it reappeared on Finn’s Ins profile.

Victoria called me immediately.

In the past, I’d have already screenshotted it, been absolutely livid, and rushed to confront Victoria, raising hell until the whole house shook.

But this time, I just quietly watched the screen, waiting for the call to disconnect itself.
