I used all my savings to give my brother a decent funeral. As I knelt there, expressing my grief, the door to the mourning hall was slammed open. Finn and Adeline stormed in aggressively. "Has Finn's Family fallen so low? The funeral is so shabby. You may not care about your reputation, but Finn's Family does." It was his usual condescending accusation. "Jasper liked it simple." I wanted them gone quickly, so I explained, holding back my nausea. "He's at peace now, but what will outsiders think of Finn? They might think Finn's Family is bankrupt and can't afford a funeral." Adeline looked around the mourning hall with disdain. The chrysanthemums on the floor were crushed under her high heels: "What cheap flowers? It's embarrassing." My knees were numb from kneeling, but I straightened my back and wiped my tears: "Are you done? Please leave." Finn sneered, pulling out a document from his suit jacket and tossing it in front of me. "Sign it." The bold letters on the document, "Body Donation Agreement," stabbed my eyes. The terms stated that Jasper's body would be donated to Finn Corporation for research. "No way!" I lunged forward, flinging the document far away. Finn frowned, pulled his hands from his pockets, and pinned me down. "Cora, don't push your luck. You're here to atone. What right do you have to refuse?" I struggled: "He's just a child, only 12. He never had a good life. Let him rest in peace, please?"

"Sign it." The title "Body Donation Agreement" leaped out at me, piercing my heart. The terms dictated that Jasper's body was to be donated to Finn Corporation for research.

"Over my dead body!" I surged forward, knocking the document away.

Finn frowned, pulling his hand from his pocket to restrain me firmly.

"Cora, don't be ungrateful. You're here to make amends. What right do you have to refuse?"

I struggled, "He's just a child, only 12 years old. He's never had a chance to live fully. Can't you let him rest in peace?"

I pleaded, tears falling like a broken string of beads.

"Lydia was only eighteen when you caused her death."

"It wasn't me," I sobbed.

"Cora," Adeline's tone shifted from provocative to persuasive. "The spinal fluid of ALS patients is incredibly valuable. Jasper is contributing to medical research, and Finn Corporation stands to gain significantly."

A chill ran through my veins. Finn spared neither me nor my brother. My brother believed his death would save me, yet he died without peace, and I continued to live in torment.

Finn tightened his grip. "Will you sign?"

He raised his phone, displaying children playing joyfully at Harmony Haven Orphanage.

"I'll sign." Tears blotched the agreement, and only then did Finn release his hold.

I signed my name on every line, feeling as though I was consigning my brother to hell once more.

After everyone left, I knelt again before the altar.

Tears flowed freely as memories surged like a tide.

Five years ago, Finn treated me with gentle kindness.

My adoptive father and Finn's family were long-time friends. After adopting me, they arranged a marriage with Finn's family.

Finn and I fell in love and agreed readily.

We had ten years of beautiful memories as a couple.

Until the day five years ago when Lydia and I went on a yacht trip, and she accidentally fell into the sea.

Adeline was there too, the so-called "false witness," Lydia's best friend.

She claimed she saw everything—that I pushed Lydia during an argument.

But the police found no evidence of foul play by me.

Finn married me as planned. I thought he believed me, not realizing it marked the beginning of a life in hell.

Thunder rolled outside the funeral parlor. I caressed my brother's photo.

In the picture, he was forever the smiling twelve-year-old.

"Dear brother, you never burdened your sister. Your existence gave me the will to live..."

Suddenly, footsteps approached. I turned quickly.

Finn had returned.

"Cora! Do you think signing the agreement is the end?"

He walked closer, his tone still condescending.

"What more do you want?" I asked warily.

"If you die, these children will accompany you to the grave."

He pulled out a USB drive. The computer screen showed the orphanage managing a small fire, quickly brought under control.

"This is just the beginning."

"You can't repay what you owe Lydia. If you dare to die, go ahead and try."

I froze, questioning if the person before me was human or a demon. He blocked my last escape route.

I laughed bitterly, "Finn, you keep saying I killed Lydia. What was my motive?"

He hesitated, unable to fathom why I would harm my innocent sister-in-law when I was about to marry into his family.

He hadn't considered this in five years.

"You're just vile. Evil needs no reason."

His voice rose, as if to convince himself.

"Do you want to know what she said to me before she died?"

Finn's eyes turned cold. "What did Lydia say?"

I closed my eyes. "I'll exchange that information for my brother's body."

He suddenly grabbed my collar with malice. "You dare negotiate with me?"

"Do as you like. I don't care if I die. But... you'll never hear it again."

I slowly closed my eyes, as if ready to face death.

"Fine." Seeing me in such a state, he finally let go.

Then he dusted his hands, as if fearing I might soil him.
