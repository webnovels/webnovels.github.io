My fingers trembled uncontrollably on the railing, leaving bloodstains on the wooden handrail. I knew he was ruthless, but I didn't expect him to threaten me with the lives of 123 children. Ever since his sister Lydia died, he has found new ways to torment me every day. Occasionally, when slightly drunk at night, he'd hold me tenderly, but seeing his sister's photo the next day, he'd feel guilty and become even more cruel. For five years, his words were filled with insults and abuse. He mingled with "witnesses" who accused me of causing his sister's death. My unborn child became nothing more than "unworthy" in his words. But now I understand that what I thought was the "most painful" was just the beginning. Someone like Finn, who has no boundaries, is capable of anything. In a daze, I saw my brother jump from the 27th floor. His body shuddered and fell lifeless in a pool of blood. He must have thought that with his death, his sister would be free. I also saw the scenes of my adoptive parents taking me and Jasper to volunteer at the orphanage. He knew I grew up there and had feelings for the place. So, when I was all alone, he thought of using them to threaten me. With Finn's Family's influence, they could easily manipulate public opinion. "What? Didn't you hear me, or are you scared?" Finn's devilish voice rang out. "She doesn't think she still has a choice, does she? Don't be fooled by her; she's a master at acting." Adeline's fingers lightly traced his chest, her eyes taunting me. Finn sneered and kissed her on the chin: "You're right, she's a master at acting." I clenched my fists tightly and slowly walked down the stairs, each step feeling like a descent into hell. The orphanage can't suffer; there are too many kids like Jasper and me there. They shouldn't become Finn's pawn in his revenge against me. "What do you want me to do?" Seeing his goal achieved, he extinguished his cigarette: "I want you to admit you killed Lydia." "She wasn't killed by me…" Before I could finish, just like every time in the past five years when I tried to defend myself, he'd become furious and violent. He only believed Adeline and himself. "Cora, I'm not in the mood to play with you here. Whether the orphanage kids live or die is up to you." I closed my eyes, thought for a moment, and then slowly opened them. "I killed Lydia." "Louder!" He smashed a cup against the wall, causing Adeline to flinch in his arms. "I killed Lydia!" I almost shouted. Adeline exaggeratedly said, "See, Finn? I wasn't lying to you; it really was her." He suddenly stood up, grabbed my hair, and dragged me to Adeline's feet. "Now lick her shoes clean, and say you killed Lydia while doing it." I struggled desperately, but he grabbed my hair and pressed me hard against the ground. At this moment, I was kneeling at Adeline's feet, utterly humiliated. He pulled out his phone: "I'll count to three, two, one. If you don't start, then the fire will." "Three…" "Two…" His voice was like a devil's whisper, guiding me step by step toward death. "I killed Lydia!" "Lick! What did I tell you to do?" he shouted angrily, sending chills down my spine. Adeline lifted her high heel at the right moment. My lips trembled, and as my tongue touched the sole, a wave of nausea surged through me. My stomach churned again, but I endured it, licking over and over. Adeline was full of delight, deliberately brushing her high heel against my face. Finn leaned on the sofa, smoking, his eyes filled with coldness and mockery. When I finally completed this humiliating task, I looked up. What I saw was Adeline's disdainful face and Finn's extreme disgust. "Cora, you're truly despicable. You should have swapped your life for my sister's."
