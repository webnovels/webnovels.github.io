In the first year of our relationship, he was passionate and promised me an everlasting love.

In the second year, his vanity grew, and he began to make endless demands.

By the third year, he brought his childhood sweetheart to our engagement party.

"Nora, if you want to marry me, fine! But you'll have to settle for being the second wife!"

"Not only that, you must transfer all your shares in Quinn Enterprises to Beatrix!"

"Otherwise, there's no way I'd marry someone like you!"

After a moment of silence, I picked up my phone and dialed.

"Grandpa, this guy isn't working out. Find me someone obedient and sensible."
