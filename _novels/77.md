I was a renowned surgeon at Seaside Hospital. Three years ago, I fainted on the operating table due to an allergic reaction, and the patient couldn't be saved from the excessive bleeding. As the lead surgeon, I was prosecuted and sent to prison because of the family's influence, enduring three years of unimaginable torture.
