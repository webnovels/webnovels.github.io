In the past life, she thought she would live a luxurious life after being adopted, only to find herself eating and wearing the servants' leftovers. After marriage, she suffered daily abuse and beatings, and by the time she died, all her money amounted to no more than five hundred dollars.

She immediately blocked my way, grabbed the check, and pretended to be terrified, speaking for me:

"Sir, please don't say that. My older sister didn't just stand there; she cheered for me from the shore. Without her, I would've lost the strength to stay afloat long ago..."

I watched her performance quietly, waiting for the chance to deliver a decisive blow.

I smiled and asked, "Sister, since you're so good at swimming, why don't you jump into the river now and show us a frog kick?"

My Sister's expression froze.

The Media Mogul snorted, "What do you mean, are you saying that you were the one who saved me?"

I pressed my lips together, and in the next second, I dove into the water, holding my breath for a full minute before resurfacing. Seeing my Sister's face turn from blue to pale, I said calmly, "Your turn, go ahead."

She couldn't hold it any longer, screaming sharply, wishing to tear me apart:

"I'm your Sister! Why do you keep pushing me to the brink!"

I smiled at the Media Mogul, the truth was now evident. He was so furious that he clutched his chest, unable to speak, pointing at my Sister.

But given that she had been his Adopted Daughter for years, she knew he was soft-hearted, so she knelt down with a thud, crying bitterly:

"I'm sorry, sir, I lied just now! But I have my reasons! My older sister has always liked being in the limelight.

When we were kids, and the orphanage director taught us to swim, I was better, so she grew jealous.

She pushed me into the water when no one was looking, and I almost drowned. Since then, I've been afraid of water...

"And she loves brand ads. She only saved you because she noticed your belt was Hermès. Otherwise, she wouldn't have cared..."

I truly admired her ability to lie on the spot. The Media Mogul looked at her in shock, half-believing her words.

Eventually, he still appreciated her impressive creative talent and agreed to help her find an agency to sign with.

That afternoon, we boarded the Media Mogul's private jet to San Francisco. My Sister leaned over, smiling, and said, "Older sister, your good days have finally arrived. This life, you deserve it.

"And I will be just like in the past life, becoming that Famous Actress in the spotlight."

She looked at me arrogantly, thinking it would terrify me, but unexpectedly, from start to finish, I just watched her with a smile.

Newcomers pop up in Hollywood all the time. Where does she get the confidence to think she can rely on just one song to stay popular forever? Someone this foolish, even a thousand Rebirths wouldn't help.
