Although Madam Daphne was skeptical, she couldn't ignore the detailed information I provided. She informed Mr. Bennett, and they investigated the company's situation.

They indeed discovered a major issue: several executives had been secretly contacting competitors.

The company was about to enter an important bidding process, and failure would result in significant losses.

Mr. Bennett and Madam Daphne were shocked and immediately cleaned house from top to bottom. Within a week, I saved Gideon Bennett's life and helped the company avoid enormous losses.

Media Moguls are often superstitious, and the wealthier they are, the more they believe in fate. Now they almost all believe that I was sent by fate to bring them luck.

At a family dinner, Madam Daphne seriously asked me, "Tell me, what do you want?"

I placed my hand over my heart and sincerely said to her, "I am already the adopted daughter of the Bennett Family.

I want nothing but for the Bennett Family to prosper and for my father and mother to enjoy peace and happiness."

It was the first time I proactively called them "father" and "mother." Madam Daphne didn't refuse; instead, she embraced me with excitement. I knew that from this moment, the doors of the Bennett Family were truly open to me.
