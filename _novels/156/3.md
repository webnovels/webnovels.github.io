I followed the Media Mogul to his home, a mansion in the heart of the city, comparable to a royal garden.

The steps were made of white jade, and the railings were inlaid with gold. This top-tier Media Mogul lived more lavishly than I imagined.

But I knew well that everyone in High Society is shrewd, so I showed no interest in anything, appearing indifferent the entire time.

At lunch, I used my past life's etiquette to appear generous and graceful. The Media Mogul, who had been observing me, finally showed a satisfied smile.

He gestured for the servants to serve me food and began to ask about my life:

"As my daughter, I won't treat you poorly. You'll receive a seven-figure monthly allowance, and there will be dedicated staff to take care of your daily needs. You'll never have to go back to the life you had before.

"However, as my daughter, I hope you'll be diligent, know your limits, and become a good helper for your father in the future."

I looked up as a well-dressed, well-maintained middle-aged woman walked in briskly, her eyes almost spitting fire. I recognized her immediately as the Media Mogul's legitimate wife, Madam Daphne.

"Gideon Bennett, who's this child you've brought in this time?"

In the past, I learned that Madam Daphne was a wealthy heiress who insisted on marrying the Media Mogul and supported his business with her entire family. As they say, heroes can't resist beautiful women, and the Media Mogul did have a few scandals in his younger days, making her wary.

Seeing the Media Mogul's face darken, I stood up first to introduce myself:

"Hello, Madam, my name is Nora Bennett, the Adopted Daughter of Mr. Bennett."

She snorted, mocking, "Adopted Daughter? I guess I'll have to give up my position as Madam soon since you're the first one Gideon Bennett has brought home directly in years."

"Ah Feng! What nonsense are you spouting?!" The Media Mogul finally couldn't keep his expression in check.

I smiled slightly, stood up, and pulled out a chair for Madam Daphne, respectfully serving her food and soup.

She sneered at my actions but didn't stop taunting:

"Oh, so you've done your homework on me. Too bad, I'm not Summer, and I won't like you just because you're pretty and diligent."

But as the aroma of the food wafted over, her nose twitched slightly. The Media Mogul noticed this and couldn't help but smile.

In the past life, out of gratitude for the Media Mogul's kindness, I carefully learned Madam Daphne's preferences. I knew she had a big temper but wasn't a bad person.

Every time I gave her gifts, she would return the gesture. Once, when I faced a media crisis, she spoke on my behalf in front of reporters.

I also learned that when she was young, she helped Mr. Bennett sell goods at a stall. Once, she was accidentally hit on the neck by merchandise, narrowly escaping death, which left her with chronic issues.

Thinking of this, I gently placed my hand on her neck.

Madam Daphne instinctively flinched, "What are you doing!?"

But then she suddenly felt an indescribable comfort and relaxation, and couldn't help but loosen up.

"I grew up in an orphanage. Although the director and teachers gave us a lot of love, I still learned to be cautious from a young age, striving to be a likable child."

I massaged her shoulders and neck earnestly, speaking slowly:

"Being likable meant I could get an extra piece of meat in the cafeteria, gain more knowledge when asking teachers questions after class, and receive more love.

"The director, who raised us herself, was like a mother to me. She worked tirelessly every day, suffering from severe shoulder and neck issues. I would massage her every day...

"Every time I did it, I felt incredibly happy. It was like having a home, massaging my hardworking mother."

As I spoke, I could sense the person's breathing in front of me tremble slightly. Madam Daphne had no children, but I knew she longed for one more than anyone.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Mr. Bennett watching me intently. Our eyes met, and his expression softened, nodding towards me.

I understood well that the reason Gideon Bennett agreed to fulfill my Sister and my wishes wasn't just out of gratitude. More importantly, he valued our outstanding appearances, thinking we could be of use to him in the future.

He must have been aware of how my Sister lived in the past. The only explanation is that he allowed it to happen.

If I couldn't be of real help to him, my fate would likely be no different than my Sister's past life.

That night, I brought red wine to Madam Daphne's room on behalf of the servants. She was smoking, and when she saw me, she raised an eyebrow and slowly got up to open the window.

"At this hour, you're looking for me? Aren't you enjoying the luxury room Gideon arranged for you?"

Her words were still sharp, but they were quite different from the day. There was no longer an attempt to associate me with Gideon and slander me.

My elder sister surely knew about the hardships my sister faced in her previous life. The only explanation is that she allowed it all to happen.

If I can't be of real assistance to her, I fear my fate could mirror that of my sister's past.

That evening, I took a glass of red wine to Madam Daphne's room on behalf of the servant. She was smoking and, upon seeing me, raised an eyebrow and slowly opened the window.

"Why are you here at this hour? Aren't you going to enjoy the luxurious room that Gideon Bennett arranged for you?"

Her words were as sharp as ever, but there was a noticeable difference compared to earlier in the day. She no longer associated me negatively with Gideon Bennett.

"Madam, I have no interest in your assets. I'm willing to sign an agreement to ensure I have no inheritance rights." Meeting her astonished gaze, I stated clearly, "I'm here to help you avert a crisis."

In my past life, the main reason my sister married such a despicable person was that the Bennett Corporation faced a severe crisis.

Otherwise, even as an adopted daughter, she was the Bennett Family's only daughter, representing their image, and Gideon Bennett wouldn't have treated her marriage so lightly.

Madam Daphne took a drag from her cigarette and turned to the window, chuckling softly, "Our Bennett Family is large and conducts business with integrity. What help could you possibly provide?"

I concealed a smile. "There's no doubt about Bennett Corporation's strength. But it can't withstand an insider selling company secrets to competitors."

I took out a pen and paper and wrote down a few names. These people caused chaos in the industry by betraying the Bennett Corporation in my past life, and it's hard for anyone not to have heard of them.

Madam Daphne casually glanced at the names, and her expression changed dramatically.

I said, "Maybe you don't believe me, but I've had a knack since childhood for reading people and distinguishing good from evil.

On my way here, I researched news related to Bennett Corporation. You should pay particular attention to the people on this list."
