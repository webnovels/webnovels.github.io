Since I just took over the corporation, I wasn't familiar with many things.

After saying that, I turned and left the engagement scene, heading toward the corporation.

On the way, I called my assistant to handle the apartment Declan and I used to live in.

The assistant quickly got to work after receiving the task.

By noon, the down payment had been transferred to my account.

Just as I was about to go downstairs for lunch, I saw Declan and Beatrix angrily blocking the office door.

The moment Declan saw me, he yelled.

"Nora! How dare you sell my apartment?!"

His question stunned me.

Before I could respond, Beatrix spoke up.

"Nora, I know you're upset with me, but that was supposed to be our future marital home. Even if you're short on cash, you can't just sell it!"

She spoke pitifully, causing concern among the employees.

A few bolder ones even stood up to criticize me.

"Miss Quinn, you don't need the money. How can you sell someone else's home for your gain?"

"Exactly! That's their marital home! Even if you want to make money, you should have some decency."

"Miss Quinn, you better return the money. If this blows up, it won't just be your reputation at stake!"

They all acted like Declan and Beatrix were victims.

But that was my apartment. When did it become theirs?

"Nora, you've never wanted for anything, but Beatrix is different. She's from the countryside!"

"You, an heiress, wouldn't understand her attachment to a home!"

"Buy the apartment back and put it in Beatrix's name before I get angry."

"Otherwise, don't expect to see me again!"

The familiar threat again.

I had no patience left for his antics.

"Assistant Liu, see them out!"

Following my order, the assistant summoned two security guards who quickly approached Declan.

Seeing I was serious, a rare panic appeared on Declan's face.

"What are you doing?! I'm telling you! Nora won't marry anyone but me! She's just messing around!"

"If you go against me, once I inherit the Quinn Enterprises, I'll fire you all first!"

He spoke with confidence, even affecting Beatrix, who stood up straighter.

"Nora is just Declan's sycophant!"

"If you dare treat Declan this way, once Nora realizes her mistake, she'll definitely fire you!"

The assistant couldn't bear it anymore, signaling the security to escort them out.

The two were yelling as they were taken out of the building.

Once their voices faded, I breathed a sigh of relief.

Over the past three years, to play the sycophant role well, I indulged him countless times.

When he went on dates with his childhood sweetheart, I planned their itineraries, bought tickets, and booked hotels.

Once, he called me from abroad, and I flew to Paris just to bring him a pack of domestic brand condoms.

I'll never forget how disgusted he looked when he held my face.

"Nora, how can an heiress like you become such a disgrace?"

His words were harsh.

But at that time, I was at a critical point in acquiring shares of Quinn Enterprises.

To avoid alerting anyone, I had to pretend ignorance.

I giggled foolishly.

"Because I love you. I'll do anything to make you happy!"
