Grandpa's call interrupted my thoughts.

As soon as I answered, his voice came through.

"Nora, the family has chosen a marriage partner for you. He's returned to the country, and tonight we'll announce your engagement to everyone in the circle."

"When is the engagement?"

"The day after tomorrow."

"Alright."

Not long after hanging up, Grandpa spread the news of my engagement throughout the Manhattan Elite Circle.

A few friends called as soon as they heard.

"Nora, are you crazy?! After everything he's done, you're still going to marry him? How long are you going to be infatuated?"

"Nora, if you still consider me a friend, break up with him! You can't find another man with two legs?"

"Nora, I beg you! Stop being a sycophant!"

Their scolding made me chuckle.

But to avoid misunderstandings, I explained.

"The groom isn't Declan."

"Really?"

"Yeah, it's a family-arranged marriage. Declan doesn't deserve it."

"That's more like it! Nora, if you really married him, I'd laugh at you forever!"

After chatting with my friends, I hung up.

Maybe I angered him.

Or for some other reason.

During the two days of preparing for the engagement, Declan surprisingly didn't show up.

Until the engagement day.

When I arrived at the designated five-star hotel in my formal attire, I immediately saw Declan in a suit and tie.

He stood at the entrance like when we first met.

The only difference was the presence of Beatrix by his side.

Seeing them at my engagement entrance, I frowned.

"What are you doing here?"

"Why pretend? You've told everyone about our engagement. How could I not come?"

His words amused me.

"I'm engaging with you?"

"Nora, you're getting more shameless!"

"You insist on taking Beatrix's place, and now you won't admit it! Don't you have any sense of shame?"

Beatrix, on the side, gently rubbed Declan's shoulder.

"Declan, Nora just loves you too much. She didn't mean to act without your consent."

"Besides, even if you two get married, Nora won't mind us being together, right?"

She looked at me pitifully.

Her shamelessness made me laugh.

"Beatrix, if you have problems, go deal with them. Don't cause a scene at my engagement, alright?"

My words infuriated Declan.

"Nora! What nonsense are you spouting?!"

"Apologize to Beatrix immediately! Or you'll never marry me today!"

"Declan, Nora acted without your permission because her feelings for you are overwhelming."

"Besides, even if you two were to marry, Nora wouldn't object to us being together, right?"

As she said this, she looked at me with an expression of feigned vulnerability.

I couldn't help but laugh at her audacity.

"Beatrix, if there's something wrong with your thinking, get it checked. Don't create a scene at my engagement party, alright?"

As soon as I said that, Declan's temper flared.

"Nora! What nonsense are you spouting?!"

"Apologize to Beatrix immediately! Otherwise, there will be no engagement today!"

Declan's voice was loud, drawing the attention of everyone around us.

Yet, he seemed unaware of the crowd.

He glared at me intensely.

"Nora! Apologize!"

"Declan, please don't blame Nora. Her words come from her strong feelings for you!"

Beatrix said, turning her gaze to me again.

"Nora, just concede and avoid making Declan any angrier."

"Beatrix, someone like her doesn't deserve your defense!"

"And you, Nora! Don't push me to the point where I have to slap you in front of everyone!"

I wasn't intimidated, meeting his eyes directly.

"Oh, really? Go ahead and try!"

Just as I finished speaking, Declan raised his hand to strike me.

A gust of air passed by, and I instinctively closed my eyes.

But just as the slap was about to land, a pair of strong hands caught Declan's arm.

"Trying to slap my fiancée in front of everyone? Are you looking for trouble?"

The unexpected voice caused Declan to momentarily freeze.
