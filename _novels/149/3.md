I was silent for a long time.

Tyler acted the same as before, coming to help at the store when I was busy. People who saw him would envy me, saying how lucky I was.

In the past, I would have been overjoyed, happy for a long time.

But now when I heard those words, they just sounded grating.

One day he sent me a message saying a friend wanted to discuss using my store as a filming location. Unlike his usual one-word replies, his message seemed very excited.

Before I could refuse, I saw a woman enter the store at night, surrounded by an entourage.

She was dressed low-key but couldn't hide her air of nobility. Afraid of being recognized, she wore a mask and hat, and brought several assistants and bodyguards.

She covered her nose in disgust, looked around, and zeroed in on me. Then she carefully walked over.

"It's so dirty. My shoes have wool soles. One pair could buy your whole store."

I looked down at the floor. I had just finished cleaning, but they had tracked dirt in again.

"So you're Lily."

She looked me up and down, the contempt and disdain clear in her eyes.

She only needed to give a look, and her assistant understood, handing me a contract and explaining their purpose.

"I don't agree."

"Didn't Tyler tell you? Don't be ungrateful!"

She seemed surprised I would refuse her, giving me a disdainful look.

My refusal didn't matter anyway.

Tyler had put up more than half the money for this barbecue restaurant.

I knew I couldn't refuse, but my heart was heavy, a bitter taste in my mouth.

When we got married, Tyler promised me that I was his lifesaver, that he would never let me down or force me to do anything, that he would always stand by my side, and even... love me forever.

Now I no longer dared hope for his love, but I still remembered his promises.

Now he had agreed on my behalf, sending me a message telling me to be good and listen.

He said this was a chance to make big money.

How could I not know that?

I tried to act like the lady of the house, but now it just seemed ridiculous. I was supposed to be Tyler's wife.

The assistant was already pressuring me to sign. I could only give in.

The group came in a grand procession and left the same way.

As they were leaving, I heard someone say: "What a dump. Poor Rachel having to film here."

It was actually very clean.

I looked at the new footprints they had left, raising my hand to wipe away the tears on my face.
