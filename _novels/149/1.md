Many people said I, Lily, was lucky and blessed. I was an orphan who ended up with a good life and a great husband.

My husband, Tyler, was considered by everyone to be an excellent man.

As for me, I was just a barbecue stand owner, always smelling of smoke and grease. I was truly punching above my weight.

I used to think I had hit the jackpot too.

I remember that year when I was 18. My grandfather and I were closing up shop and heading home when we found a half-dead man in a filthy alley while taking out the trash.

Grandpa, being kind-hearted, helped me bring him back home.

The man had a gentle demeanor, his every gesture showing he wasn't from our working-class background.

But he had nowhere else to go.

Later I found out he was actually the young master of the Tang family. His family had gone bankrupt, and he was being hunted by rivals. He had barely escaped to our neighborhood, where I happened to find him.

Love often starts unexpectedly and grows deep.

We let him stay, and mutual feelings developed between us. We got married and had a daughter, as if it was meant to be.

I'm 38 now, no longer with the graceful figure and pretty face of my youth. He, on the other hand, has become more mature and charming. What comforts me is that I wasn't wrong about him - he's still as good to me as ever.

Everyone says I have good judgment and luck, but only I know he has an idealized first love he could never have.

One night, I heard him moaning in his sleep, his brows furrowed, his expression panicked.

"Rachel, don't leave me. I promise I'll marry you..."

My hand froze as I was about to cover him with a blanket. I immediately went online to search for that name.

Rachel, the youngest daughter of the Ruan family, now a big celebrity.

Beautiful and passionate, she was Tyler's childhood sweetheart before the Tang family went bankrupt.

When I came back to my senses, tears were already falling down my face.

That year, our daughter was 3 years old. Daily chores had already left fine lines on my face. I gritted my teeth, struggling internally, but life had to go on.

Perhaps their feelings had faded with time, just a lingering obsession from their youth.

I tried to comfort myself.

If only I hadn't seen his unsent letters.
