Grandpa was getting old, so I took over his barbecue business. In recent years, it's been growing steadily, as if blessed by good fortune.

With Tyler's help, I used my savings to buy a storefront. Tyler would come help out when he had time.

He started a small company, getting back into his old line of work, showing signs of making a comeback.

One day I finished work early and returned home, unexpectedly seeing an unsealed envelope on his desk.

The words inside were full of love for Rachel, the humble tone making my heart ache.

"My beloved Rachel: How are you? I have so much I want to tell you, only words can express my love. Lately, I often fantasize about chasing the sunrise with you. I dreamed of that summer years ago..."

"Just thinking of your name makes my heart surge like a tidal wave. My body may have been defiled, but my heart has always remained pure for you..."

"I will definitely succeed, Rachel. Wait for me."

My heart felt like it was being squeezed, so sour I could barely breathe. Sorrow welled up, tears hanging at the corners of my eyes.

I remembered when Luna had just started elementary school. She came home saying her language teacher had written many poems and love letters for her husband, and they were very loving.

I looked at Tyler expectantly, but he just held me in his arms, saying our love didn't need flowery words to decorate it. As long as I could see his true heart, that was enough.

But now, the hundreds of envelopes in this study felt like slaps to my face.

So it turns out Rachel was worth it, and I wasn't.

My legs went weak, and I slid down against the desk.

Luna heard the noise and came to find me in the study, throwing herself into my arms:

"Mom, what's wrong?"

"Mom, don't cry. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have played on my phone in secret."

Luna had grown taller, her eyes looking just like her father's.

Luna wasn't wrong. I was the one who was wrong.

I was wrong to hold onto false hope, thinking I could keep him.

I was wrong to overestimate myself.

It turns out all these years of love were fake.

So what were Luna and I to him?
