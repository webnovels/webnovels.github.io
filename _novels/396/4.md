The entire floor of the riverside rooftop restaurant was empty.
A waiter pushed open the glass door for me. A cascade of roses bloomed profusely, and amidst them, stood Valerie, dressed in a white gown.
She walked toward me, a dazzling smile on her face. “Happy Birthday, Alex.”
I was slightly stunned. It was my birthday today? I’d even forgotten myself…
She explained that she had deliberately been distant these past few days to prepare this surprise for me.
Valerie took a necklace from a box in her hand and fastened it around my neck. As our skin brushed, I felt her breath near my ear. “Alex, this is our ninth year.”
She wrapped her arms around my waist, leaning gently against me. “And we’ll have many, many more nine years together.”
I almost froze, unable to move for a long time.
A sudden, intense bitterness welled up inside me. *But Valerie… we don’t have a future anymore.*
She took my hand and led me to the table. A waiter poured our wine.
Valerie raised her glass to me. “Alex…”
She suddenly smiled shyly. For a moment, I saw the ghost of her eighteen-year-old self. “Have I ever told you?”
I frowned, asking, “What?”
Valerie’s expression grew serious. “I love you.”
My heart lurched, then pounded in my chest with endless echoes.
Valerie’s affection had always been quiet, almost shy. Never had she expressed it with such passionate, direct honesty.
This was the first time.
Her cheeks flushed. She took a sip of her wine, using it to hide her nervousness.
I hesitated for a moment, then drained my glass.
My stomach cramped painfully. I forced a smile, enduring the discomfort. “I’m very happy.”
She was about to say something else when a heated argument suddenly erupted nearby.
“Sir! You can’t go in!”
By the time I looked up, the man had already walked in front of us.
He looked utterly distraught, but his handsome face was still undeniable. His clothes were impeccably neat, yet he reeked of alcohol.
“Why did you fire me?”
The man’s voice was cold, yet broken, with a hint of a sob. He was fragile, like a wet, abandoned puppy, easily eliciting a protective instinct from others.
I instantly knew who he was—Valerie’s secretary, Brandon.
Brandon continued to demand, over and over, “What exactly did I do wrong? Was my presence a problem for you?”
“But you didn’t reject me then. I thought you felt something for me…”
He acted as if I wasn’t even there, passionately pouring out his heart.
Valerie’s expression gradually darkened. “Shut up.”
Only then did Brandon turn his gaze to me. He stared for a long moment, then gave a bitter laugh. “I see.”
He turned and walked away, a look of grim determination on his face.
Valerie instinctively rose to stop him. I looked up at her. “Valerie.”
My eyes suddenly stung. I asked, almost pleading, “Are you leaving?”
She faltered. I gripped her fingertips, forcing a difficult smile as tears traced paths down my cheeks.
“Please, don’t go.”
Valerie’s eyes flickered with struggle. After a few seconds, it turned to apology. “I’m sorry.”
She chased after him. In that vast restaurant, I was the only one left, the only ‘star’ of her show.
I stood there for a long time, then covered my eyes with my hand, letting the tears soak my palm, before a low, bitter laugh escaped me.
If you’d known this was the last birthday you’d spend with me, would you regret it?
Valerie, I almost fell for it. Almost.
