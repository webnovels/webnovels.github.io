Rhys Kincaid, my husband, told me he was a 'Narrative Corrector', the linchpin who would lead me to save the world from the Xylosian Swarm. He promised I would stand beside him, revered by the masses.

Now, I was a captive of the Swarm, ravaged and parasitized, my body a living incubator for alien spawn.

In the throes of sheer, blinding despair, I subconsciously forced a connection to Rhys's secure comm-channel.

I heard his conversation with the World-Mind, the cosmic conscience of our reality.

“Rhys,” the voice echoed, laced with urgency, “I tasked you with correcting the timeline to save the world. Why, then, have you delivered your own wife to the Swarm?”

Rhys’s tone was cold, clinical.

“My trade with the Swarm ensures the world’s survival.”

“They originally requested Willow, but she’s too delicate. She wouldn’t survive the production process. Besides, she and I share a co-life contract. Rowan Maxwell had to substitute. Once this is over, I will compensate her.”

It was him. The man who had sworn to protect me was the one who had condemned me to this hell.

As the alien creatures violated my body to implant their eggs, I closed my eyes, the fight draining out of me...

1

“Initiating the delivery of the three-hundred and sixty-seventh spawn!”

Something vast and foul writhed inside me. A tearing, seismic pain shot up from below. I jolted awake from a brief, merciful blackout.

Faintly, the voices came again—the World-Mind and Rhys.

“How much longer until your deal with the Swarm is complete?”

Rhys’s voice was utterly devoid of emotion.

“Who knows. I promised the Swarm that Rowan would incubate a thousand eggs for them. We are nowhere near done.”

The World-Mind hesitated, a sound of genuine pity cutting through the link.

“But your wife is fading fast. She’s been in continuous labor for nearly three days, enduring birth trauma every ten minutes. We must extract her. We need to find another way.”

“No!”

Rhys’s refusal was immediate, final. “A third of the task is complete. We will not abandon the path now.”

A bitter, chilling agony spread through my chest, eclipsing the physical pain. I closed my eyes in self-mockery.

Five years into the Xylosian invasion of the Stellar Union, I had developed the Bio-Interference Serum, the first effective counter to the Swarm’s communication system.

I’d risked my life going out to find more Xylosian samples for precision testing. The Stellar Government had assigned a full protection detail, but Rhys had stepped in, insisting he protect me himself.

I thought it was love—a husband’s deep-seated devotion. It was only days ago I realized the truth: a cold-blooded manipulation designed to modify the timeline and seal his bargain.

Freshly hatched Xylosian young, no bigger than my thumb, crawled onto my chest. Their needle-like mouthparts pierced my skin, drawing out a foul, nutrient-rich fluid. A fierce jolt of agony made my entire body seize, followed by another sickening tear below.

I couldn’t hold back the scream, the tears blurring my vision until my face was slick with them.

I couldn’t accept that Rhys could do this to me.

We were high school sweethearts, inseparable. He, the rising star of the Stellar Fleet, claimed he was sick of the cold, dynastic politics of the elite families and only wanted a simple, happy life with me. I had defied my own family’s expectations and married him.

When the Swarm attacked, I worked relentlessly, driven by the desire to be a partner worthy of standing beside him. I risked parasitism every day, immersed in my research. I finally cracked the code—the Serum—three months into my own pregnancy.

Now, I was a disgusting, broken vessel, a mother bug, endlessly spawning alien larvae. My own child, the one Rhys and I had made, was nothing but a casualty, a forgotten source of nutrition.

Suddenly, the World-Mind’s voice was frantic in the comm-link.

“Rhys, the Hive Lord is approaching! Rowan can withstand the drones, but if the Hive Lord violates her, she will die!”

Silence. Rhys was silent.

I waited, a sliver of desperate hope flickering. Maybe the years of marriage, the shared history, would finally break through. Maybe he would save me.

His cold, flat voice crushed that hope to dust.

“She can take it.”

The World-Mind sounded genuinely horrified.

“Rhys, she is your wife! Even to save the world, how can you let her endure this?”

“Since she is my wife, it is her duty to shoulder my burdens,” he snapped.

His voice rose, edged with a frantic, volatile energy.

“In the last timeline, the Swarm won. We all died. It was Willow, her sacrifice, that bought us this reboot. I signed a co-life contract with her—if she dies, I die. I will not let her come to harm this time. As for Rowan, once she has birthed the eggs, I will compensate her.”

It wasn’t just me he was sacrificing. He was doing it for her.

He had always claimed Willow Sinclair sacrificed her life to grant him this do-over. The co-life contract, he said, bound them in life and death. That explained the endless indulgence.

Willow wanted to be in the Research Corps, so he pulled strings to make her my assistant. She wanted to travel with the fleet, and he defied the government to keep her close. I fought him on it countless times.

Each time, he would pull me into his arms, his voice steady and earnest: “Ro, you are my wife, the only woman I truly love. Willow is just… a sister. She has no one. I’m just looking out for her.”

But I never imagined he would sacrifice my life to protect hers.

I watched the massive, grotesque body of the Hive Lord slither slowly toward me. I closed my eyes, resigning myself to oblivion.

I woke up in a medical bay, surrounded by ruin.

Rhys was there, kneeling beside the gurney. His eyes were red, his expression a mask of profound grief.

“Ro, I’m so sorry. I failed to protect you.”

I looked at that face, the one I had been so madly in love with, and felt a scorching hatred that made my bones ache. I wanted to see him reduced to dust.

I masked the venom in my eyes, letting a few weak tears slip down my cheeks. My voice was barely a whisper.

“Rhys… why did it take you so long to come for me?”

The hand stroking my hair flinched, and his eyes darted away, thick with guilt.

“The fleet was cut off by the Swarm. We fought for a week straight before we could breach the perimeter and find you.”

“I will protect you from now on, Ro. I promise. No matter what state you are in, I will always love you.”

He covered my naked, broken body with his own uniform and carried me back to the base.

The medics gasped when they saw my body—the raw, destroyed tissue on my chest, the horrific trauma below. What terrified them more were the hundreds of unhatched eggs still lodged deep in my uterus and lower intestine.

They feared infection and mutation. No one moved to touch me.

Rhys’s face darkened. He snarled, “What are you waiting for? Save her! If she dies, I’ll take this entire base down with her.”

The staff exchanged silent, panicked looks. They remained frozen.

Then, a tall figure in a clean white coat stepped forward, calmly taking charge of my wounds.

Rhys remained by my side, murmuring soft reassurances.

“Just a little longer, Ro. Don’t be afraid. I’m right here.”

A cold, metallic device entered my body, meticulously extracting the remaining eggs. The fresh trauma to my wounds was too much. I blacked out again.

When I next awoke, Rhys was holding my hand, his face etched with sorrow.

“Ro, trust me. I will exterminate the Swarm one day. I will avenge you.”

I closed my eyes, unable to look at his fake sincerity any longer. My love, my hope, my respect for him—it was all gone.

Now, only profound disappointment and hate remained.

Rhys was about to speak again, but a sickeningly sweet voice interrupted him.

“Rhys, darling, I heard you were back.”

Willow Sinclair walked in, looking like a celebrity arriving at a gala. Her fluffy skirt, lace, and ribbons made her look utterly ridiculous and completely out of place in a war-torn medical bay. While I had been covered in filth, working myself sick in a lab coat, Rhys had kept her blooming like an exotic flower.

The moment she saw me, Willow let out a theatrical shriek and recoiled, burying her face in Rhys’s chest in manufactured terror.

“Ah! A ghoul!”

Rhys smiled indulgently, stroking her hair. “It’s okay, Willow. It’s just Ro.”

Willow stared at me, her eyes wide with feigned shock, then turned a tearful, wounded expression to Rhys.

“Rhys, I… I didn’t know it was Ro. She looks so terrifying. I didn’t mean it.”

Rhys just hushed her, his comfort focused entirely on Willow.

I managed a cold, internal sneer. She insulted me, but she gets the sympathy.

Rhys used to accuse me of being jealous, paranoid, claiming he and Willow were innocent. I had clung to the belief that his love for me was real. Reality had just punched me in the face—repeatedly.

Rhys left, citing urgent fleet business, but left Willow to ‘look after me.’

She stepped closer, her expression shifting to one of undisguised revulsion.

“Disgusting. Ro, just look at you. Aren’t you sickened by yourself?”

“I heard the doctors pulled hundreds of eggs out of you. Rhys is putting on a brave face, but he must be utterly repulsed. If I were you, I’d take my own life. I wouldn’t have the face to live.”

I chuckled, a hollow sound.

“You don’t need to worry about my husband and me.”

We were legally married, protected by the Stellar Union’s laws. As long as that piece of paper existed, Willow was nothing more than an ugly footnote.

Willow’s face contorted into something genuinely ugly. She lunged, pinching the raw, exposed flesh on my chest wound.

“You filthy slut, violated by the Swarm! Why do you still cling to his side?”

“As Rhys’s true intended, I have to clean up his messes and dispose of you.”

She pulled out two injectors. A cold dread, colder than the metal on my body, seized me.

“What are you doing?” I rasped.

“You’re riddled with eggs. You must be parasitized.”

“One of these is the Xeno-Inhibitor. The other is a Xylosian Pheromone Accelerant. I was torn, but Rhys said you’ve produced so many already, why not just let you transform into the disgusting, low creature you are?”

I stared at Willow, horrified. I couldn't believe it.

I had led a team to develop the Inhibitor—the one thing that could save countless citizens from mutation. My life’s work, about to shock the entire Stellar Union.

Rhys had given my crowning achievement to Willow. And now he intended to turn me into a monster.

I was already compromised. The Inhibitor was my only hope. The Accelerant would seal my fate. Rhys was sacrificing me, then turning me into a monster, all for Willow.

“Willow Sinclair, you wouldn’t dare!”

My eyes bulged. I struggled to sit up, but the movement ripped open my wounds, sending a searing shockwave through me.

“Don’t fight, Ro.”

“I’ll take your place by Rhys’s side, adored by the public. You, my dear, can rot in hell.”

She slammed one of the injectors into my arm.

The Pheromone was a corrosive fire. My cells began to tear and boil. I screamed as the world dissolved into blackness.

When I next awoke, my mind was foggy, my body numb with a constant, deep ache.

I demanded to see Rhys. The nurses told me he and his fleet had already left for the Capitol Station.

A suffocating dread settled over me. Without the Inhibitor, I would mutate into a monster.

Begging and pleading, I managed to convince a small rescue team to pursue the fleet. We were lucky—a solar flare anomaly had delayed their take-off.

The fear of turning into one of them fueled a desperate, agonizing crawl. I fell at Rhys’s feet, begging him for one dose of the Inhibitor.

He looked down at me, his face hard and cold.

“Ro, stop this theatrics. This batch of Inhibitor is critical. It must be delivered to Capitol for mass production. I cannot afford to waste a single dose.”

I was stunned. I couldn’t believe he refused.

Even the accompanying medical staff were appalled. “Commander, Ms. Maxwell will mutate without the Inhibitor! She’s your wife. How can you treat her like this?”

Rhys shot me a look so venomous, it made me shiver.

“Rowan, you’ll stoop to hiring actors now?”

“Willow already gave you the Inhibitor. You are trying to frame her. I have a mission. I don’t have time for your childish, jealous games.”

He turned, not even looking back, and strode toward his ship, ordering an immediate launch.

The vessel was already spooling up its engines.

I grabbed his pant leg, humiliating myself with a final, broken plea.

“Rhys, I genuinely need one dose! Just one. Give it to me, and I’ll agree to the divorce. You can have Willow. You can have everything.”

My offer only seemed to enrage him. His face darkened. He roughly shook my hand off.

“Rowan Maxwell, you wouldn’t dare.”

“You will stay here at the base and reflect. I’ll come back for you when you’ve recovered.”

He stepped into the ship, reaching for Willow Sinclair, who was waiting at the hatchway, watching us.

Willow gave me a sweet, victorious smile. My heart sank, plummeting into a bottomless void.

I collapsed onto the tarmac, laughing—a choked, hysterical sound.

The laughter seized up, and a horrific surge of blood and raw tissue churned up my throat. I vomited a mouthful of viscera onto the metal deck.

The accompanying medics screamed, “She’s transforming! Get back!”

A few nurses wanted to help, but the fear of parasitism kept them rooted to the spot, their faces masks of anguish.

I would not become a monster. I asked the medic for a blade.

I handed them a data file and a video log.

“When I am gone, please give this to Rhys Kincaid.”

As I plunged the blade into my own heart, a sterile voice echoed in Rhys Kincaid’s mind:

“Co-Life Contract Partner Deceased. Commencing Life Countdown.”
