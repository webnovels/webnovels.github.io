The next day, I went to the hospital for my check-up as planned.

Scarlett stayed by my side, acting like a caring wife, but I could sense her inner anxiety.

Whenever the doctor asked about my donation frequency, she would quickly jump in to answer, afraid I might say something incriminating.

"Mr. Leo's donation frequency is indeed quite high," the examining doctor stated seriously.

"We recommend reducing the frequency of donations for now, to allow your body to fully rest."

"How long do I need to rest?" Scarlett asked eagerly.

"At least three months," the doctor replied.

I saw Scarlett's face instantly turn pale. She forced a smile.

"Okay, we'll follow the doctor's orders."

After leaving the consultation room, Scarlett remained distracted.

I deliberately said, "Looks like I really can't donate blood for a while. Those patients waiting for help will have to find other solutions."

"Yeah, it's a pity," she replied perfunctorily, her eyes darting around.

Back home, I excused myself, claiming to be unwell, and went to rest early.

In reality, I wanted to observe Scarlett's reaction.

Sure enough, once she thought I was asleep, she started making phone calls in the living room.

I quietly crept to the door and eavesdropped.

"Mr. Henderson, things are a bit complicated… Yes, the blood supply is temporarily cut off… What? You need the shipment next week? This…"

Scarlett's voice was clearly anxious.

"It's not that I'm not trying, it's just that he developed a health issue. The doctor advised him to stop donating blood for three months…"

"I know the consequences of breaching the contract, but there's really nothing I can do right now…"

Hearing this, my judgment was completely confirmed.

Scarlett was indeed involved in some kind of blood trade using my blood, and a stable business chain had already been established.

After she hung up, I heard Scarlett pacing in the living room, occasionally letting out anxious sighs.

A while later, another call came in.

"Jax? We have a problem… Yes, he can't donate blood anymore… Do you have any ideas?"

This call lasted a long time. I couldn't make out the specific content, but I could feel Scarlett's emotions growing increasingly agitated.

The next morning, Scarlett seemed preoccupied.

She hesitated several times, then finally spoke.

"Leo, I thought about it all night, and I think that doctor might be a bit overly cautious."

"Look, you're in such good spirits now. Do you really need to stop donating blood for three months?"

I pretended to consider it: "But the doctor said…"

"Doctors aren't infallible. Sometimes they give overly conservative advice to avoid liability," Scarlett interrupted me. "And right now, there really are a lot of patients waiting in the hospital. Their lives are hanging by a thread."

"Which patients?" I asked.

Scarlett paused, then quickly said, "There's an eight-year-old boy with leukemia who urgently needs Rh-negative blood for treatment."

"And a pregnant woman who had a massive hemorrhage after childbirth. Her situation is critical."

She spoke with such passion, if I didn't know the truth, I would have been moved.

But now, I just felt sick to my stomach.

"In that case, I'll go donate one more time," I pretended to be persuaded.

Scarlett's eyes instantly lit up: "Really? You're really willing?"

"Of course, it's a matter of life and death. How could I just stand by?" I said.

She hugged me excitedly: "I knew you were the kindest person. Those patients are saved."

I was in her arms, but my heart felt ice cold.
