I died.

The soup of forgetfulness was a bit bland.

"No green onions, it doesn't taste good, Grandma Meng."

I looked up at the Goddess of Forgetfulness, forcing a pale smile.

"Grandma, have you seen my Grandma Rose? She should be just ahead of me, about half an hour."

"You could... learn from her..."

Two streams of bloody tears flowed down my cheeks as I smiled mournfully, my heart breaking.

"The soup she makes is the best-tasting in the world."

"She's also the only person in the world who truly cares for me."

"It's my fault I couldn't save her, but why, Grandma? I was just one step away, just one step..."

Grandma Meng's pitch-black eyes stared at me silently.

Then she stroked my head. Though her touch was icy, I felt a warmth flow into me.

"Child, you did your best."

A white light flashed before my eyes, and when I opened them again, I had returned to the mortal world.

I became an earth-bound spirit, confined within a five-meter radius of Ethan.
