The first day after death.

I floated in the air, watching Ethan work with nothing better to do.

Ethan was still handsome, his suit jacket draped over the chair back, white shirt sleeves rolled up to reveal half of his muscular forearms.

The cufflinks were ones I had picked out.

But what use was it?

No matter how well I served him, I was still just a substitute for my sister.

After all, just look - what kind of life did my sister have, and what kind of life did I have?

To Ethan, my sister was his only childhood sweetheart, the delicate princess he had protected as they grew up.

How could he bear to let her do these trivial, housekeeper-like chores?

He had no qualms about ordering me around, this debt collector that my parents didn't love.

But Ethan seemed to be waiting for some news today.

He kept not receiving it.

He frequently picked up his phone, unlocked it, checked it, then angrily tossed it aside.

Especially as it got close to the end of the workday, his face was so dark it could almost drip ink.

How strange.

But to be fair, without me reminding him every day to eat on time, pay attention to the weather, share trivial matters.

He really didn't have many messages.

I guess I used to be such a chatterbox.

No wonder he found me annoying.
