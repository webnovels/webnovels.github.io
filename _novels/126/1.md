The day before I died, Ethan broke up with me.

Because he was going to get engaged to my sister.

I gathered my courage and asked him, "Ethan, can you not marry her?"

Ethan's dark eyebrows furrowed, his expression very displeased, his large hand gripping my waist tightly.

"Olivia, if you need money just say so. This act is nauseating."

"Don't forget why you exist."

"You like money that much? You like stealing from others? How cheap can you be?"

My expression became dejected.

I hadn't forgotten.

My existence was because my sister Sophia had a heart condition and couldn't do strenuous activities.

But my parents didn't want to miss this opportunity to climb the social ladder through Ethan.

So they made me, the "debt collector," replace my sister in "serving" Ethan.

Yes, that's right, serve.

A completely unequal term.

But when there's such a huge disparity in wealth and power, when even my birth parents don't treat me as a person, concepts like human rights and women's rights all become meaningless.

"Your sister will recover and be discharged from the hospital soon. She can get engaged and married."

"You fake, get lost quickly. Don't dream of stealing your sister's golden goose."

"Look at your sister's fate, and look at yours. How dare you even think you deserve this?"

My mother's cursing voice echoed in my ears.

My heart ached dully. I gave a faint smile and hugged Ethan's neck tightly.

"Mm, I am a bit short on money. Give me another 500,000 then."

The dim light hid the tears in my eyes.

No one believed that I, the substitute, truly loved Ethan.

"Watching you get engaged, I want to turn over a new leaf too."

"Consider this money as a dowry for my years of companionship."
