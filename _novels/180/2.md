After leaving the company, I didn't go straight home. Instead, I walked into a quiet café. Asher was already there, absentmindedly stirring his coffee.

"Hello, Mr. Zhou," I greeted softly. "I've resigned from Declan Corporation and can join your company anytime."

Hearing my voice, Asher stopped what he was doing, looked up, and gave a gentle smile. "Welcome, Miss Adeline. But no rush about work.

I understand you had a special relationship with Declan. Now that he's getting married, you might need some time to adjust. I'll give you three days to sort out personal matters.

Can you start after that?"

I frowned slightly. Although I knew my situation with Declan couldn't remain entirely secret, I didn't expect everyone in their circle to know.

Asher was the one who reached out to me after I left Declan Corporation, offering very favorable terms. Honestly, I couldn't believe it at first

After all, at Declan Corporation, I was just a secretary with an ambiguous status—not worth such treatment.

"Mr. Zhou, may I ask why you're offering me such generous terms?" I couldn't help but ask.

Asher remained calm, took a sip of coffee, and gave me an answer that made me half-believe.

"I understand Declan. If Miss Adeline can be his secretary for five years, then being a department manager in our company is more than enough.

Also, I hope Miss Adeline won’t have any ‘unexpected’ entanglements with our partners after joining."

After some thought, I finally accepted Asher’s offer. After all, the benefits were tempting, and I needed the money now. Just as I nodded in agreement, a familiar cold laugh came from behind.

Declan walked into the café, holding Phoebe’s hand. I knew him too well. Whenever he laughed like that, it meant he was angry—really angry.

"Mr. Zhou, long time no see. Even the people my company doesn’t want, the Zhou Corporation is willing to take?"

"But let me remind Mr. Zhou, this person isn’t honest and loves money. Be cautious as an employee."

I listened quietly to every word Declan said about me. My fingers clenched under the table, almost piercing into my skin.

In fact, the moment Declan fired me, I didn’t hate him. After all, what we had was just a five-year transaction. He gave me money, and I accompanied him in bed.

But I didn’t understand why, even after leaving Declan Corporation, he still had to be so aggressive.

I bit my lip hard, holding back the sting in my nose, trying not to let tears fall. "Mr. Declan, if I really stole from Declan Corporation, you can call the police. But don’t slander me!"

Declan glanced at me coldly, saying nothing more.

But Phoebe laughed and stepped forward. "Miss Adeline, it’s just a joke. Why so serious?

Are you saying today’s compensation isn’t enough and you want more?"

Saying this, she pulled out a wad of cash from her bag and threw it at me. "I heard your mom is still in the hospital waiting for money to save her life, right? But don’t throw away your dignity. This money is a reward for you!"
