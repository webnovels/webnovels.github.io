As Phoebe finished her words, the wad of cash hit my face harshly.

One of the corners cut my right cheek, leaving a shallow scratch. The surrounding gazes focused on me—some sympathetic, some mocking, and some undisguised malice.

"She’s now an employee of Zhou Corporation and has nothing to do with Declan Corporation," Asher said coldly, suddenly looking at Phoebe. Phoebe instinctively stepped back, hiding behind Declan. It was the first time I saw Declan so tense about someone.

He immediately protected Phoebe, facing Asher.

Finally, he glanced at me nonchalantly, saying, "Isn’t it just a scratch on the face?

Consider this compensation, she still profits." With that, Declan squinted at me. I knew he was warning me to stop while I was ahead.

If I didn’t accept it, he had ways to make things worse for me.

The five years of feelings never left any mark in his heart. He never had any true feelings for me. I forced a smile, humiliated, and picked up the money from the ground piece by piece. "Don’t worry, Mr. Declan, I profited."

Each word was squeezed out through clenched teeth; my gums were bleeding. Phoebe sneered, "Really like a lapdog!" I clenched my teeth, the soft flesh inside my mouth nearly bitten through, the metallic taste of blood spreading on my tongue.

I didn’t dare look up, knowing how pathetic and ridiculous I must seem.

In the end, Asher sighed, took my hand, and led me out of the café. "Take a good rest for three days. I’ll be waiting for you at Zhou Corporation."

Back at the apartment, Declan’s jacket was still on the messy bed. I began tidying up, collecting all his things, and putting them in a box.

I planned to return them to him or just throw them away. After a few hours, I realized the whole apartment was filled with traces of him over the past five years.

The toothbrush and towel in the bathroom, the plants on the windowsill, the apron in the kitchen...

Unknowingly, I had treated him as a real boyfriend over these five years, not just a part of a transaction. Although I didn’t want to admit it, this was the reality.

The lock clicked, and the familiar figure appeared before me, as always.

Declan immediately noticed the things I packed for him, coldly mocking, "Found a new backer, and now you can’t wait to kick your old patron out?"

"Adeline, are you that cheap? Can’t live without money?" I bit my lip hard, the deep imprint clearly visible. So, in Declan’s heart, I was just that kind of despicable person. But none of this mattered anymore.

Although I don't want to admit it, this is the reality.

The door lock suddenly clicked, and a familiar figure appeared before me, just like always.

Declan glanced at the things I had packed for him and scoffed, "Found a new patron already? Can't wait to kick your old benefactor out, huh?"

"Adeline, are you really so desperate? Can't live without money?"

I bit my lower lip hard, leaving deep, visible teeth marks.

So, in Declan's mind, I'm just this despicable person.

But none of this matters anymore.

A heart that's already dead can't be brought back to life.

"We agreed on five years from the start. Now that the time is up and you're getting married, I won't hold you back."

"Besides, I've already resigned from Declan Corporation. Mr. Declan, you have no reason to stay with me anymore, right?"

He said nothing, his face frighteningly grim as he sat on the sofa, his fingers lightly tapping the armrest.

I quickly pushed the packed things in front of him.

"I've packed everything. You can take it when you leave."

As soon as I finished speaking, Declan's expression darkened even more.

I had no idea what had upset him.

Just like a reflex from the past five years, I quickly ran through all the possible reasons he might be mad.

Finally, I remembered something and said to him, "I'll also give up this apartment, don't worry. As for the past five years, I won't say a word, nor will I spread gossip in front of Miss White, and I won't bother you again."

Declan paused, his expression unreadable in the dim light.

Soon, he sneered, leaned over, and pinched my chin.

In no time, a red mark appeared on my chin.

"It's best if you're this sensible, or you'll regret it!"

"I don't want these things. You've touched them, and I find them dirty!"

With that, Declan turned and walked out.

His words took my breath away, and I couldn't hold back the tears in my eyes, which fell one by one.

I closed my eyes, letting the tears fall.

And he never looked back.
