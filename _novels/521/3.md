Youthful passion was no match for family pressure.

His family wouldn't let him marry a girl with no background. While he was fighting his family for me, I showed up pregnant.

His family relented, but the way he looked at me was full of unfamiliarity.

Deep down, he thought I was just a woman who would do anything to marry up.

From that day until our child was born, I never saw him again.

After that, he started bringing all sorts of women home.

He was always intimate with those women in front of me, then come back to my side and say he loved me.

At first the servants sympathized with me, then they started advising me.

"The boss does care about you. Don't be angry with him."

"If he didn't love you, would he sleep with you every night?"

"He just doesn't know how to express love. You need to understand and forgive him."

But who would understand and forgive me?

Amidst the turmoil, I took out divorce papers and shoved a pen into his hand.

"Lucas Shaw, I've found a house I like. My brother is getting married soon..."

He sneered, "So you're showing your true colors now?"

"Next time don't use our daughter as an excuse. Just tell me directly what you want."

"So you won't end up greedy like your mother."

I nodded mutely, a bitter taste in my mouth.

Yes, my family wasn't well-off. I grew up in a small town where they favored boys. But after we married, I never let my family take advantage of him.

But he didn't believe me.

When it was over, I quickly wrapped myself up and returned to our room.

Now I just had to wait for the cooling-off period to end, and I could take our daughter and leave this place for good.

But our daughter, who should have been lying quietly in bed, was gone.

I panicked, frantically searching everywhere.

She was so small, still unsteady on her feet. Where could she have gone?

Lucas answered his phone. "Alright, I understand. Thank you for your trouble."

He looked weary. "Claire took Mia out. She said the child was crying for her mother and looked pitiful, so she took her out to play for a bit."

My vision went black.

"She hates me to the bone. How could she truly care for my daughter?"

"Tell me where they are quickly. I need to go save my daughter."

He stepped back, disappointment filling his eyes.

"Mia is my daughter too. Do you think I would hurt her?"

"Claire has a kind heart and studied early childhood education. She'll take good care of Mia, so don't make trouble."

How could I possibly believe him? Just yesterday, Claire had sent me many intimate photos of them.

She had said: "You only became Mrs. Shaw because of that little brat."

"If she were gone, do you think you'd still keep your position as Mrs. Shaw?"

Tears poured from my eyes as I lunged for his phone.

"If you won't ask, I will."

He raised the phone out of reach and slapped me hard across the face.

I was stunned, my ears ringing.

"You can't take care of the child like this. Stay home and calm down," he said coldly.

Security guards covered my mouth and dragged me to the basement.

I struggled desperately, my fingers leaving bloody prints on the floor.

The door slammed shut, the last bit of light disappearing.

So this was where my little Mia had spent two hours. She must have been so scared.
