I pounded frantically on the door, crying out:

"Lucas Shaw, I give up! I was wrong, I shouldn't have clung to you."

"Please let me out. Mia will die in that woman's hands. I'm begging you."

Separated by the door, I could sense him standing outside.

"Olivia Sanders, I don't know how we ended up like this."

"If you're willing to admit you were wrong, I'll forgive you."

My pupils constricted as I pounded the door even harder.

"Lucas Shaw, you bastard! You monster! If anything happens to Mia, I'll hate you for the rest of my life."

He yanked the door open suddenly. I fell into his arms, caught off guard.

"I really don't know what to do with you. Is it so hard to just apologize?" he said, his tone exasperated as if dealing with a beloved partner.

I pushed him away, my eyes full of unfamiliarity.

"Lucas Shaw, I've told you many times Mia is in danger. Why do you never believe me?"

His expression instantly darkened.

"Danger, danger, danger. You've been paranoid ever since you had the child."

"I've assigned several bodyguards to Mia. What danger could she be in?"

"You're so suspicious now, how can I take you to meet business partners looking like this?"

Unable to see my daughter, I no longer cared about such things. I just wanted to find her.

I fell to my knees before him.

"I'm not worthy. I'm despicable. I promise I'll never appear before you again. Just tell me where they are."

"Please."

I kowtowed again and again, not stopping even as blood flowed.

Lucas's heart clenched painfully. He couldn't understand how his once pure and beautiful wife had become like this.

His voice was weary. "Fine, I'll show you."

I hurriedly grabbed his phone. It was a video sent by Claire.

In the video, Mia clutched a stuffed rabbit's ears. Her eyes were red as if she'd been crying, and there were red marks on her little hands. She pouted, as if trying not to cry at something she saw.

"I like playing with Auntie. Mommy doesn't need to worry."

Tears streamed uncontrollably down my face.

Mia was in danger!

I used to worry what I would do if she got lost, was kidnapped, or if Lucas's family wouldn't let me see her.

So I told her that if she was ever in danger, she should grab the rabbit's ears, and Mommy would appear by her side.

"Mia is in danger. I have to go save her."

Lucas looked at me with even more disappointment.

"Olivia Sanders, you need to go to the hospital."

No, I couldn't go to the hospital. If I went, who would save my daughter?

So I pushed past him and ran to the garage, getting in my car.

The display screen in the car was connected to the tracker in Mia's stuffed rabbit. It showed them moving towards the sea.

My suspicions were correct. Claire was going to kill my daughter.

I sped recklessly, running many red lights and causing several cars to crash.

Lucas gritted his teeth. "Olivia Sanders, do you know what you're doing?"

My gaze was determined, my tone resolute. "I know."

To stop me from making a bigger mistake, he crashed his car into mine at the intersection before I could intercept Claire.

I was trapped in the car, begging him to go save our child.

He took a deep breath, his face grim. "Olivia Sanders, you're suffering from paranoid delusions. You need to go to a mental hospital. Mia and I will wait for you to come back."

No matter how I pleaded, it was useless.

Lucas dialed the mental hospital. Looking at the calm sea, a wave of panic washed over him.

A call from the police made him utterly despair.

"Mr. Shaw? We've received reports that your daughter has drowned. Is this true?"
