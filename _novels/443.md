After learning that I voluntarily gave up my promotion opportunity to her beloved junior colleague, my wife, who had always been adamant about not having children, surprisingly agreed to have a baby with me.

When the junior colleague found out, he became insanely jealous and threatened to resign, even picking up a scalpel to harm himself.

My wife panicked and, to appease him, not only gave him my bonus but also moved out of our home to accompany him on a month-long world tour.

Afterwards, my wife acted completely indifferent.

"Lucas and I have been busy attending medical conferences. Unlike you, who's been sitting around doing nothing and jumping to malicious conclusions!"

"You're the one with the dirty mind. People with rotten hearts see everything as filthy!"

I clutched the pregnancy test report that her junior colleague had sent me earlier, feeling no anger, just a slight smile.

Seeing that I didn't argue, my wife looked satisfied and promised with a smile that she'd give me a big, chubby son later, fulfilling my wish to become a father.

But she didn't know that we had no future together.

Not long ago, she had unknowingly signed our divorce papers with her own hand.
