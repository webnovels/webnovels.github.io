My husband, Albert Thorne, was lauded as a philanthropic icon. He was constantly “mentoring” troubled young women through his foundation, often providing them with “transitional housing.”
At first, I managed to swallow my jealousy and play the supportive wife.
But gradually, he began bringing those girls home. They would occupy the guest wing, borrow my clothes—sometimes even my favorite pajamas—and one night, he woke me up at 2 AM, commanding me to go out and buy a forgotten item for the girl in the next room.
In that moment, I knew the careful, fragile scaffolding of our marriage was rotten to the core.
On our fifth wedding anniversary, I asked him for a divorce.
His response was a cold, condescending chuckle.
“You’re not a kid anymore, Penny,” he said, his voice dripping with superiority. “A thirty-year-old woman needs to be realistic. You won't find better than me. You won’t find another Albert Thorne.”
I wiped the tears from my eyes, slipped off the simple silver band that had once meant the world, and dropped it into the kitchen waste bin.
“You’re right,” I replied, my voice steadying. “I may not be young anymore, but I’m old enough to know when to cut my losses and exit a dead-end street.”

After tearing up the divorce papers, Albert Thorne spent the entire night chain-smoking in the great room.
He walked into our master suite early the next morning, attempting a placid air as he urged me to be reasonable.
“Sherry is only staying here for a few days, Penny. If you’re divorcing me because of her, you need to understand that’s completely irrational.”
Meeting his gaze—a look so devoid of warmth, so steeped in poisonous dismissal—my heart plummeted, chilling my entire body.
My mind raced, circling back to the countless snapshots of different girls on his phone. Lately, though, he seemed to have settled on a single obsession. The buzz around his company was deafening: he was infatuated with his ninety-ninth mentee, Sherry Greene.
He hadn't just given her an office. He’d customized a lavish private lounge in the executive suite, ordering an eight-foot, custom-made luxury bed from overseas, all to cater to her "delicate needs."
Everyone below the C-suite was placing bets on how long this seemingly naive, wide-eyed girl could keep Albert away from home. They were already calling her the future Mrs. Thorne.
Mid-discussion, Albert’s phone rang. He glanced at the screen, and the urgency in his posture was unmistakable. He grabbed his jacket and rushed toward the door.
Before leaving, he turned back to me.
“Penny, you need time to calm down. I’ve already contacted my private physician to set you up with a good therapist.”
A single, silent tear traced a path down my cheek.
I had lived with him in a scorching hot, rickety studio apartment built on the roof of a six-story building during his lean years—a summer so miserable it made me want to jump off the fire escape. I hadn’t been sick then.
Yet now, after he’d built his empire and amassed a fortune, I was suddenly the hysterical, spiraling madwoman in everyone’s eyes.
My phone vibrated twice on the nightstand, displaying a chain of incoming photos. A taunting message sat at the bottom.
“Penny, do you think Albert was just being nice? He says I look like a princess in this dress.”
In the frame, Sherry, draped in an extravagant white gown, was clinging to Albert’s neck, a look of smug triumph radiating from her face.
My fingertips dug into the back of my phone, turning white.
So, Albert had time for a wedding photo shoot despite his impossible schedule. He looked even more distinguished and handsome in a tuxedo than I had ever imagined.
We had been married for five years and never taken a single wedding picture.
In the beginning, it was truly about money.
Albert had made me a promise.
“Penny, the minute I land my first big paycheck, I’m going to make you the happiest bride in the world.”
“You love diamonds, right? You said they represent forever. One day, I will commission a diamond-encrusted gown just for you.”
“I’ll hold you to that,” I’d laughed, sweet and naive.
As his business grew, so did his late nights and absences. That cherished photo shoot became a hollow phantom memory.
I let out a harsh, self-deprecating laugh, and this time, the tears flowed unchecked.
Albert Thorne, you broke more than a few promises.

I waited until three in the morning, and the front door opened, just as I’d known it would.
Sherry was practically carrying a thoroughly inebriated Albert.
“Darling, hold on, please. We have company.”
I looked up, catching Albert wrapping Sherry in a deep, desperate kiss.
Seeing my icy expression, Sherry immediately pulled back and offered a shaky apology.
“Oh, Penny. I… I didn’t know you were here.”
Her words were so ridiculous, I almost laughed. My voice was a block of ice.
“I’m in my own home. Do I need to schedule an appointment with you?”
That one sentence was enough to make her eyes well up.
Albert instantly noticed her distress. He slowly and deliberately kissed her tears away, then turned to me, his anger immediate and protective.
“Look what you’ve done. You scared the girl to tears. You really are something else, Penny.”
I bit my lip, forcing back the burning in my own eyes.
“Albert, please… can you stop bringing other women into our home?”
He knew I had a debilitating need for cleanliness—especially in matters of the heart. I couldn't tolerate a speck of dust, or any kind of stain.
Yet, he constantly chose to wound me.
Sherry, moments ago pliant and limp in his arms, now looked like a startled deer. She glanced at me with timid eyes. “Penny, I know you hate me. I’ll leave right now.”
But she hadn’t taken a single step before Albert pulled her back, holding her tight.
“No! I forbid you to go anywhere.”
Meeting my gaze, Albert’s tone hardened with impatience.
“It’s pouring outside. Where exactly are you trying to send her?”
I clenched my fists, barely resisting the urge to walk over and slap them both.
“I don’t care where she goes. But one thing is clear: I forbid her from stepping foot into the master bedroom. She will not contaminate my bed.”
Feeling utterly shamed, Sherry wrenched herself free and ran out of the house.
“Are you always this aggressively petty?” Albert shot me a vicious glare, then hurried out after her.
The next day, filled with dread, I went to the hospital for my follow-up appointment. The doctor told me I was pregnant.
My immediate reaction was: “This child cannot stay.”
The doctor frowned, bewildered. “Ms. Davis, your husband has a low sperm count. You know better than anyone how difficult it was to conceive. Why the sudden change of heart?”
Against the doctor’s pleading advice, I clutched the ultrasound photo and was drawn, as if by an invisible string, to Albert’s office.
His executive assistant cautiously intercepted me, stammering that Mr. Thorne was meeting with a crucial client and couldn’t be disturbed.
The façade of professionalism shattered the next second, broken by Sherry’s high-pitched, triumphant laugh from inside the office.
“I know, it must be tiring standing guard for them for so long.”
I gave the assistant a wry, self-deprecating smile, crumpled the sonogram into a ball, and pushed the door open.
The sight that greeted me—a sordid, ugly spectacle—sent a sharp, agonizing shock through my heart.
Seeing me, both of them instantly scrambled into a panic.
Albert, however, quickly regained his composure, coolly adjusted his clothes, and instantly reverted to his usual impeccably dressed, innocent persona.
“I’ve had a bad back lately from all the overtime. Sherry was just giving me a massage. It’s not what you think.”
I didn’t want to hear his flimsy excuses. I threw the crumpled paper ball at him.
“I’m pregnant. When are you going to end things with her? I refuse to bring a child into the world while you’re entangled with this little harlot. It will be severely damaging to their psychological health.”
“What? You’re pregnant?”
Albert excitedly unfolded the paper. He rushed over and embraced me, his voice booming with sudden happiness.
“Penny, thank you! My parents have been waiting for a grandchild for years. You are a hero to the Thorne family!”
I knew Albert desperately wanted children, which was why, despite his low fertility, I had endured the painful monthly fertility shots.
Just as I started to believe he might finally settle down and return to our family, Sherry’s mocking voice rang out from behind me.
“So what? Just a pregnancy? Big deal.”

She pulled her own sonogram from her purse, giving Albert a playful, knowing wink as she handed it to him.
“I wanted to surprise you, but I guess my plans got ruined. So, I’ll announce it early! Darling, I’m younger than Penny. I have a much better chance of giving you a son. You’ll let me keep the baby, right?”
Albert was so overcome with joy, he looked like he’d forgotten his own name.
“Of course! You and Penny are the two women I love! Both of you pregnant at the same time—this is the greatest gift Heaven could give me!”
He instinctively pushed me away, bent down, and scooped up the shoeless Sherry.
“How many times do I have to tell you the floor is cold? You silly girl never remembers.”
Sherry hooked her arm around his neck and stared directly at me, a flash of brazen triumph in her eyes.
“Penny, my baby is almost three months along. If all goes well, I’ll give Albert a son before you do. Then your child won’t have to waste money on clothes—they can just wear my son’s hand-me-downs.”
I froze, my limbs rigid and useless. I was turning to stone right there.
Albert lovingly nudged her nose with his finger.
“Sherry, you are always so sweet.”
Lost in his delusion, Albert reached out to stroke Sherry’s belly, then turned back to me with a beaming smile.
“Now, you two can go through your pregnancies together, sharing tips and experiences. Thanks to me, you won't be lonely. You even have a pregnancy buddy!”
He was clearly thrilled with his own masterpiece, dismissing all the doctors who had diagnosed his infertility with a sneer. He immediately pulled out his phone and posted on social media. “To all the naysayers who said I couldn’t do it—you just got slapped in the face! Next spring, I’ll be the father of two. What can I say? I’m just a humble guy.”
Before I had even left the company parking lot, my phone was blowing up with congratulatory messages.
The extended family group chat was in chaos.
Some fawned over me, complimenting my capability: “The Thorne family’s eldest daughter-in-law, you are truly amazing! Twins in one go!”
Others pestered me for tips, hoping to have two children at once.
Ignoring everyone, I calmly typed out a message and sent it to the chat.
“I think there’s a misunderstanding. Albert has fertility issues; I only have one child in my womb, and it cost me thousands in hormone shots just to keep it. However, the mistress he keeps outside, who is much younger, managed to conceive his child in three months and has guaranteed a son. If you have any questions about fertility, please direct them to her. She is clearly more experienced.”
Albert’s parents, the senior Thornes, were honorable, old-school people who valued their family name above all else. They also knew I had been the steady anchor who had enabled Albert’s success.
They flew in from their retirement home, immediately ordering Albert to cut off all contact with Sherry.
Sherry was instantly terrified and burst into tears, clutching her stomach and crying out in pain.
Mrs. Thorne, a woman who recognized a performance when she saw one, spat a furious denouncement.
“You little tramp! Our family will never acknowledge a loose woman like you. Take your little bastard and get lost!”
Unable to tolerate the insult, Sherry dropped to her knees and begged me for mercy.
“Penny, I know you told them. But I don’t blame you. I was too foolish, thinking I could have Albert’s love like you do. I’m not worthy. I’ll go now.”
Wiping her tears, she stood up dramatically and marched out.
Albert, his eyes full of anguish, chased after her. He pulled her into his car and spent several minutes comforting her before returning, redirecting his entire reservoir of fury onto me.
“Penny, go outside, get on your knees, and apologize to Sherry!”

I met his eyes, unyielding.
“Albert Thorne, did you lose your brain in Sherry Greene’s uterus when you cheated? I am your wife. She is your mistress. Why should I apologize to her?”
He laughed, a cold, desperate sound, his eyes burning with malice. He spat his final threat: “Fine. Then don’t blame me for making you a living widow for the rest of your life!”
After that fight, Albert moved out, beginning his brazen, shameless cohabitation with Sherry.
Every single day after that, Sherry relentlessly rubbed Albert’s favor in my face.
A stream of photos flooded my phone—snapshots of them in front of their new lake house.
“When I’m upset, he goes against his own parents for me. He bought me this villa to keep me safe from everyone.”
“His entire photo library is just me, Penny. He has no room for any other woman.”
“The nursery is all set. He says he only loves the baby I’m carrying. He said the other one is just a dog we’re raising.”
My eyes burned, but no tears came.
I had cried enough tears for Albert in the eight years we’d been together.
From now on, I would never cry for him again.
That afternoon, I called a cab to the clinic and firmly scheduled the termination.
As my body rested on the cold steel of the operating table, a profound sadness washed over me.
“Ms. Davis, are you absolutely ready?” the nurse asked, triple-checking, worried I might regret it.
“Yes. Please hurry. Every second I remain in this suffocating marriage is a second too long.”
As the anesthetic entered my veins, I felt incredibly heavy and tired, drifting into a long, vivid dream.
I was seventeen again. Albert was waiting for me outside the dorm, sheepishly handing me a thermos of warm milk he’d been hiding in his jacket.
Then it was the first snow after college graduation. All the roads were blocked. Albert and I walked hand-in-hand to the courthouse. He bought a bundle of roadside roses from an elderly couple and swore an oath on his heart that he would only ever share his life with me.
Those times were difficult, but so sweet.
Within a few years, he went from having nothing to building a commercial empire, finally fulfilling his promise of a financially secure life.
And then, he cheated.
A sharp, intense pain jolted me back to reality.
I opened my eyes. It was over.
I asked the nurse for the tiny, underdeveloped embryo.
It had a chance at life, but Albert had destroyed it all.
“My baby, Mommy loves you. But Mommy needs to learn how to love herself first.”
As soon as I got home, Albert called.
“Sherry said your pearl necklace was beautiful, so I let her borrow it. Turns out the quality was trash; she accidentally yanked it too hard and it broke. She feels terrible and wants to apologize.”
“If you’re free, come over to the lake house. And while you’re at it, make a fruit cake and bring it with you. It’s Sherry’s birthday, and she loves your baking.”
Shocked, I rushed to the dresser. The necklace was gone. It was my mother’s last possession.
“Hello, Penny, are you listening to me?” Albert demanded, his voice impatient.
A white-hot rage flared up in me, overriding my usual meekness. I screamed into the phone: “Albert Thorne, you selfish bastard! Do you have any conscience left? That was my mother’s legacy! My last memory of her! How dare you just hand it over to Sherry?”
Even over the phone, I could feel his dark scowl, devoid of any hint of apology.
“Penny, who are you raising your voice at? It was a worthless string of cheap beads! I’ll transfer some money to your account later. Buy a new one.”
“Instead of throwing a tantrum, you should be in the kitchen baking the cake.”
I stumbled and fell, catching sight of the signed divorce papers lying on the floor.
“Fine,” I said, steadying my voice. “I’ll make the cake. But you have to agree to one thing.”

Albert was silent for a few seconds, then sighed wearily. “Just spit it out. How long do I have to spend dragging myself to your high school alma mater this time?”
My heart sank. I wanted to correct his arrogant assumption, but Sherry’s sugary voice cut in first.
“If Penny doesn’t want to do it, it’s fine. I don’t have to eat it.”
Her feigned virtue was sickening.
The next moment, Albert readily agreed to my request.
“Fine, I’ll go with you. But this is the last time. Penny, honestly, you’re becoming so childish.”
When I arrived, Sherry was already waiting outside, eager to show off her new mansion.
“Oh, Penny, I’m so sorry you had to bring it yourself. It’s all Albert’s fault. He keeps saying yours tastes better than any caterer’s.”
I gave her a flat stare and tossed the cake in her direction.
“Then savor it. Because you won’t get another chance.”
A smirk flashed in Sherry’s eyes. “Penny, you’re joking. All I have to do is say the word, and Albert will order you to bake me another one. He makes you look worse than a maid, honestly.”
Albert heard the commotion and walked out, immediately rushing me along. “The cake’s here. You can go now.”
I calmly pulled out the divorce papers.
“Sign this, and I’ll disappear instantly. You won’t have to chase me away.”
Albert’s mouth twisted into a cynical smirk. “So it was always about money and power, wasn’t it? I finally see your true colors, Penny. You’re a materialistic woman.”
Assuming the documents contained a request for company stock, he signed his name without so much as a glance at the contents.
The heavy weight on my chest finally lifted.
As I turned to leave, I held out my hand to Sherry. “My pearl necklace. Hand it over.”
A flicker of malicious cunning crossed her face. She leaned in close, whispering conspiratorially. “You should have been quicker. I flushed that trash down the toilet ten minutes ago.”
Shaking with cold fury, I raised my purse strap and swung it at her head.
She screamed, outraged, spitting insults. “Bitch! Old hag! You actually hit me! Albert won’t forgive you for this!”
I ignored her completely. She wasn’t worth my attention. But I wouldn’t let her get away with it. I raised my hand and delivered a sharp, echoing slap across her cheek.
“That one is for being a home-wrecker and destroying a family the minute you walked out of college!”
I slapped her again. “And that one is for theft—for destroying something irreplaceable. You deserve that!”
“And this one—”
