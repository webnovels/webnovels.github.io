Today is our wedding anniversary. 
I bought some sexy lingerie, planning to surprise my husband.
Just as we were kissing passionately, urgent knocking came from the door.
My husband got out of bed to check.
But his phone, left on the bed, lit up. 
I picked it up to look, and my hand flew to my mouth in shock.
My best friend was sending my husband nude photos!
[Babe! Open the door quick! I'll give your wife her sleeping milk again tonight]
[Once she's asleep, I'll strip completely and show you my new lingerie]
[I put even more sleeping pills in this time. She didn't notice on your wedding night, and she won't escape this time either!]
My hands were shaking as I put the phone back. 
My husband walked in carrying a glass of milk.
"That knocking was Lauren. She saw you haven't been sleeping well lately, so she specially brought you some warm milk."

I stared at the milk in his hands, my mind still reeling from shock.
Ethan's face showed what seemed like genuine concern.
Remembering the messages I just saw, I immediately shook my head.
"I don't want it."
Ethan frowned, about to try persuading me again.
My best friend Lauren suddenly appeared at the bedroom door. 
Startled, I quickly put my clothes back on.
But she walked in naturally, like the lady of the house, taking the milk from my husband's hands.
"I'm not interrupting, am I?"
Lauren sat down on my bed.
"Raina, stop throwing a tantrum. Only Ethan has the patience to put up with you."
"He's just worried about you. Come on, drink it."
Before I could speak, she shoved the cup right up to my lips.
Seeing the smirk suddenly curl at the corner of her mouth, I instinctively raised my hand and knocked it away.
Her hand slipped, and the cup crashed to the floor, shattering into pieces.
My leg was cut by the broken glass, blood immediately streaming down.
Lauren let out a frightened cry.
"Raina! Lauren was trying to help. Why are you taking it out on her?"
Ethan urgently scooped up Lauren in his arms, placing her on our bed. His large hands gripped her leg, then spread it apart.
Lauren's face instantly flushed red, her resistance half-hearted.
"I'm fine—"
Ethan held her leg firmly, running his hand upward, his voice gentle.
"Don't move. Let me check if you're hurt."
Seeing a small scratch on Lauren's leg, his eyes filled with heartache. He completely ignored me.
I stared at him blankly, opening my mouth without thinking.
"Ethan, I'm hurt too—"
Without even looking at me, he coldly cut me off.
"Enough. I'm just making up for your mistake. Is there any point in being jealous right now?"
Lauren bit her lip, her face full of guilt.
"Raina, this is my fault. Did I disturb you two today? Is that why you're angry with me?"
"Please don't fight because of me. I'll leave right now, okay?"
As she tried to stand, Ethan pressed her back down.
His gaze shifted to me, quietly watching.
I thought he'd finally noticed I was badly hurt, that he'd ask if I was in pain.
Reality hit me like a slap in the face.
"Lauren came all this way to bring you milk. Instead of being grateful, you hurt her. How can you be so vicious?"
His face showed complete impatience, a far cry from the gentle tone he'd just used to comfort Lauren.
My heart felt like it was being pricked with needles, dense pain spreading through it.
Today was supposed to be our wedding anniversary. What was Lauren doing here?
Especially now—Ethan's eyes were practically glued to Lauren.
I even felt confused for a moment, like I was actually the outsider here.
I suddenly remembered how whenever something happened to Lauren in the past, he'd always rush to her side first.
On a stormy day when Lauren's car broke down, he kicked me out of the car to go pick her up.
When he traveled abroad, I asked him to bring back a souvenir. He found it too troublesome. But when Lauren casually mentioned she liked something, he'd run halfway across the city to buy it for her.
And me? As his wife, if I showed even the slightest unhappiness about this, I'd be accused of being unreasonable.
Every time, I told myself he was only good to Lauren because she was my best friend, that he actually loved me.
This time, I couldn't lie to myself anymore.
My whole body trembled. I couldn't say a word.
Ethan scooped up Lauren and walked past me.
"I'm taking Lauren home. You should reflect on yourself."
Watching their retreating figures, my nails dug into my palms.
That night, I came across a post on Lauren's social media.
"He's so intense, I can't take it anymore."
She'd attached a photo from inside a car. The reflective glass showed two figures entwined.
I'd recognize that man's profile anywhere, even if he turned to ash.
I'd just taken a screenshot as evidence when the post was deleted.
Just then, Ethan called, his voice hoarse.
"Something came up at the company. I won't be home tonight."
