"Dmitry, if you want to divorce Dalena, you’ll have to return all the assets and shares and leave with nothing."
"Fine."
"And you’ll need to give up custody of the child and never see her or the child again. Can you accept that?"
"I accept."
Dmitry's tone was firm and indifferent. "Madam, the contract has already expired. Dalena and the child are now taken care of. It’s time for me to go."
Dalena's mother was silent on the other end of the call for a long time before she let out a heavy sigh. "If you insist on leaving, I’ll honor the agreement and send you to Vienna for advanced music studies. The arrangements will take a week."
"As for the divorce, you’ll have to discuss that with Dalena yourself."
"Thank you, Madam."
After hanging up, Dmitry silently took out a photograph.
In the photo, Dalena’s face was glowing, her smile radiating happiness. Their son, Cyril, was holding a toy, cheerfully waving his hands.
Ironically, the man in the photo wasn’t Dmitry but Dalena’s childhood sweetheart, Fabio.
Fabio and Dalena both came from noble families. They had been inseparable since childhood and even became each other’s first love.
However, at the age of 20, Fabio went abroad for an arranged marriage with another woman. When Dalena found out, she was devastated, crying every day and losing herself completely.
To help her daughter recover, Dalena's mother found Dmitry, who was in desperate need of money. For just five million, she bought ten years of his life to help Dalena get back on track.
From that day on, Dalena suddenly had an ardent suitor.
Not only was he handsome, but he was also a graduate of New York University's art department, brimming with talent and charm.
Whenever Dalena was feeling low, Dmitry would play songs for her anytime, anywhere.
Whenever Dalena fell ill, he would stay by her side day and night, taking meticulous care of her.
Over time, she grew used to having a "male nanny" by her side, but she never agreed to marry him.
That changed after a drinking contest during a social event. A wealthy heir had wagered an international project on who could drink the most.
To solve Dalena’s financial problems, Dmitry drank until he suffered a stomach hemorrhage and was rushed to the hospital unconscious.
For the first time, Dalena cried for him.
"Dmitry, I’ve decided to marry you. I believe we’ll make it work..."
Later, Dmitry learned that the day she agreed to marry him was also the day of Fabio’s wedding. The whole social circle was abuzz with photos of Fabio kissing his bride.
Despite knowing the truth, Dmitry wasn’t disheartened. Instead, he committed himself to fulfilling the contract, marrying into the Brown family as a live-in son-in-law.
For eight years, Dmitry worked tirelessly, even having a child, Cyril, with Dalena, who took on the Brown family name.
He thought life would remain stable, but recently, a crisis hit the Jones family, and Fabio returned home after his divorce.
That very day, Dalena sped to the airport at 200 km/h to pick him up, throwing him an extravagant welcome party and gifting him luxury watches and cars worth millions.
Their old flame reignited, and they began reconnecting more frequently.
To push Dmitry out faster, Fabio deliberately got close to Cyril and fed him all sorts of negative remarks about his father.
Soon after, the once-cold and aloof Cyril began affectionately calling Fabio "Daddy."
Dalena, who never cooked, personally made warm treats for Fabio.
Dmitry understood that he no longer had a place in this family.
But it didn’t matter anymore.
In a week, he would finally leave this house, where he had been trapped for ten years, to pursue his grand musical dreams.
Dmitry drafted the divorce papers and waited quietly for the mother and son to return.
Half an hour later, the villa’s front door opened.
