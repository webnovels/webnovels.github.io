I sealed all windows except for the balcony, making sure the house wouldn't get damp later, then I checked my phone.

The class group chat was still flooded with messages.

"Haha, the heavens sent us water! The field was just tilled, perfect for planting! I'm going to grow a whole vegetable garden in these ten days!"

"Good haul, guys! Just went to sea and caught a few big fish! Fish BBQ party tonight!"

Chloe also sent a photo: a beach and palm trees on an island, with a mountain of supplies in the center of the frame.

Cases of bottled water, vacuum-sealed meats, canned goods, and even a few bottles of red wine.

A few guys were gathered around her, their faces plastered with fawning, 'look what I got for you' smiles.

"Oh my, I just can't with them~"

"I told them not to give me so much! Good thing my portable space is big enough, so I'll grudgingly help everyone store it~ To be fair, if anyone needs anything, remember to register with me, okay~"

Messages of envy and flattery flooded the screen.

Some also grumbled about the piled-up resources.

"...So much stuff, can it really all be registered and distributed? Feels like it'll be a mess..."

"Alex, what do you mean? Are you questioning Goddess Chloe?"

"Chloe is doing this to prevent a free-for-all! If you're not happy, go team up with Iris! Her crappy high-rise, not even a bottle of water there, absolutely no one will fight you for anything!"

I closed the group chat, and with the sound of rain outside my window, I fell into a deep sleep.
