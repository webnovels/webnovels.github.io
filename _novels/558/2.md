After enduring dozens of mockery messages, Finn finally stepped in to restore order.

"Hey, everyone, stop fighting! Admin, when does it start?"

**[One more option: your ability for the coming week.]**

1.  Infinite fresh water resources.
2.  Invulnerable steel body.
3.  Teleportation.
4.  Infinite storage space.
5.  Reverse photosynthesis.

The chat instantly grew serious. Everyone started analyzing these abilities for high-temperature survival rates.

Chloe got excited, giving a bunch of totally illogical advice, urging her male admirers to pick the infinite fresh water resource, claiming it would boost their survival rate.

She chose infinite storage space herself: "I can help everyone store resources and avoid conflicts, after all, you're all my good little babies~"

Finn chose teleportation: "I can instantly go to your locations to save people."

In the end, no one chose option 5. Except me.

I was mocked for dozens of messages again.

"What kind of weird ability is that? Sounds like some random filler picked by the test setter to make themselves look smart."

"Hahahaha, what the hell did Iris pick? Doesn't that mean she gets hungrier in the sun? Won't she die even faster?"

"Must've studied herself silly. Good thing we're not in the same safe house as her!"

"Some people act like Miss Perfect on her high horse, but now she's just picking random abilities for herself. She should learn from Chloe and actually think about others!"

I just took all their mockery, saying nothing.

Finn, however, seemed to sense something subtly. He private messaged me.

"Why are you being so foolish? You'll be eliminated so quickly!"

"Are you still mad I rejected your confession? Are you trying to make me worry this way?"

I rolled my eyes and blocked him.

Back in the group chat, everyone had confirmed their choices. The admin spoke again.

**[Preparations complete. Game starting soon.]**

**[Admin privileges will be disabled on the third day. Everyone can modify their teams before then.]**

**[Deploying safe houses.]**
