On that scorching summer day, my whole class and I were dragged into a strange group chat.

**[Hello, 50 Hosts. Your group admin is the Apocalypse System.]**

**[Survive for one week in the game, and you’ll receive a 100 million bonus.]**

As if expecting skepticism, it immediately sent out a 1 million cash bonus in the chat.

The students, who'd initially thought it was a prank or scam, instantly perked up. They frantically scrambled to split the bonus.

"Holy crap, a week from now, I'll be set for life!"

"Quick, open it! Open it!"

Only Finn, the class Vice President, seemed confused.

"And if we don't make it, do we die?"

**[A total wipeout will reset the game. If there's a winner, the game closes. Mid-game quitters must return the 1 million.]**

Everyone exploded. Those who hadn't snatched a bonus screamed even louder.

"See, I knew it was a scam! I'm leaving the group!"

"Go ahead, let's see if you really have to return the 1 million."

But half an hour passed, and the number of members didn't drop.

Everyone was successfully hooked.

The admin ignored the commotion and presented an option.

Choose your safe house:

1.  A 20th-floor apartment in a downtown city complex, no water, no electricity.
2.  A countryside cabin, suitable for farming.
3.  An uninhabited island, rich in food resources.
4.  A city air-raid shelter, sturdy door, low temperature.
5.  A food factory, abundant resource reserves.

"Vice President, pick the food factory! You're always so nosy and like managing things anyway."

"Yeah, Iris, then we can be merciful and team up with you."

Ultimately, no one chose option 1. Except me.

Chloe, the school's queen bee, gasped dramatically.

"Iris, are you insane? A high-rise apartment with no water or electricity in a high-temperature apocalypse? You'll be baked alive by the third day!"

"Is it because you want to seem trendy living in the city, so you picked it without thinking it through?"

"And she's the Vice President, how dumb~"

Chloe was usually everyone's darling. As soon as she spoke, several guys agreed with her, mocking me. Even a few students who were about to pick option 1 canceled and chose something else.

Five minutes passed, options closed, and the admin spoke again.

**[Each Host is a temporary administrator. Hosts with the same option can choose teammates. Teammates will be allocated to the same safe house by default.]**

Chloe immediately got excited.

"Are there any lucky souls who chose the island like me? We can have a party there!"

As soon as she said that, a dozen guys jumped out, begging to team up with her.

She beamed, then mockingly @-ed me.

"Oh my, so many classmates want to team up with me! Maybe I can spare a few for Iris @Iris? No one picked her, how pathetic!"

Yes, everyone had teamed up. Except me.
