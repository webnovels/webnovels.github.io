For thirteen years, I’ve been the Head Chef at the most exclusive private high school in the city, feeding the kids of the ultra-rich. They call it the cafeteria, but my food is the real draw. I’ve spoiled every single one of those privileged palates.
We weren't wealthy, but my husband, Scott, was honest and hardworking, and our daughter, Tess, was bright and beautiful. I always felt like my life was perfectly—simply—happy.
That was until my ten-year-old, Tess, got into a minor spat with a few mean girls at her elementary school and was shoved off a fourth-floor roof.
My honest, gentle husband went to the school seeking justice and was thrown out of a black SUV at the school gates, his legs broken, like trash.
That afternoon, I was sitting by my serving window, wiping away quiet tears, when a hand lightly touched my shoulder.
"Aunt Brenda, what’s good for lunch today?"
I hastily rubbed my face. I looked up to see a group of the usually loud and joking students standing there, their expressions unexpectedly serious.
“Aunt Brenda, who hurt you? Why are you crying?”

The morning started with soft, fat snowflakes drifting past the window.
I pulled out the fresh ingredients I’d prepped the night before, chopping them fine, mixing them into the seasoned meat, and kneading the mixture until it was firm. I added the flavorings and a drizzle of hot oil, and the aroma instantly blossomed.
I glanced over at the giant stockpot — the cream stew had been cooking, turning a milky white, bubbling softly. I pulled out the cooked chicken breast and sliced it thin, then started making a huge stockpot of hummus. Only then did I begin making the sandwiches.
The lunch bell was a chaotic explosion, and moments later, the students flooded in.
Jax Peterson, the most notorious troublemaker, was the first one to the window. “Aunt Brenda! I’m starving. What’s the special?”
I smiled back. "It's the first real snow, honey. I made four kinds of sandwiches. If you don't want sandwiches, there’s lamb broth, and if you want hummus, I have that beautiful cream stew!"
Right behind him, Caleb Harrison, who’d grown up with Jax, strolled in slowly. “All this variety, Aunt Brenda? Aren’t you working yourself too hard?”
He leaned closer. “By the way, my father said your raise for next year is basically confirmed. And the European study tour the school organizes over the summer? You can bring Tess. The school will cover all the expenses. Come hang out with us.”
Caleb was the Chairman of the Board’s son. He looked distant, but when he spoke, the matter was settled.
I beamed, my face splitting into a wide grin, and served him a huge bowl of the lcream stew, the meat piled high like a little mountain.
Jax, standing next to him, immediately protested. “Aunt Brenda, you’re playing favorites! Why does his bowl have more meat than mine?”
"You’ll both get plenty! There’s plenty in the pot. Come back for seconds if you need to!" I gestured to the bounty behind me. “It’s all yours!”
Jax almost jumped for joy. “Woo! Aunt Brenda, I love you!”

I grew up poor, the eldest of three, cooking for the whole family on a stool by the stove by the time I was seven. When I finished middle school, my father, puffing on his cheap, hand-rolled cigarette, told me they couldn’t afford high school.
The next day, I shredded my acceptance letter, packed a flimsy duffel bag, and caught the northbound train. I was fifteen.
I started on an electronics assembly line, then lucked into a big restaurant as a line cook’s assistant. The head chef, seeing I was diligent and just a kid, took pity on me and taught me the real craft. I used my savings for night school and got my certification. When I was twenty-one, I landed the job here at this elite school.
Thirteen years. It went by in a blur.
After I finished the kitchen clean-up at three o’clock, I went to pick up Tess from her elementary school nearby.
She’s ten years old, in fourth grade.
When she saw me, she presented a certificate like a trophy. "Mom! I won first place in the city-wide writing contest! My teacher said I get to go to the national competition next month!"
My hands shook. I pulled her into a tight hug. "Oh, Tess! My brilliant girl!"
"Tell me what you want for dinner. Tonight, your dad is cooking!"
Tess’s ponytail bounced as she skipped along, holding my hand.
That’s when I felt the icy prickle on my back—like someone was watching us.
I turned around. Two girls about Tess’s age were standing by the school entrance, glaring at us with a cold, malevolent gaze.
"Who are they, sweetie?" I asked Tess.
Tess followed my eyes, and her face immediately fell. "We used to be best friends."
"She wanted me to pass her a note during the last test, and I said no. Now she’s not speaking to me." She looked up, worried. "Mom, did I do the wrong thing?"
I shook my head, squatting down to smooth her wind-blown hair. "No, Tess. You did exactly the right thing. That kind of friend is no loss."
That evening, Scott came home at six.
He was carrying a fancy box from an upscale bakery. It was to celebrate Tess’s award.
“And, you know... to celebrate our twelfth anniversary.”
I flushed a little. "We’re old news, Scott. You don't need to do all that sentimental stuff..."
His own face turned red. He scratched his head. "The lady at the bakery said anniversaries need ‘rituals.’ You relax, I’m cooking tonight."
Scott was a quiet man, not one for flowery words. He just worked hard. Soon, a table full of our favorite food appeared. We lit the candles.
Tess closed her eyes, making a wish. "I hope our family of three stays together forever, and Mom and Dad are healthy, and we get richer!"

Since the school was far from home, I usually stayed in the staff dorms during the week and only came home on weekends.
When I went back to school on Monday, Scott handed me a large bag of his new pastries.
“A few of your students helped me out a while ago. There was some trouble at the shop, and they stepped in, then bought a ton of stuff. Give these to them as a thank you.”
After the lunch rush, I gave the pastries to a few of the girls I knew best.
Jax, with his hawk-like eyes, saw the treats and started to wail. "Aunt Brenda! Playing favorites again! Why do the girls get all the goodies and I don’t?"
One of the girls rolled her eyes. "Got a problem with that?"
"No, no problem," Jax said, grinning as he sidled closer. "I just wanted to ask Aunt Brenda for the bakery's number. I need to buy some for my little sister."
"Cut it out. If you want one, just ask. You always use your sister as an excuse."
Listening to the kids’ noisy banter made my heart warm.

When I first started here, I was a stranger to all the students.
It wasn't until my third year that a particular girl caught my attention.
Every day, she would linger at the serving window, eventually taking only the cheapest vegetable dish. I knew the drill: this school wasn't just for the trust fund babies; they had a few merit scholars from tough backgrounds.
So, every time I served her, I’d secretly bury a few pieces of short rib or baked salmon under the mountain of pasta. It was my quiet ritual.
A few days later, the girl brought the tray back and, without a word, pushed it toward me.
“I don’t like salmon, and I didn’t order this. Why did you decide to do this?” Her face was cold.
That’s when I saw the shiny, expensive bracelet on her wrist. I realized I’d misjudged, and my face went hot. “I’m so sorry… I’ll get you a fresh plate right away.”
My intention was simple: I’d suffered because of a lack of education and money. I wanted these kids to eat well and feel strong. You need fuel to study.
I gave her a new plate of food.
She was about to leave when she saw me serve the next student—a skinny boy—and saw my hand instinctively give his plate an extra box of milk.
She paused.
A moment later, she walked back to me. “I apologize. My attitude was wrong just now.”
I stared at her, confused.
“I thought… I thought you recognized me as the Chairman’s daughter and were trying to suck up to me.”
Her name was Skylar Harrison, Caleb’s older sister.
She told me she usually ate at home and had only come to the cafeteria that day because she’d fought with her family.
From then on, we became friends. Whenever I introduced a new dish, I’d always ask Skylar to try it.
"Aunt Brenda, these chicken wings are amazing. What’s the secret?"
"I tried marinating them in a little plain yogurt."
"That’s a French technique, Aunt Brenda. You know French cuisine?" Her eyes went wide.
I laughed, a little embarrassed. "French or not, I just experiment. I love looking at cookbooks."
“Seriously,” she said. “Your talent is wasted in a cafeteria. If you opened a private supper club, you’d be famous.”
I had considered it. But…
"I don't know," I said, thinking it over. "Being here, with all these young people, it just feels… secure." Watching these bright, lively kids, it felt like I’d finally finished the high school I never got to attend.
Thirteen years.
I’d just finished the lunch rush that day when Tess’s homeroom teacher called.
"Mrs. Miller, you need to come to the school. Tess is in trouble."
My stomach dropped. "What happened?"
"A fight with a classmate. It’s gotten complicated. We need to have a meeting with the parents."
Jax, who hadn't left yet, asked, “Aunt Brenda, what’s wrong? You look sick.”
I was already ripping off my apron and heading for the door. “Nothing. I just have to run down to the elementary school.”
“If you need anything, Aunt Brenda, just say the word!”

I threw open the office door and immediately saw Tess. Her ponytail was pulled out, and there were two bleeding scratch marks on her cheek.
Standing opposite her was Madison Sinclair, the girl who had been glaring at us from the school entrance last week.
Madison’s mother, Veronica Sinclair, was next to her, dressed in an expensive designer coat. She was holding Madison’s arm and yelling at Tess. “Such a vicious little brat! Look what she did to my daughter!”
Her sharp, manicured nail was dangerously close to Tess’s eye.
Rage flashed through me. I bolted forward, shielding Tess with my body. “Get away from my child!”
I knelt down, quickly checking Tess over, and only when I confirmed there were no other injuries did I let out a breath.
Veronica Sinclair looked me up and down, sizing up my work clothes, which I hadn't had time to change out of. She let out a sneering laugh. “Who do you think you are, talking to me like that? Do you even know who I am?”
I took a deep breath. “I don’t care who you are. Let’s talk facts, not bullying a child with your supposed power!”
The homeroom teacher, Ms. Adams, finally intervened. “Alright, alright, let’s all calm down.”
It turned out that Madison had been spreading a rumor that Tess’s award-winning essay was copied from her. Tess demanded an apology; Madison refused, and they got into a shoving match.
Ms. Adams tried to smooth things over. “While Madison was certainly out of line, Tess did strike first. How about you both apologize, and we can move on?”
I immediately bristled. “Ms. Adams, you can’t look at it that way. If no one had spread lies, would my daughter have hit anyone?”
“I didn’t lie! She’s a copycat!” Madison shrieked. “I wrote that story in my journal ages ago! She stole it when she read my journal!”
“You’re lying!” Tess shook with anger. “I told you the idea first! You wrote it down later!”
Ms. Adams threw up her hands. “See? It’s a ‘he said, she said’ situation. Madison has her journal as evidence. Tess has nothing. Strictly speaking, your daughter is the one in the wrong.”
Veronica Sinclair swelled with righteousness. “Exactly! What kind of values can a low-class family like this teach? This school shouldn’t even let poor students in. They ruin the environment!”
I scoffed. “I wouldn’t be talking about good character. Judging by her mother, the rotten apple didn’t fall far from the tree.”
“You!” Powder flaked off her enraged face.
I didn't back down. I looked her straight in the eye. "My daughter will not apologize. She was defending her honor."
"She is not a copycat."
Just then, the office door opened, and a breathless voice called out. “I agree! I believe Tess Miller would never plagiarize!”

It was Tess’s English teacher, Mr. Grant.
“I just rushed back from the district conference,” Mr. Grant said, catching his breath. “Tess has always been in the top three for writing. Her work is inspired. A student like her would never stoop to copying someone else’s mundane journal entry.”
"That’s what you think," Veronica sneered, dripping with sarcasm. “Who knows what the family taught her? The apple never falls far from the tree, after all.”
I shot back, “Are you introducing yourself?”
Even with Mr. Grant’s support, school rules were clear: Tess had struck first and refused to apologize. She was suspended for three days.
I didn’t argue. I just took Tess’s hand and walked out the school doors.
I took her to the walk-in clinic to get her scratches cleaned, then to a fast-food restaurant and ordered a mountain of food.
Tess chewed on a chicken nugget, her eyes welling up. "Mom, I really didn’t copy anything."
“I know you didn’t,” I said, stroking her hair. “You were good friends, you shared ideas. She took advantage of that.”
"I trust you." I gave her a firm look. "If someone throws mud at you, you throw it right back. You did the right thing."
“We’re not going to school for three days. I’m taking you on an adventure.”
I called in sick to the school and spent the next three days with Tess. We browsed every bookstore in the city, buying all the books she wanted. We called Scott, and the three of us went to the amusement park and rode all the rides we usually felt too guilty to spend money on.
On the day she went back to school, I dropped her off at the gate. “Tess, as long as you know you’re right, stick with it. I will always be your rock.”
A week later, the national writing competition was held.
Mr. Grant was escorting the team. Before they left, I video-chatted with Tess. “Don’t be nervous. Just do your best. I’ll make you a feast when you get back!”
That afternoon, I was at the market picking out a fish when my phone rang. It was an unknown number.
"Hello? Is this Brenda Miller? Your daughter is hurt."
"She turned in her test early, climbed to the fourth-floor terrace, and jumped off!"
7
I couldn’t hear anything else the person on the other end was saying.
My mind was a chaotic hive of buzzing bees, and a sharp pain erupted behind my temples.
I dropped the slippery fish in my hands and ran like a lunatic.
The market floor was slick. I fell several times, scraping my knees, but I didn’t feel the blood seeping through my jeans.
When I finally reached the hospital, the light above the operating room was a blinding, angry red.
Scott was crouched in the corner. A six-foot-tall man, he was huddled in a small ball, hands clutching his head, making a wounded, animalistic sound.
When he saw me, he looked up abruptly, his usually smiling eyes webbed with blood vessels.
“Honey… our Tess…”
His voice was a raw croak. Before he could finish the sentence, tears streamed down his face.
My legs gave out. I collapsed onto the floor.
“What happened? She was fine this morning! Why would she jump?”
Two police officers in uniform walked over.
One of them handed me a printed sheet of paper, his voice flat and official. “This was found on the roof terrace. We’ve interviewed the students at the scene. It’s an apparent suicide.”
“Suicide?”
I snatched the paper.
It held a single, cold, printed line: [I did not copy. But I am so tired. Since none of you believe me, I will die to prove it.]
“Bullshit!”
I crumpled the paper and threw it to the ground. “My daughter has the most beautiful handwriting! She hates typing on a computer! And she told me this morning she wanted my short ribs for dinner! She would never kill herself!”
“Ma’am, please calm down…”
“Calm down? Are you kidding me?” I screamed hysterically. “What about Madison Sinclair? Who else was on that roof besides my daughter?”
The officers exchanged a look of weary helplessness. “The surveillance cameras were non-functional. At the time, your daughter was the only person on the terrace. As for Madison Sinclair, she was confirmed to be in the testing room and has an alibi.”
The cameras were non-functional.
Again.
How could the world be so convenient for the guilty?
The operating room door opened.
The surgeon took off his mask and shook his head. “We saved her life, but she has severe brain trauma and a fractured spine. Whether she wakes up, we’ll have to wait and see.”
In that moment, the sky collapsed.

Tess lay in the Intensive Care Unit for three days.
I was a puppet with its strings cut, moving mechanically—paying bills, signing forms, staring blankly through the glass window.
Scott disappeared.
He said he was going for a cigarette and never returned.
It wasn't until noon on the third day that the school security captain called me.
“Brenda, you need to get back here! Your husband… he’s been badly beaten! He’s at the school gate!”
A deafening roar filled my head.
I stumbled back to the school, arriving just as the lunch period ended.
A crowd had gathered at the gate.
I pushed my way through and saw Scott lying on the asphalt. His two legs were twisted at a gruesome, unnatural angle. His face was covered in blood. He was unconscious.
Next to him was a large, black luxury sedan.
The window rolled down halfway, revealing a meticulously made-up face.
It was Veronica Sinclair, Madison's mother—the woman from the school office.
She held a long, thin cigarette, her eyes coldly contemptuous as they swept over Scott and then landed on me.
“Well, look who it is. The cafeteria lady.”
She blew out a puff of smoke. “Keep your husband on a shorter leash. He showed up at my husband’s office, threatening him with a wrench. The nerve.”
“This was just a lesson—a broken leg. If it happens again…”
She gave a cold laugh and rolled up the window. “Drive.”
The wheels crushed the gravel, and the car sped away.
The students around us were pointing and whispering, but I couldn't hear a word.
I collapsed over Scott, wanting to hold him, but terrified to touch his legs.
“Scott! Scott, wake up!”
The security captain sighed, helping me call 911.
“Brenda, you can’t mess with these people. Her husband is Richard Sinclair, a big real estate developer. They’re connected to the city council, right to the top.”
I looked at my husband, barely alive in my arms, and then thought of my daughter in the ICU.
A feeling of hatred unlike anything I had ever known slithered into my heart like a viper.
Can't mess with them?
The one with nothing has nothing to lose.
They destroyed my home. I will make sure they suffer for it.
