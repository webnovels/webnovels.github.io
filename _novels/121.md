The criminal tortured me to death while my father, a leading detective, and my mother, the chief forensic pathologist, were with my sister Lydia at her competition.

A criminal that my dad had once apprehended sought revenge by cutting out my tongue and using my phone to call him. My dad said just one thing before hanging up:

"Whatever happens, Lydia's competition is the priority today!"

The criminal laughed bitterly, "Seems like I kidnapped the wrong person. I thought they'd care more about their own flesh and blood!"

At the crime scene, my parents were horrified by the gruesome condition of the body, angrily condemning the killer's brutality. Yet, they didn't realize that the person who died such a tragic death was their own daughter.

......
