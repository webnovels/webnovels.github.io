I hadn't celebrated my birthday in ten years, not since my father passed away. I looked around; all the portraits of my father, the head of the Sterling family, on the walls had been replaced with portraits of Arthur.

Mr. Jenkins, the butler, said obsequiously, "The madam specifically ordered it, saying it would make young master Leo happy."

Guests buzzed with whispers. "Did you hear? All those prime commercial properties Mr. Sterling Sr. left behind have been transferred to Mr. Arthur's name."

"Tsk, tsk, the original wife worked hard her whole life, only for it to benefit her step-son."

"Shhh! Keep your voice down. He's the rightful man of the house now."

Arthur stood beside my mother, his tone gentle but every word a stab. "I know young master Julian dislikes me, but today is a joyous occasion. I just wish for one small thing: to serve your mother for the rest of her life, and to care for this home in place of your deceased father." He made no mention that today was also my father's death anniversary.

Seeing my eyes bloodshot, my mother lightly smoothed things over. "Arthur is your elder now. It's kind of him to organize your birthday. Be more generous."

Before her words even faded, Leo appeared, holding Scarlett's hand. "Happy birthday, my prince."

Scarlett spoke tenderly, handing me a black and gold gift box.

"My God! That's the exclusive packaging for the 'True Love's Heart' brooch from Castlerock Auction House!" a guest exclaimed. "A mysterious buyer bought it for an exorbitant price last month. I can't believe it's Ms. Blackwell!"

"What sentimental princess act! Julian's life is too good!"

But I didn't care. Highlight auction piece, sentimental princess act—I didn't care about any of it.

I only cared about the mechanical watch on Leo's wrist. That watch had been passed down from my grandfather and had accompanied my father his entire life. The strap had been replaced seven times, the face broken three times, and he always said the repair costs were enough to buy a new one. Yet, he personally took it for maintenance every year. On his deathbed, my father passed the watch to me, saying this old object would keep me company on my future path.

"Take it off." My voice trembled as I stared fixedly at him.

Leo shivered slightly, his eyes watering, and he glanced inadvertently at Scarlett. The guests were shocked by my bluntness toward Scarlett, all gasping. Scarlett's tone was gentle, yet authoritative. "Julian, stop it. If you like this style, I'll invite the designer to the house tomorrow and have a new one custom-made for you, okay?"

But I heard nothing, only focused on charging at Leo. Scarlett seemed frightened by me. "Julian! Calm down! The doctor said your blood pressure is high and you shouldn't get agitated!"

"Ah!" Leo suddenly fell to his knees, yanking the watch off without loosening the strap, smashing it on the ground. His wrist was covered in bloody scratches, the watch face shattered.

"I know you look down on my father and me! You always bullied me!" In school, he used to self-harm like this, then cry and claim I hit him. Since then, everyone thought Julian Sterling, the eldest son, was arrogant and tyrannical, always picking on others.

Guests whispered amongst themselves, their eyes filled with disdain. "Julian Sterling is indeed arrogant..." "An illegitimate child is still Sterling blood; why be so cruel?"

Scarlett rushed to get gauze to wrap Leo's bleeding wrist, giving me a cold look for the first time. "Julian, apologize."

But I remained unresponsive. Watching my father's heirloom shattered on the floor, my vision blurred. Scarlett looked at me in shock, reaching out to help me. "Julian..."

Just then, Leo pretended to help me up, but as he got close, he suddenly shoved me. My lower back hit a metal railing hard, and excruciating pain instantly spread through my body.

Leo, however, fell into the cake, his face smeared with cream, looking utterly disheveled. "Bro, I just wanted to apologize! Why did you push me?"

"Leo!"
