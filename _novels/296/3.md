Wearing Martha's work uniform, I walked barefoot out of the mansion.

The extended limo parked not far from the gate was my ticket to a new life.

But I didn't expect that at that critical moment, I'd be forcibly dragged back into Julian's mansion by a group of people.

It turned out Julian and Stella had gotten carried away with their games; the dripping hot wax set the sheets ablaze, burning Stella's arm.

Stella's eyes filled with tears, looking utterly pitiful at Julian.

"Julian, my arm is burned. How will I paint now? Please, you have to do something!"

I noticed the dense red marks on Stella's body, and the dog chains, whips, and red candles scattered on the floor.

So, Julian, who was usually so calm and composed, secretly enjoyed this kind of thing.

A bitter laugh escaped me, my heart a dull, numb ache.

Stella noticed my gaze and, whether on purpose or by accident, shifted her body.

A bunny tail dropped from the bed.

She apologized, covering her mouth. "Oh, sorry! Julian really likes little bunnies."

"Quinn, you don't mind, do you? After all, you're older, and you can't play like this anymore, right?"

I looked at the girl's fresh, youthful face, so tender it seemed water could be squeezed from it, and shook my head, smiling faintly.

She still didn't get it: youth is fleeting.

This whole charade was utterly boring. I checked my watch.

"Julian, did you drag me back here just to watch this spectacle? I have somewhere important to be!"

Julian bristled. "Who said you could leave? Do you really think I'll miss you?"

"You think too highly of yourself!"

"I brought you here to take a piece of *your* skin for Stella!"

My eyes widened in disbelief as I stared at Julian.

"Do you know what you're saying? What right do you have to harm my body?"

Julian leaned down, his eyes filled with ruthless intent.

"You're nothing but a dog I've kept around. Don't talk to me about rights!"

"Her delicate skin can't have any scars, so we'll just have to use yours."

"Dr. Evans, proceed!"

A group of people rushed forward and pinned my hands. I struggled desperately, "No!"

But the needle still plunged mercilessly into my skin, and I gradually lost consciousness.
