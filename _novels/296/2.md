Crystal shards flew, slicing my leg open, leaving gashes of varying sizes.

Crimson blood poured from my leg.

He stared at me, his eyes pure ice, devoid of any pity:

"Quinn, you're nothing without me. I bought you one championship; I can damn well buy another one for someone else!"

"You want to leave? Fine. But strip off every stitch of clothing you have on!"

"Every single thing you've ever eaten or worn was provided by me, by *my* family!"

Stella, her eyes red-rimmed from crying, huddled in Julian's arms, trembling.

"Julian, please don't fight with Quinn because of me. It's my fault for being so foolish. I don't want Quinn's artwork, okay?"

A year ago, my friends from my old art circle encouraged me to submit my work to the largest, most prestigious art exhibition in the city.

Many famous masters and influential figures would attend, and my reputation would skyrocket.

But on the day of the exhibition, the name on my artwork was Stella's.

To promote her, Julian pulled strings to replace my name with hers on my artwork, bribing reporters to gush about her 'natural talent' and youthful, delicate face.

I became the talk of the art world overnight. Everyone said the once-celebrated genius artist would soon be Julian's discarded trophy wife.

Julian pulled Stella closer, pressing a heavy kiss on her, but his eyes were still locked on me.

"In this town, *I* make the rules!"

"What's yours is hers! That 'champion' title? I only bestow it on women who know their place and obey me!"

"Guards! Strip her!"

I stared at Julian, my eyes burning. A decade of marriage, and he could be so utterly heartless toward me.

The house staff, caught between us, hesitated, not daring to move.

At the entrance hall, I took off my own blazer, worn over my silk dress, and then my red-soled heels.

The shoes thudded loudly to the floor. "Is that enough?"

I turned to leave, but he ripped my dress.

"You'll leave this dress too, including your underwear!"

I stared at Julian in disbelief. "I bought these clothes myself! They have nothing to do with you!"

He sneered, "You bought them? You've been a housewife for ten years! Where would *you* get money like that? Strip her bare!"

The staff swarmed me, tearing off the last remnants of my dress.

I struggled fiercely, but they kicked my stomach hard. A dark, bloody discharge streamed from my body.

I wrapped my arms around myself, trying to cover my nakedness, biting my lip hard, tears streaming down my face.

He just held Stella, looking down at me with smug satisfaction. "See? That's what happens when you don't listen!"

Stella wrapped her arms around Julian's neck and kissed him.

"Stella's the best girl, Julian. I'll never make you angry, unlike some people who don't know what's good for them!"

Julian's Adam's apple bobbed, his eyes burning with raw desire.

He picked Stella up, and a startled gasp echoed from inside the room.

Martha looked at me, her eyes filled with pity. She slipped off her own jacket and gently covered me. "Oh, honey," she whispered, "what a terrible thing."

I buried my face in the jacket, finally letting out a sob.

I never thought that the home I'd poured ten years of my life into, the only one who'd offer me a shred of dignity, would be Martha, who I'd known for less than three months.
