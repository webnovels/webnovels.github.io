Mr. Thompson asked me why I hadn’t been walking home with Briar lately.
I hesitated for a long time but still didn't tell him about her early relationship.
Though, I figured her parents would find out soon enough.
With Jax by her side, no matter how late she stayed out, Briar always made it home safely.
After school, you could often see them running hand in hand down the street.
Their laughter and playful teasing drifted to my ears, sounding as distant as if from another world.
Some classmates even spotted them at night in the small grove at the park.
Under the dark, windy sky, Jax had Briar pinned against a tree, kissing passionately.
Their reputation instantly flipped. From rebellious, passionate lovers, they became the shameless, scandalous couple everyone whispered about.
Briar was angry at first, but then she just stopped caring, letting them say whatever they wanted.
She continued to spend every waking moment with Jax.
Jax had money and bought Briar many designer lipsticks, so Briar learned how to do her makeup and dress up.
She started looking down on girls who showed up to school barefaced every day, disdaining to stand next to them.
She also looked down on guys who only bought a single boba for dates, secretly calling them poor.
She didn’t understand that in student days, a girl's most beautiful face was her unadorned one.
Youth was them, not them transforming into youth.
Even a cheap boba could leave a lasting impression for many.

The last time Briar spoke to me first was when she threw a small note to Jax during class, accidentally tossing it onto my desk.
“Nerd, pass it over, quick.”
Briar urged impatiently, afraid I might peek.
She no longer called me Asher with a cheerful smile, but adopted Jax’s habit of giving people nicknames.
The next second, the math teacher stood in front of my seat, his face stern as he confiscated the note.
I heard Jax click his tongue in annoyance, kicking his desk leg.
Then he stood up and slammed the door as he walked out.
Briar glared at me, her eyes spitting venom.
She blamed me for getting them caught.
Our math teacher was famously strict. After reading the inappropriate content, he immediately called both sets of parents after class.
Jax’s parents, of course, didn’t show up. They let their son run wild.
Rumor had it, as long as Jax didn’t get anyone pregnant, his parents didn’t care how many girls he dated.
Mr. Thompson, getting the news, rushed back from the construction site, still clutching his hard hat, sweat mixed with dirt caked on his tanned skin.
He finally understood why Briar had changed so much lately; it was because she was always with the school bad boy.
He was utterly disappointed in his precious daughter. Mr. Thompson hit her for the first time.
Briar clutched her face in disbelief, immediately protesting vehemently.
You could hear the furious argument from the other end of the hallway, even sitting in the classroom.
It lasted a whole afternoon.
