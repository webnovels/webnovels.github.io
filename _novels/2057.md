When I was young, my husband died in an accident. 

I became a high-rise window cleaner, risking my neck daily, dangling hundreds of feet in the air, sacrificing everything to put my son through school.

After thirty years of relentless work, I finally made it to the day before my son’s wedding.

I’d planned for this to be my last job, a final hurrah before retirement. 

But as I was cleaning the hotel’s exterior, I glanced inside and saw a wedding taking place. It was my son, Justin, and his fiancée, Chloe.

And standing beside the happy couple, acting as parents?

 My long-dead husband, Ben Carter, and my best friend of many years, Stella Vance!


I rubbed my eyes hard, then looked again, straining to confirm.

The man standing next to my son was undeniably my deadbeat husband, Ben Carter!

His face wasn’t as young as I remembered, but I'd know that face anywhere, even from the grave!

Yet, here he was, my supposedly dead husband, resurrected and standing on stage at my son’s wedding.

He and Stella Vance were holding hands, gazing at each other with sickening sweetness.

A whirlwind of confusion and raw emotion churned inside me. My hands trembling, I fumbled with the safety harness, unclipped myself, and practically clawed my way into the grand hall.

The MC announced it was time for the groom’s speech.

My son, Justin Carter, started with a heartfelt declaration of love for his fiancée, Chloe Thompson. Then, taking her hand, he turned to Ben Carter and Stella Vance.

He dropped to one knee, declaring with deep emotion:

“I, Justin Carter, wouldn’t be where I am today without the meticulous upbringing and guidance of my parents. Especially my mom, Stella, you worked so incredibly hard raising me. You truly deserve all our gratitude, and Chloe and I promise to take good care of you from now on!”

Stella’s eyes welled up with tears, visibly moved.

Ben took the microphone.

“Justin Carter is the pride of our family, the embodiment of our love. Now that our son is married, we hope you two will cherish each other and stay devoted, just like Stella and I have.”

Through the crowded hall, I watched this absurd scene, dumbfounded, my mind reeling, threatening to shatter into a million pieces.

Who raised Justin Carter?

Who was whose true love?

For a moment, I wondered if these past years had all been nothing more than a nightmare.

The guests below were visibly touched, infected by the father and son’s emotional speeches.

Everyone envied Stella, who had such a wonderful husband and son.

No one noticed me as I stumbled, then started walking, towards the stage.

Chloe was the first to see me.

Her eyes wide with shock, she whispered, “What’s Maya doing here?”

The other three heard her and turned their heads to face me.

I walked straight towards them.

Stella’s face went pale, and she instinctively took a step back.

Ben reflexively shielded her.

I stared at Ben.

“Someone tell me, what the hell is going on?”

Justin nervously glanced at the audience below, then stepped forward, grabbing my sleeve.

“Mom, I’ll explain everything later, but please, just leave for now…”

He started to pull me off the stage.

I violently shook him off, my voice sharp with fury.

“Mom? Which one of you is my mom?”

The audience gasped, their faces a mixture of surprise and confusion.

Justin clapped a hand over my mouth, motioned for security to drag me off stage, then turned to the audience and apologized.

“Folks, I apologize, but it seems some crazy woman is spouting nonsense!”

With that, he had them escort me out.

Once backstage, I furiously confronted Justin and Ben, demanding an explanation.

Justin just ignored me.

“Enough! I’m telling you today, in my heart, Stella Vance is the only mother I acknowledge!”

“Just look at yourself, you’re a disgrace! Do you really think you belong with us?”

“No wonder Ben preferred to fake his death rather than stay married to you!”

The words hit me like a physical blow, stealing my breath.

“That’s right, Stella is the only woman I’ve ever truly loved. We’ve been together for ages. My marriage to you? It was just because I pitied Stella, didn’t want her to suffer through childbirth.”

Ben put an arm around Stella and stepped forward.

“Since you know the truth now, let’s be frank. From now on, it’s Stella, Justin, and me. You have no part in our lives anymore.”

“Ben…”

Stella leaned against Ben, feigning fragility, but a smug, victorious smirk twisted her lips.
