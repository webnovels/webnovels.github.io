I had been caring for my husband Marcus for over forty years after he was paralyzed in a car accident shortly after our wedding. It wasn't until he passed away that I discovered he had left a will, bequeathing all our assets to Olivia, a younger woman he knew from college.

I was evicted from the house we had lived in for decades. Leaning on my cane, I shakily made my way to a law firm, hoping to reclaim the property as his wife. To my shock, I was informed that Marcus had secretly divorced me years ago.

Before I could process this betrayal, Olivia sought me out, taunting me with cruel words.

"You didn't know, did he? He was worried about my well-being, so he's been sending me your salary and his pension all these years."

"When you were younger, he didn't want children with you because we already had a child together. Come to think of it, I should thank you for paying to raise our kid."

I was devastated and enraged.

But before I could react, Olivia shoved me into a muddy puddle.

Later, her daughter and a group of delinquents beat me to death after trapping me in a sack.

When I opened my eyes again, I saw my young, newly paralyzed husband Marcus crying pitifully before me.

"Rachel, the doctor says I'll never walk again. How will I find work now?" he sobbed.

I quietly put away the credit card I had prepared to give him and sneered, "What can we do? I guess I'll just have to throw you a grand funeral when you starve to death."
