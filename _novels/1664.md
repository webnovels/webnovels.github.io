Liam missed my birthday again this year.
Because it was also Bella's birthday, his childhood best friend.
I opened Bella's Ins, and sure enough, there was a new post.
"Grateful for your company every birthday. We promise to spend every future birthday together too!"
The photo showed two hands making a heart sign in front of a cake. 
One was Liam's, and he was wearing the designer watch I'd bought him.
I liked the post, put down my phone, and dumped all the homemade dishes I'd carefully prepared—all Liam's favorites—into the trash. 
Then I went to a restaurant, ordered what I liked, and celebrated my birthday alone.
From now on, I vowed to truly celebrate every single one of my birthdays for myself.

Halfway through my meal, Liam called. His voice sounded a little anxious. "Chloe, did you see Bella's Ins post?"
"I did."
"I'll come back after celebrating with her. Next year, I promise I'll be with you. Just be cool about it, don't start anything with me, okay?"
The old me would have cried and made a scene, but not anymore. I simply said, calmly, "Okay."
The next morning, around seven, I was woken by my phone ringing. It only rang three times before stopping. I picked up my phone and saw it was Liam.
He used to always call like this, three rings then hang up, because he was too lazy to use his key to open the door himself.
No matter what I was doing, I'd always rush to let him in immediately.
But not today. I tossed my phone aside, pulled the covers over my head, and went back to sleep.
He knew the spare key was under the shoe cabinet by the door.
I'd been packing until three in the morning last night, and my head was still fuzzy. My phone rang a few more times, but I couldn't even bother to look.
I don't know how long passed before I vaguely heard someone open the door and come in. The door slammed against the wall with a loud bang, then my bedroom door was violently pushed open, followed by Liam's angry accusation.
"Chloe, why didn't you open the door for me? I called so many times! You know I hate using my key!"
I opened my eyes, giving him a flat look. "I was too tired, I didn't hear it."
Liam opened his mouth, but in the end, just said, "I'm starving. Get up and make me some breakfast. I didn't sleep at all last night, I need to eat and then catch up on sleep."
If this were before, I would have scrambled out of bed to make him breakfast. But now, I just said blandly, "I'm really tired too. You can go downstairs and grab something yourself."
Liam was clearly annoyed, but he held it back. "Are you still mad because I didn't spend your birthday with you yesterday?"
"No, don't overthink it."
Liam didn't believe me and started explaining on his own. "Bella's like a sister to me. Her parents died young, who else would be there for her if not me? Don't be so petty, or I'll actually get angry!"
"You're right. You should be there for her. I'm not angry."
I couldn't sleep anymore, so I got up and headed to the bathroom.
Liam grabbed my wrist, reluctantly pulling a bracelet from his pocket. "Here, stop sulking. It's your birthday present. I remembered it's your special year this year."
Looking at the cheap bracelet, with its flimsy metal charms dangling with every movement, it felt so dismissive.
Then I thought about the designer watch Liam wore in Bella's Ins photo, and I couldn't help but let out a self-deprecating laugh.
Turns out, Liam wasn't saving money these past few months to buy me a birthday present. I'd been overthinking it.
I shook my wrist, revealing the watch my mom had sent me a few days ago. "Thanks, but I already have a watch. This one wouldn't be practical to wear with it. You keep it."
Liam snapped, annoyed, "Still saying you're not angry! You used to be thrilled with anything I gave you, but now you're being picky, huh?"
Liam didn't earn much. In the past, his birthday gifts for me were never expensive, just small trinkets costing a few bucks or sometimes he even forgot, but I never minded.
Yet, every year for his birthday, I'd painstakingly prepare a gift. Last week, for his birthday, I gave him a brand-name bracelet.
I was exhausted, truly too tired to argue anymore. I took the bracelet and slipped it into my pocket. "Thank you."
I changed my clothes, ready to leave. Liam quickly asked, "Where are you going?"
"To meet friends. We're doing yoga together."
Ever since I got together with Liam, all my time outside of work belonged to him. I'd be with him, taking care of him, barely having any time for myself.
But not anymore. I was going to live for myself.
