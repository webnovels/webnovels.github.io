After graduating from high school, Rachel was admitted to a prestigious university. She thought that by leaving home, she could escape her mother's favoritism and start a new life. But she didn't expect that her mother's indifference towards her wouldn't change with distance.

Every time she called home, her mother would hastily end the conversation after a few sentences, as if Rachel was just an insignificant person.

As for Tyler, although his grades were poor, their mother was always concerned about him. When Tyler failed the college entrance exam, their mother pulled strings everywhere and spent a lot of money to get him into a private university.

When Rachel found out, she felt even more unfair. She couldn't understand why after trying so hard for so many years, she still couldn't gain her mother's approval.

After graduating from university, Rachel found a good job and her life gradually stabilized. She thought she could finally escape her mother's shadow and start an independent life. But she didn't expect that a phone call from her mother would shatter her peace.

"Rachel, your brother is getting married, and we're short on money. Can you help him out?" Her mother's voice came through the phone, with a pleading tone.

Rachel held the phone, feeling a bitter taste in her mouth. She knew her mother would never actively reach out to her unless it was for Tyler.

"Mom, I have my own life too. I can contribute some money for Tyler's wedding, but I can't cover it all," Rachel tried to keep her voice calm.

Her mother was silent for a moment, then said coldly: "You're the older sister, you should help your brother more. His wedding is a big event, you can't be so selfish."

Rachel's heart felt like it had been pricked by a needle. She couldn't understand why her mother always put Tyler's needs first, while her feelings were never considered.

In the end, Rachel still gave $150,000 for Tyler's bride price and wedding expenses. But she didn't expect that the bride would leave Tyler just a year after the marriage, complaining that he was useless and couldn't make money.

And Rachel's $150,000 went down the drain. That was her hard-earned money, saved dollar by dollar.
