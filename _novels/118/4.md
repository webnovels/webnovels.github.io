To take care of her mother, Rachel had brought her to live with her for the past ten years. She tried her best to provide the best she could.

During the most difficult times, Rachel and her husband Michael would rather live in a basement to rent a small master bedroom with good lighting and ventilation for her mother.

But her mother still often complained. Rachel could only work harder, often working overtime until late at night.

Whenever she opened the door, she would always see her mother sitting drowsily on the sofa. Then her mother would grumble: "You always wake me up so late... Go to sleep earlier next time, don't disturb me..."

Rachel could only apologize repeatedly. Then she would go to the kitchen to eat a quick meal before going to bed.

Although work was tiring, being able to eat the meals her mother cooked still brought a sweetness to Rachel's heart. These were the rare moments when she felt her mother's care.

But unexpectedly, a year ago, her mother suddenly fell ill. Rachel rushed to the hospital every day.

The hospital corridors were filled with the smell of disinfectant. Rachel sat on a long bench outside the ward, her heart full of complex emotions.

Looking at her frail mother lying on the hospital bed, Rachel felt a pang of heartache. Although her mother had always been cold towards her, seeing her mother lying on the hospital bed still made Rachel's heart ache.

"Mom, how are you feeling?" Rachel asked softly.

Olivia opened her eyes, glanced at Rachel, then said flatly: "I'm fine, you don't need to worry about me."

Rachel's heart felt like it had been pricked by a needle. She couldn't understand why her mother was still so cold towards her even at this time.

Just then, Tyler rushed to the hospital.

"Mom, how are you? I heard you were sick and came back immediately!" Tyler rushed to the bedside as soon as he entered, his voice full of anxiety.

Olivia's face immediately lit up when she saw Tyler: "Tyler, you're here? Mom's fine, don't worry."

Rachel stood to the side, watching her mother's tenderness towards Tyler, feeling a pang in her heart. Olivia gently patted Tyler's hand, her eyes full of love, as if he was her only concern.

And Rachel, standing there, felt like an outsider, even her breathing seemed superfluous.

Rachel quietly left the ward, standing in the corridor, tears unconsciously flowing down her face.
