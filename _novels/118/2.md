[Mom, why are you always like this? Tyler is your child, but am I not? Why do you always favor him? You give him whatever he wants, but what about me? I take care of you in your old age, attend to your every need. Forget about your inheritance, I can't even get a word of concern from you!]

Rachel stood in the corridor, her body trembling, tears welling up in her eyes. She wanted to rush back into the room and confront her mother. But she couldn't...

Looking at her mother sitting on the hospital bed, her heart was filled with grievance and confusion. She didn't understand why, from childhood to adulthood, her mother always pampered Tyler while remaining cold towards her.

She remembered when she and Tyler were in school together. Every morning, her mother would prepare a hearty breakfast for Tyler, while Rachel had to make do with leftover rice.

Once, she couldn't help but ask her mother: "Mom, why does Tyler get eggs and milk, while I only have steamed buns?"

Her mother replied without looking up: "You're the older sister, you should let your brother have the better things. He's still growing and needs nutrition."

Rachel lowered her head, silently chewing on the hard bun, her heart full of grievance.

When she entered junior high school, her grades were always excellent, consistently ranking in the top few of her grade. She thought that if she was outstanding enough, her mother would finally notice her. But that wasn't the case.

Once, she ran home excitedly with a perfect score test paper, wanting to share her joy with her mother.

"Mom, I got a perfect score on this test!" she said excitedly.

Her mother was peeling an apple for Tyler and merely grunted without looking up, then continued to hand the peeled apple to Tyler: "Tyler, eat more fruit, it's good for you."

Rachel stood there, the test paper in her hand gradually feeling heavier. She watched her mother gently wiping Tyler's mouth, feeling a pang in her heart.

From then on, she never actively shared her grades with her mother again.
