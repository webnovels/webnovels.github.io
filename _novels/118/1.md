The air in the hospital room seemed to freeze.

Rachel felt her breath stop for a moment. She stared at her mother, her ears buzzing, as if all sounds had become distant and unreal.

"Mom..." Rachel's voice was dry, barely audible. "What... what did you say?"

Olivia's gaze remained on Tyler, as if she hadn't heard Rachel's voice. She gently stroked her son's hand, her eyes full of tenderness and pity.

"Tyler has had it tough these years, always working hard out there, enduring a lot," Olivia said, her voice weak but determined. "Leaving this house and the savings to him is just a small gesture from me as his mother."

Tyler, also shocked by this unexpected windfall, exclaimed excitedly, "Mom, Mom, I don't want it... You need to live a long life, I haven't even had the chance to be filial to you yet."

Rachel felt her heart being squeezed tightly, making it difficult to breathe. She looked at her mother's pale face, suddenly feeling it was incredibly unfamiliar.

Throughout her life, her mother's gaze had never lingered on her for so long, let alone speak to her in such a gentle tone.

"Mom, what about me?" Rachel finally couldn't help but speak up, her voice trembling slightly. "I'm your daughter too."

Olivia finally turned to look at Rachel, but her eyes lacked the warmth Rachel had hoped for. Her gaze remained sharp, even carrying a hint of impatience.

"Rachel, you've always been sensible, never needing me to worry about you," Olivia said coldly. "You have a stable job, a good income, and can take care of yourself. Tyler is different, he needs this house."

Rachel felt her eyes burning, her throat as if blocked by something. She wanted to say something but found her voice choked with sobs.

"Mrs. Clark, are you sure about this distribution?" Mr. Johnson pushed up his glasses, his tone calm and professional. "According to the law, children have equal inheritance rights. If you don't have a special reason, this might cause some legal disputes."

Olivia's eyes suddenly turned sharp as she stared at Mr. Johnson, her tone unyielding: "This is my decision. Tyler is my son, leaving the house and savings to him is only natural."

Tyler stood nearby, his face showing a complex expression. He looked at his mother, then at Rachel, seeming to want to say something, but in the end, he just lowered his head and held his mother's hand tightly.

"Mom, don't say that," he finally spoke, his voice a bit hoarse. "Rachel is your daughter too, I..."

"Tyler, you don't need to say anything," Olivia interrupted him, her tone tinged with fatigue. "This is my decision, and no one can change it."

Rachel felt her heart sinking bit by bit. She looked at her mother's familiar yet strange face, suddenly realizing that she had never truly entered her mother's heart.

Throughout her life, no matter how hard she tried, her mother's gaze always remained on her brother.

She once thought that if she was excellent enough, her mother would eventually notice her existence.

But now, she finally understood that some things were destined to be unchangeable.

"Mom, I understand," Rachel finally spoke, her voice surprisingly calm even to herself. "Don't worry, I won't contest it."

Olivia seemed surprised by Rachel's response, a flash of complex emotion passing through her eyes. She opened her mouth as if wanting to say something, but in the end, just let out a light sigh.

"Rachel, don't blame Mom," her voice suddenly softened, carrying a hint of fatigue and helplessness. "Mom just... just hopes Tyler can have a better life."

Rachel didn't answer, just nodding silently. She felt her eyes burning, but she held back her tears, refusing to let them fall. She knew that at this moment, she had to be strong.

Mr. Johnson looked at Rachel, then at Olivia, and finally recorded the contents of Olivia's will in his notebook.

The atmosphere in the hospital room became heavy and oppressive, with only the ticking of medical equipment sounding particularly clear in the silence.

"Mrs. Clark, I've recorded the contents of your will," Mr. Johnson closed his notebook, his tone calm. "If you have no other requests, I'll proceed with the relevant procedures as soon as possible."

Olivia nodded, a tired smile appearing on her face. "Alright, thank you for your trouble."

Tyler stood nearby, his expression a mix of joy and complexity. He looked at his mother, then at Rachel, seeming to want to say something. But in the end, he just lowered his head and held his mother's hand tightly.

"Mom, get some rest," he said softly, his voice choked with emotion. "I'll stay with you."

Olivia's eyes softened, gently patting her son's hand, a smile of contentment on her face.

Rachel stood to the side, silently watching this scene. She felt as if something had sharply stabbed her heart, the pain almost making it impossible to breathe. She knew she had lost her last glimmer of hope.

"Mom, I'll go out first, you get some rest," Rachel said softly, her voice tinged with fatigue.

Olivia didn't answer, just nodding slightly. Her gaze remained on Tyler, as if she had forgotten Rachel's existence.

Rachel turned and walked out of the hospital room, gently closing the door behind her.

The lights in the corridor were harsh and cold. She leaned against the wall, taking a deep breath, trying to calm her emotions.
