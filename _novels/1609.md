When my boyfriend Ryan returned from his business trip with his first love Chloe, he immediately noticed something different about me.

He pulled strings to help Chloe steal my project, but instead of storming off like I would've before, I threw myself into assisting her—even drafting proposals with enthusiasm.

He sabotaged my hard-earned designs to secure Chloe the year-end bonus, yet I didn't bother defending myself. I took full responsibility and let him mete out whatever punishment he saw fit.

He even fast-tracked Chloe's promotion to General Manager, and still I didn't get upset. I voluntarily signed over all my shares, letting Ryan do with them as he pleased.

Ryan smiled and called me "a good girl," promising a promotion and—for the first time ever—proposing marriage.

But he seemed to have forgotten that during our silent standoff, he'd already signed my resignation papers.

And I'd already ended our relationship.

From that moment on, we were thoroughly finished—no loose ends, no lingering connections.
