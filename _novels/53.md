Married for five years, Finn has been having an affair with his sister's best friend throughout our marriage. He holds a deep-seated hatred for me and keeps me around to make my life miserable. Every year on my birthday, he brings that woman to the Finn Family villa, forcing me to leave. My younger brother is battling ALS, and only the new drug from Finn Corporation offers any hope. So, every year, I quietly step aside for them. But this year, he made me sit outside their bedroom and listen to their intimate moments. The woman's ecstatic moans finally pushed me over the edge, and I fainted. By the time the butler got me to the hospital, I had lost the baby.

"Can't handle a little stress?" Finn sneered at me, his arm draped around the woman. Later, a nurse told me that my brother had visited after they left. "Sister, I don't want to continue treatment anymore. Promise me you'll be happy." That was the last message he left for me. He probably thought I was suffering because of him and felt guilty. Ten years of madness, and suddenly I woke up. The harshest revenge for the weak is making someone lose the power to hurt you forever.
