I had just finished getting bandaged and was sent to the VIP ward when my father called.

Answering the phone, I briefly explained what had just happened.

Thinking of how Dr. Young had selflessly tried to protect me, I couldn't help but feel touched.

After hearing my account, my father could no longer sit still.

"What did you say?! That Charlotte actually tried to cripple your hands? She clearly has no idea of the Lynn family's methods!"

"And that bastard Finn - I'll make them regret ever being born into this world."

I nodded in agreement. "Dad, I want you to cancel all of Finn's inheritance rights and kick him out of the Lynn family."

"Also, Dr. Young - if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have escaped. I'd like to introduce him to you sometime."

My father made a solemn promise:

"Don't worry. From the moment he dared to hurt you, Finn was no longer part of the Lynn family."

"My secretary is coming to pick me up now. Wait for Dad to come back and support you!"

Hanging up the phone, my anxious heart finally settled. I wanted to go to the next room to check on Dr. Young.

Just as I got out of bed, the door was pushed open from outside.

Looking up, I saw Finn walk in with a group of bodyguards. Without a word, he kicked me in the stomach.

"Who gave you the guts to bully Charlotte?" he snarled.

I was kicked to the ground, in too much pain to speak.

I couldn't understand what gave Finn the right to hit me.

He was nothing but an orphan adopted by my parents. If not for my family, he'd probably still be fighting stray dogs for scraps in the garbage.

Before I went abroad at age five, I had treated him extremely well, regarding him as my own brother.

Even after I returned, I had suggested to Dad that Finn and I inherit the family business together in the future.

My family had given him a new life, yet he personally pushed me into hell.

Charlotte, who should have been locked up awaiting my judgment, emerged from behind Finn.

Looking at my wretched state on the ground, she spoke in a sarcastic tone:

"Forget it, Finn. Aria claims to be the richest man's only daughter. We can't afford to offend her..."

Finn let out a cold laugh, looking at me with disdain.

"The Lynn family does have a daughter, but it's not you, you slut who seduced my father to become his goddaughter."

"I've grown up in the Lynn family. How could I not recognize who the real Lynn family daughter is?"

Finn's words left me somewhat confused, but I was absolutely certain I was the real Lynn family daughter.

At this moment, a middle-aged man stepped out from behind Finn.

I recognized him as Gary Lee, my father's deputy. My heart lifted with a glimmer of hope.

Just as I was about to cast a pleading look at Gary, he suddenly stomped on my freshly bandaged wrist.

"Where did this shameless slut come from, seducing the master and now trying to seduce the young master? You even dare to impersonate our young miss."

"Let me teach you a lesson since you clearly don't know your place!"

He ground his foot into my hand, fresh blood seeping through the bandages from reopened wounds.

I stared at Gary in disbelief, my eyes reddening with pain.

"Have you gone mad? I am the Lynn family daughter, the real Lynn family daughter!"

But Gary just sneered.

"I've been with the Lynn family for over a decade. You claim to be the Lynn family daughter, so why have I only ever seen Young Master Finn and never you?"

He grabbed my hair and yanked me up, his tone contemptuous.

"The Lynn family's daughter is the apple of everyone's eye. If you were really the Lynn family daughter, why has Mr. Lynn never mentioned you?"

"No need to explain. Young Master Finn has already told me everything."

"You're nothing but a scheming woman who used your body to force the master to accept you as a goddaughter. The master detests you, so now you're trying to seduce Young Master Finn."

With a few sentences, Gary had branded me a conniving seductress.

I tried to explain through the pain that Dad had hidden my existence to protect me.

To avoid me being targeted, he always pretended to be indifferent when seeing me.

I never imagined this would become their evidence to condemn me.

But before I could open my mouth, Charlotte interjected pitifully:

"I just wanted to advise Aria not to be a homewrecker. I didn't expect her to be so aggressive, directly claiming to be the Lynn family daughter. Won't someone like her tarnish the Lynn family's reputation?"
