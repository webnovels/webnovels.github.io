"I'll hold them off. Run, Aria!" Dr. Young shouted.

I wasn't sure what I was feeling, nor did I have time to wonder why he was here. I shook my head at him weakly.

"No, you should go. Don't worry about me."

I was severely injured and had lost too much blood. Even if I managed to stand up, I wouldn't get far.

I had already caused his death in my previous life. I couldn't let him die for me again.

But it was too late. Dr. Young was kicked to the ground by the three thugs, their fists raining down on him like hailstones.

My heart clenched painfully. I tried desperately to tell them to stop, but to no avail.

Charlotte grabbed my hair, her tone vicious:

"Aria Lynn, I didn't expect your lapdog to be so devoted, actually daring to come save you."

"Well then, I'll grant your wish. You can die together!"

Blood loss was making my vision blur, but I still glared at Charlotte with all my might.

"I advise you to release Dr. Young and me immediately. You can't afford the consequences of hurting me!"

Hearing my words clearly, Charlotte burst into derisive laughter.

She slapped me across the face again without hesitation, her tone mocking:

"Who do you think you are? Finn is the son of the richest man in the country. Don't you believe that even if I killed you, the police wouldn't dare touch me?"

"I'll record a video of you being defiled and post it online. Let's see if you're still so tough then, Aria Lynn!"

Hearing this, the three thugs walked towards me again, lewd smiles on their faces.

Dr. Young used his last ounce of strength to try and grab their legs, but they mercilessly stomped on his arm.

I heard the clear sound of bones breaking. Trembling with rage, I could no longer hold back from revealing my identity.

"Enough! Finn is just an adopted son taken in by my dad. I am the real and only daughter of the richest man in the country!"

"One word from me and Finn will be kicked out of the Lynn family. If you don't stop now, I promise your fate will be a thousand, no, ten thousand times worse than mine today!"

Charlotte froze for a moment. When she understood my words, she laughed even louder.

"Aria Lynn, have you gone mad from failing to seduce Finn?"

"Everyone knows the current richest man's surname is Lynn, and he doesn't have a daughter at all. You didn't even do your research before lying."

My heart sank.

The Lynn family had protected me too well. At the most extreme, even stray dogs passing by my side would be thoroughly investigated.

As a result, my information had never appeared in public.

Additionally, I had taken my late mother's surname. At age five, I had fallen seriously ill and gone abroad for treatment.

Even now, the outside world was unaware that the richest man had a daughter surnamed Lynn.

I gritted my teeth through the searing pain in my wrist, glaring at Charlotte.

"What I'm saying is true. If you don't believe me, you can ask Finn!"

Although I knew Finn wouldn't help me, I could say this now.

I just needed to stall until my dad's people arrived...

"Lies upon lies. You think I'd believe you?!"

Charlotte slapped me twice across the face and yanked me up by my hair.

She gripped my face, gesturing for two thugs to hold down my arms while the third picked up an axe from the corner.

I instantly understood what she intended to do. I struggled violently, desperately headbutting Charlotte.

Caught off guard, Charlotte's nose was struck. Enraged, she turned and slapped me hard across the face several times.

My face stung fiercely, but my entire body had gone cold with fear.

Was I destined to lose my hands even in this second chance at life?

I fell into despair. Just as the axe was about to fall on my hands, the factory doors were smashed open with a thunderous crash.

An SUV charged in at full speed, ramming into the thug holding the axe over me.

The two thugs holding me down were startled and instinctively released me.

Seeing the situation turn against her, Charlotte tried to flee but was immediately pinned down by bodyguards who jumped out of the vehicle.

My father's secretary hurriedly got out of the car, calling for people to take Dr. Young and me to the Lynn family's private hospital.
