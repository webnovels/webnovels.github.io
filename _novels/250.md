Julian, my husband, was ridiculously frugal. He’d kept his phone for five years and refused to get a new one.

To surprise him, I secretly bought him a new phone. But while transferring data, I stumbled upon something horrifying: he had meticulously saved every single chat record with Celeste, the woman he’d lost, his first love.

I intended to hide the chat thread, but my finger slipped, and I accidentally hit 'delete.'

That’s when Julian walked in.

He’d never shown a hint of anger before, but he snatched the phone back from me. When he realized the chat history was gone, unrecoverable, he shoved me, *hard*, then stormed out.

My head slammed against the sharp edge of the table.

As life drained from me, I frantically dialed his number, again and again. Every call was ruthlessly rejected.

The last time I managed to dial, he finally picked up, his voice seething with irritation. “Vera, are you ever going to stop?”

He didn’t know. He didn’t know that the moment he chose those chat records over my life, *I* was already stopped. Forever.
