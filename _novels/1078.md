When the cab stopped halfway up the mountain road, the driver glanced at me several times through the rearview mirror.

"Up ahead is Skyville Manor, Miss," he said. "It's private property. Cabs aren't allowed inside. Are you sure you've got the right place?"

I checked the location Dad had sent on my phone, then looked down at the tracksuit I was wearing. It was the same one I'd thrown on in a rush to catch my flight. It had been so comfortable that I hadn't even bothered changing for two days.

I nodded. "This is it. Thanks."

After I got out, I pulled the brim of my cap lower. 

Dad really did whatever popped into his head.

Last night, out of nowhere, he'd called to tell me he had arranged a blind date for me.

The guy was from the Gray family and was supposedly handsome and talented. To show sincerity, the meeting was specially arranged at this very manor—one of the properties under my name that had been sitting idle.

Specially chosen, huh? More like he wanted to use my place to show off.

I raised my head and looked toward the gate in the distance.

The black wrought-iron gates, usually solemn and imposing, were now wrapped in layers of pink balloons. A banner hung across the top, and on it were bold letters.

"Wedding Celebration of Julian Gray and Bianca Reed."

I froze.

Wedding? 

Dad said this was just a blind date. So why did this Mr. Gray jump straight to setting up a wedding celebration? Was he trying to surprise me and skip ahead to marriage?

But something was off.

Who the hell was Bianca Reed?

Suppressing the anger rising in my chest, I dragged my suitcase toward the entrance. Several security guards were clustered in the guard booth, smoking. 

I didn't bother with them and walked straight in.

"Hey! Hey! What do you think you're doing?"

One of the guards crushed his cigarette and blocked me with a rubber baton. "Go beg somewhere else. Do you even know where this is? Mr. Gray booked the entire venue today. Get lost."

I frowned. "I'm here for Julian Gray."

The guard sized me up, then snorted. "Looking for Mr. Gray? Who do you think you are? Do yourself a favor and look in the mirror."

Just then, a group of people walked over from inside.

The man at the front was wearing a white suit that clearly didn't fit properly, his hair slicked back until it gleamed. He was holding his phone, recording a voice message.

"Mr. Graham, the venue today is quite impressive, right? You've seen what I can do. Gray Group's future investments will depend on you. I even had a bottle of '82 Lafite flown in just for you. I'll send it over right away."

Noticing the commotion at the gate, he lowered his phone and strode over, clearly irritated.

"What's all this noise?" he snapped. "Don't you know I have important guests to entertain?"

The guard's expression immediately changed, appearing meek and obedient. "Mr. Gray, this woman here showed up dragging a busted suitcase and insists she's here to see you."

Julian turned his head, his gaze landing on me. That look in his eyes was like he was picking through rotten apples at the market.

I forced myself to stay polite. "Are you Julian Gray? I'm Vivian Brooke. My family asked me to come."

At the mention of my name, confusion flashed across his face. It then quickly turned into disdain, as if something had just clicked.

He scoffed and adjusted his bow tie. 

"Vivian Brooke?" he asked as he stepped closer, the stench of cheap cologne hitting me square in the face. "Oh, right. I remember now. You're that… What's her name again?" 

He scratched his head exaggeratedly. "Sorry. I've fooled around with too many women. I really don't remember anyone at your level."

My grip tightened on the handle of my suitcase. "What did you just say?"

"Drop the act." Julian waved his hand impatiently, as if shooing a fly. "What, you heard I made it big and moved into Skyville Manor, so now you're here trying to squeeze money out of me over some old nonsense? Keep dreaming!"

He pointed his finger at me, nearly poking my nose. "I've got billion-dollar deals to discuss today. I don't have time to play games with a gold-digger like you. Leave now while I'm still being polite. Otherwise, I'll make sure you won't be able to stay in Solterra."

I stared at his arrogant face. Dad might need to get his eyes checked. This was his idea of young and promising?

"You said this manor is yours?" I laughed, my voice sharp with anger. I pointed at the stone tiles beneath our feet. "Mr. Gray, lies have consequences when you take them too far."

"Oh? You've got some nerve." 

Julian was about to explode when a soft, sweet voice came from behind him. "Honey, who's making you so angry? Don't get too worked up. It's bad for your health."

A woman in a floor-length mermaid gown walked out. Her makeup was exquisite, and around her neck hung a sapphire necklace so familiar it made my blood run cold.

That was my necklace.

It was the very one displayed in the manor's showcase. 

My coming-of-age gift.
