On our wedding anniversary, my wife Rachel, a professional translator, once again received an urgent assignment and couldn't spend the day with me. But before I knew it, she appeared in Ryan's social media video, hurling insults at a group of old ladies in eighteen different languages. Gone was her usual elegant demeanor.

The caption read: "Grandma says having a translator for a daughter-in-law is great. No one in the village will dare argue with me now."

I chuckled and liked the post, commenting: "Quite the spectacle."

My colleagues quickly flooded the comments section, even placing bets on whether I would explode this time.

Rachel immediately called me, her voice cold as ice:

"Jack Thompson, who told you to comment? Are you deliberately trying to embarrass Ryan in front of the team?"

"He was being bullied in his hometown, what's wrong with me showing some support? Someone like you, who's been pampered all your life, wouldn't understand how hard life can be for ordinary people."

"Delete that comment right now. I'll make it up to you with another anniversary celebration in a few days."

I hung up with a bitter laugh, rubbing my aching stomach. In three days, the divorce cooling-off period would be over!
