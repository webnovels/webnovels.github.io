On the day I got my acceptance letters from all the top schools, my billionaire dad told me to pick a fiancé from the roster of brilliant young men he'd sponsored.

In my last life, I chose Trevor, my long-time crush. Who knew that after we married, he'd sell me to the dark web, where I was brutally dismembered and tortured!

My daughter, Lily, begged him on her knees, but he choked her to death right in front of me.

“Daisy! If you hadn't used your dad's sponsorship to force my hand, I never would've missed out on Chloe! She wouldn't have left heartbroken and died in that car crash out in the middle of nowhere!”

“If I had to choose again, I'd throw *everything* away just to never be with you!”

Trevor stomped on Lily's lifeless body, then, amidst my screams, he tossed her into the street, leaving her to be crushed by passing vehicles.

The entire process of my torture and murder was recorded, turned into a video on the dark web, and went viral, racking up hundreds of thousands of views.

When I opened my eyes again, I was back on the day my college applications were finalized, choosing my fiancé.

I ignored Trevor's eager gaze, my finger shooting out to point at Julian, the guy with the absolute worst reputation:

“I want him.”
