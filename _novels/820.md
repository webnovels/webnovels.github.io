"Hello, I'm here to apply for immigration!" Esme Shepherd stood at the counter, handing over her carefully prepared documents to the staff on the other side of the window.

The staff quickly stamped the necessary forms before sliding a paper back to her, saying, "Ma'am, your application will be processed in 15 days. Please be patient."

Esme nodded and turned to leave, but faint whispers from behind stopped her in her tracks.

"Am I seeing things? Why would Mrs. Jabs apply for immigration? Did she have a fight with Mr. Jabs?"

"Even if they fought, isn't this a bit extreme? Everyone knows Mr. Jabs spoils her like crazy. What could possibly make Mrs. Jabs this determined to leave?"

Someone chimed in, "Exactly! Five years ago, their wedding made global headlines, and even I—someone who barely follows the news—heard about it. 

"Then, three years ago, she got into that car accident, and when the hospital ran out of blood, Mr. Jabs didn't hesitate to donate most of his own, saving her life.  And just last year, she disappeared for an hour, and he mobilized every media outlet to search for her. Now she's leaving him like this? He's going to lose his mind!"

Esme smiled bitterly as she walked away, their voices faded behind her. Yes, everyone knew how deeply Isaiah Jabs loved her.

It was practically a legend—Isaiah Jabs, CEO of Jabs Group, ruthless and decisive in the business world, famous for his cold and aloof personal life, and utterly indifferent to women. No one dared to get within three feet of him.

That was, until that fateful gala where he met Esme.

He fell for her at first sight and pursued her relentlessly. Mansions, luxury cars, and priceless jewelry seemed like small tokens to him. He even lit up the night sky with fireworks for three days straight to declare his love. 

Once, she casually mentioned missing a rare chestnut cake that had been out of production for years. That same night, in the middle of a snowstorm, he drove through three cities to find it and returned soaked to the bone, holding the still-warm dessert in his hands.

However, what truly moved Esme was the day her parents tragically passed away in a car crash. Even though Isaiah was miles away on an important business trip, he abandoned a billion-dollar deal without hesitation to rush back to her side.

When he finally arrived, disheveled and sleep-deprived, his eyes bloodshot, he wrapped her in his arms with nothing but tenderness.

"Essie, sweetheart, you still have me. I'll always be here for you."

The depth of his love was written all over his face, and her heart skipped a beat. She told herself he was the one back then.

Sadly, this man, who once had eyes only for her, could not resist temptation three months ago. He gave in and had an affair with the younger sister of his so-called best friend, who was staying at their house.

The evidence was everywhere—the living room couch, the kitchen, even their bed—tainted by the betrayal. Isaiah thought he had hidden it well, but no secret stays buried forever. 

When Esme uncovered the truth, it shattered her. She cried, despaired, and doubted everything, but eventually, she accepted the cruel reality. In the end, she decided to leave him for good.

The Jabs family had a strict tradition spanning three generations. Everyone, including Isaiah, was bound to serve their country and forbidden from leaving it. Once she left the country, he would never be able to find her again.

Esme tucked her immigration documents into her bag, hailed a cab, and headed for Harmony Manor. As soon as she entered the villa, the scent of blooming privet filled her nose. Then, she saw two people decorating the wall and turned at the sound of her footsteps.

Isaiah froze for a moment before his expression softened, his eyes brimming with warmth as he approached and gently took her hand. 

He asked, "Baby, why are you dressed so lightly? Are you cold? Didn't you say you were meeting your friends? How come you're back so soon? I was still preparing a surprise for you."

Esme looked up at Isaiah, puzzled. However, her eyes lingered on his neck. There, barely hidden, was a cluster of unmistakable hickeys. 

Her eyelashes trembled slightly as she struggled to suppress the stabbing pain in her chest. When she did not respond, Audrey Coleman let out a soft, deliberate laugh and strolled over.

"Esme, Isaiah is just so in love with you. He's gone all out for your anniversary of when you first met..." Audrey paused theatrically, then gestured toward the couch piled high with gifts. She exclaimed, "Look at these! All of them are from Isaiah, just for you."

Esme followed Audrey's gaze, but her attention was immediately drawn to the darkened stain spreading beneath the gifts.

In that moment, it felt like lightning struck her. The scent she had noticed earlier, combined with this unmistakable evidence, confirmed the horrifying truth she had suspected.

Isaiah's so-called love for her involved buying her extravagant gifts while passionately entangling himself with Audrey on their couch. They had done it so recklessly that they even left behind a blatant stain.

The pain cutting through Esme was indescribable, sharp enough to pierce her very soul.

Isaiah was oblivious to Esme's turmoil. He took out a necklace he had prepared and gently placed it around her neck. His voice was so tender, it was almost suffocating.
 
"Baby, happy anniversary. I even prepared a candlelit dinner for us."

Esme's body trembled as she shook her head. "I'm not hungry... I don't feel well."
 
Every second spent near Isaiah now was pure agony. She had always told him she had no tolerance for betrayal.

If Isaiah loved her, he would have to love her wholeheartedly. If not, he should have stayed far away. Yet, here he was—professing undying love while tearing her heart apart.

When Isaiah heard her say she was not feeling well, he immediately panicked. He called several private doctors to examine her, and when they found nothing wrong, he was still unsatisfied.

Later, Isaiah sent his assistant out to buy an assortment of herbal remedies and brewed some warm milk himself for her. He fussed over her for about five hours until she finally fell asleep.

...

Esme woke up in the middle of the night, parched. She quietly got out of bed, intending to fetch some water. However, the moment she opened the door, she froze.

The door to the guest room across the hall was wide open, and the pale moonlight illuminated the bed. There, she saw Isaiah, his body tangled with Audrey's, both of them naked.

"That necklace you gave Esme today is worth millions," Audrey said, her legs still wrapped around his waist, her tone dripping with jealousy.

"I begged you for so long, and you wouldn't give me one. Yet Esme didn't even lift a finger, and you handed it to her without hesitation."

Isaiah frowned, pulling away from her and sitting at the edge of the bed to light a cigarette. He said coldly, "Have you forgotten your place? I've told you—I only love Esme."

"If you want this arrangement to continue, it has to stay a secret. If she finds out, you know what'll happen."
 
Audrey's face paled, but she climbed up behind him, wrapping her arms around his torso and pressing her bare chest against his back.

"I know you love her," she whispered, her voice laced with desperation. "But I love you too. Can't I just be a little jealous?"

Isaiah did not respond. Instead, he bent down, pulled a box from the drawer, and handed her a necklace—identical to Esme's, but in a different color.

He warned, "Stop acting pitiful. Here, I got you one too. But you can only wear it in private. If she ever finds out, this is over."

Audrey's face lit up as she quickly took the necklace and held it against the bruises on her neck.

"Thank you, Isaiah! I knew you cared about me too," she purred, her voice sickeningly sweet. "But are you really that scared of Esme leaving you?"

Without a second of hesitation, he replied, "Yes. If she leaves me, I'll lose my mind."

As soon as the words left his mouth, he pinned Audrey beneath him again, their bodies moving together as the bed creaked loudly. Her moans filled the air, one after another.

Standing frozen in the doorway, Esme watched, tears streaming silently down her face. Her red, swollen eyes shifted to the wedding photo on the wall, Isaiah's smiling face staring back at her mockingly.

"Isaiah, I can't wait to see you lose your mind," she whispered hoarsely, her voice trembling with heartbreak.
