Caspian.

He sat there, looking uncomfortable.

Adeline is my girlfriend. How can I let another man kiss her?

I stood up abruptly.

"I'll take her place!"

People around us laughed.

"No way, the game rules say no replacements!"

Caspian took a deep breath and stood up.

He walked to Adeline without a word.

Adeline acted as if nothing was wrong.

She turned to me and said, "It's okay, just buddies having fun, don't take it seriously."

I got anxious.

"Adeline, if you kiss him, we break up."

Adeline paused, then impatiently waved her hand.

"Oh, stop it, it's just a game, don't make a fuss."

She turned her head, closed her eyes, and tilted her face up.

Caspian looked at me provocatively, then leaned down and kissed Adeline.

I felt my blood run cold, my heart clenched by an invisible hand, making it hard to breathe.

They kissed for a full minute.

A minute felt like an eternity, leaving me completely chilled.

3.

The second round of truth or dare continued.

This time, it was my turn.

I picked another card from the table.

[Choose an opposite sex present to spend a night alone with.]

I read the card's content, a cold smile on my lips.

"Wow, this is interesting!"

Adeline wrapped her arm around mine, nearly leaning on me, laughing wildly.

"Do you even need to choose? My boyfriend, of course, I’m the one to spoil him!"

Her eyes darted towards Caspian, clearly trying to make him jealous.

I shook off her hand.

Coldly, I said, "It says 'my choice.'"

I looked around and finally fixed my gaze on the quiet girl in the corner.

Nora, the boss's daughter brought here to "see the world."

She seemed scared by the chaotic scene, shrinking into the sofa corner, head down, fingers nervously twisting her clothes.

I walked over to her and held out my hand.

"Let's go."

Nora looked up in surprise, glancing between me and Adeline, her eyes full of confusion.

"I..."

"Come on~"

I grabbed her hand and pulled her up from the sofa.

"Hey, what are you doing!"

Adeline finally realized something was wrong and shouted.

I ignored her, pulling Nora with me as we left.

"Hey! Come back here!"

Adeline yelled, frustrated.

Her girlfriends saw the situation.

"Go after them!"

"They'll be gone if you don't!"

But Adeline just sat on the sofa, crossing her legs, indifferent.

"Why chase them? Don't I know him? His parents are highly educated, there's no way he'd do anything inappropriate. Besides, he needs my support for his career."

She took a sip of her drink, smirking.

"Nora is a good girl too, all fake propriety, super conservative, let him go."
