Caleb's relief was almost palpable when he heard me suggest divorce.

He quickly helped Sera to her feet, adjusted her hospital gown, and gently scolded her. "You just healed, and you're already worrying me. My Aubrey is so kind, stop kneeling all the time."

Sera, her face pale, shook her head. "You don't understand, only a woman truly understands another woman."

"You see Aubrey acting all calm and composed, but she's really hurting inside. Promise me, you'll spend some real time with her."

Every word she spoke sounded perfectly reasonable and compassionate to Caleb.

But I knew, she was rubbing it in my face, flaunting the undeniable intimacy she shared with Caleb.

Caleb glanced at me, then seemed to realize something. "Aubrey, why are you at the hospital?"

I felt the cold ache radiating from my lower abdomen.

I hid my trembling hands.

I thought of the phone call I hadn't made, not wanting to distract Caleb from his mission.

A self-mocking smile touched my lips. "Just visiting a friend," I said softly.

But Caleb reached for my hand, finding it icy cold. I pulled away as if I'd been shocked.

Sera gasped dramatically at just the right moment, diverting his attention.

He pulled out a tissue and, with practiced ease, wiped her forehead. "I told you to stay in bed. Everything's resolved now, let me help you back to rest."

Then he turned back to me. "Aubrey, you can go back by yourself. Sera was injured for me, after all. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I didn't stay with her for a couple of days."

I walked out in silence.

Caleb called out to me. "Oh, Aubrey, I've already prepared the divorce papers. Remember to sign them."

I hung my head low, stubbornly refusing to let my tears fall.

As I walked out of the hospital, I saw Caleb's parents.

Of course, I only knew who they were after doing my own research.

Caleb had never introduced me to his family.

They were holding onto each other, their voices full of satisfaction and relief. "Last grandchild, you gave fifty million. This time, it needs to be double!"

"Right, right! And we need to arrange the wedding quickly. Our grandson's mother is Miss Kingston, she absolutely can't be an illegitimate child!"

"What illegitimate child? Our Caleb isn't even married yet."

My hands clenched tightly. So Caleb had never told his family about my existence at all.

And he and Sera already had another child on the way.

Tears finally, unwillingly, streamed down my face.

I raised a hand to wipe them away.

The jade bangle on my wrist slipped from my sleeve.

Mrs. Davies, sharp-eyed, immediately stepped forward, grabbing my hand, her voice sharp. "Who are you? How dare you steal my daughter-in-law's bangle!"

I was about to protest.

But the Davies' bodyguards stepped forward and restrained me.

Mrs. Davies tried to yank the bangle from my wrist, instructing the bodyguards to call the police.

Hearing the commotion, Caleb rushed over, panicked.

"Mom, Dad, you've misunderstood. This is... one of our family's bodyguards. She's just helping Sera take her things back."

I stared at him, seeing that familiar plea in his eyes.

It was the same look he had when he begged for my forgiveness after sleeping with Sera three years ago.

Suddenly, I felt utterly disgusted.

I deliberately slipped the bangle off my wrist and placed it in Caleb's hand. "Mr. Davies, returning what's rightfully yours."

Caleb's face went ashen. He lowered his voice, his tone tense. "Aubrey, wait, I'll explain everything later..."

I curved my lips into a cold smile. "No need. Wouldn't want your family to misunderstand."

Then, without looking back, I left.

Once on the street, I pulled out my phone and dialed. "Your offer, I accept."

The voice on the other end was low. "Good. Don't worry. In three days, you will 'die' taking a bullet for Caleb. After that, you will only ever be Mrs. Kingston."

I hung up.

A cold laugh echoed in my mind. Caleb Davies, since you choose Sera every single time.

This time, I'll make sure you lose me forever because of her.
