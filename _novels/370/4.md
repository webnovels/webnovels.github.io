"Aubrey, can you help me with my tie?" His voice was intimate and lazy.

It gave me a fleeting illusion that we were back to the beginning.

But seeing the hair tie on his wrist, which wasn't mine, immediately brought me back to reality.

Just as I was about to refuse, his phone rang.

Sera's voice, sickly sweet, came through the speaker. "Caleb, can you come help me zip up my dress?"

Caleb hesitated for a moment, then nodded gently. "Wait for me."

Then he grabbed the silk tie and left without a backward glance.

I changed into the dress I wore the day Caleb and I first met.

I placed the lucky charm we'd gotten together inside the chest of my dress.

I numbly watched Caleb lift Sera into the wedding car.

Her long wedding dress didn't even touch the ground.

He turned and saw me.

He hurried over.

The scent of freesias from Sera's dress clung to him.

He tried to put the ring box into my hand. "Aubrey, when it's time to exchange rings, bring them up to us."

I looked at him steadily, not taking it.

He shoved it into my arms, his face full of impatience. "Aubrey, not now. Don't make a scene."

I dodged his hand as he tried to pat my head. He awkwardly lowered it. "I'll come back to you tonight."

I didn't answer.

I glanced around.

I wondered where *that person* would appear.

Soon, we arrived at the wedding venue.

It was an outdoor setting, flowers everywhere.

Guests gathered in small groups.

Caleb's family sat on a long bench.

The child was held by Mrs. Davies.

The family looked happy and harmonious.

Only I had foolishly waited for his promise to leave the mercenaries in three years.

When it was time to exchange rings, Caleb and Sera's eyes locked, practically melting together.

He didn't spare a single glance for me, standing right beside them.

As the wedding atmosphere reached its climax, the child in Mrs. Davies's arms suddenly started crying.

In the confusion, Caleb rushed off the stage to check on the child.

Bang—

A gunshot rang out.

The crowd erupted in chaos.

Sera clutched her stomach, crying out in pain.

Caleb rushed back, scooped up Sera, and began to leave.

He looked up at me, his eyes darting away. "Aubrey, Sera's pregnant, hide yourself. I..."

Before he could finish, a whistling bullet pierced my chest.

Mrs. Davies had pushed me, making me shield Caleb.

"Let this bodyguard take the bullet! Son, grab your daughter-in-law and run!"

Caleb stared at me in a panic, his voice trembling. "Aubrey, wait for me, I'll call an ambulance."

I collapsed to the ground, blood gushing from my chest.

Though the blood was fake, watching him walk away with Sera without hesitation,

The heart that had beaten for him for five years finally died.

Caleb Davies, we are over.

A few days later, it would be the grand wedding of Miss Kingston and the heir to the Kingston family.

Caleb placed Sera in the ambulance and was about to grab a nurse to rush back.

"Quick, hurry back with me to save Aubrey!"
