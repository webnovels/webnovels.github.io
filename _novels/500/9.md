I was stunned.
So that was his first kiss. No wonder it was so bad.
I looked up at him honestly. "Uh, given the experience, it wasn't even worth a breakfast."
If it had been Ethan's kissing skills, I'd buy him a building, really.
Zack froze, mumbling. "The experience wasn't good?"
He seemed devastated, sitting on the couch with his elbows on his knees, fingertips supporting his chin.
"You're saying the experience wasn't good?"
I was silent for a moment, then poked his shoulder. "Stop repeating yourself. Are you okay?"
It was just a one-second lip touch, what kind of experience could it be?
Zack suddenly turned to look at me.
His expression went from disbelief to sudden realization.
He burst out laughing. "I get it! You're doing this on purpose. You're trying to provoke me into kissing you again so you can seduce me and achieve your nefarious goals!"
I was startled, leaning back, accidentally falling off the couch onto the floor.
"Ah—"
"Tsk, such tactics."
Zack put his hands in his pockets, looking down at me.
Just then, the front door opened.
Ethan stopped in the entryway, expressionless as he looked at us, his thin lips pressed into a straight line.
Zack casually stepped back.
"Ethan, you're back. Why did you have her wait here? She just tried to seduce me, but luckily I have an iron will!"
Ethan's eyes narrowed slightly, his tone cool. "Mm, I told her to wait for me."
As he walked over, he took off his coat, crouched beside me, gave me a cool glance, draped his coat over my legs, put one arm around my waist and the other under my knees, and lifted me onto the couch.
I instinctively put my arms around his neck, all my attention on Ethan.
From this upward angle, his skin really was pale, his Adam's apple moving silently, his collarbone disappearing into the shadows of his shirt. His eyes behind those thin glasses were intensely focused, and his body temperature was just right.
As he was about to set me down, his movements gradually slowed. He lowered his head, coming close, his voice barely audible.
"No matter what, I'm happy to see you when I got back."
His warm breath brushed past my ear.
It felt like something collapsed inside me. I stared up at him, my fingertips unconsciously gripping his coat tightly.
Ethan's lips curved.
He set me down and turned to look at Zack, his voice displeased. "Don't push her to the ground."
So he thought Zack had pushed me...
Zack protested on the spot. "I didn't push her, she's faking it!"
Ethan ignored him and poured me a glass of water.
"Why did you wait for me? Have you decided?"
I sat beside him, holding the glass with both hands, my heart pounding non-stop.
"The piano arrived. Don't you want to try it?"
He turned to look at me, his expression cool. "Together?"
With that, he walked away.
I stood up, staring at his back, downed the water, took a deep breath, and followed him into the music room.
As soon as we entered, he pressed me against the wall and kissed me.
Something cold touched my chest.
His tall figure loomed over me, firmly gripping my waist as he kissed me hard.
I don't know how long it lasted, but we were both breathless when Ethan finally let go.
In the dim room, I leaned against the door, looking up at him, breathing heavily.
"Really... waited for you..."
He looked down at me intently. "You knew I wasn't here."
I tilted my head, smiling ambiguously.
"I didn't do anything you wouldn't like with him."
Ethan's fingers twirled my curls, his eyes narrowing slightly, his thin lips moving.
"You're so bad."
Yes, I am bad.
Giving him a little favoritism, but without any commitment.
Pure teasing.
I reached out to touch his head.
Ethan smiled, leaning forward to bury his face in my neck.
Just as I was happily petting him, someone started banging on the door.
"Ethan, you and that... uh, what's her name again?"
"Get lost! Ethan, I heard the lady's here! Did you bring her in there? Open up! Open the door!"
