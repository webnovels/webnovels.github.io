Lucas was back.
Ethan raised his head, his expression cold, his eyes darkening.
He used his fingertip to wipe my lips, about to open the door.
I grabbed his hand, tilting my chin down, lowering my eyes to indicate.
"Your glasses."
Ethan glanced down, his breathing slightly unsteady.
He looked away, slowly reaching in to grab his thin-framed glasses, quickly turning around.
I pressed my hand to my chest, smiling ambiguously at him. He was so bold putting them in, but now he's shy taking them out...
"Damn it, open up or I'll kick the door down!"
The door opened.
Ethan's expression was back to normal. "We were trying out the piano."
Zack held Lucas back. "I told you Ethan wouldn't betray us!"
Lucas lowered his raised foot and walked up to us, scrutinizing every detail.
"Trying the piano? Or trying each other?" He suddenly leaned in close, staring at me intently, gritting his teeth. "Her lipstick's all gone, you've practically kissed her bare-faced!"
Bare-faced?
My full makeup!
I covered my face with my hands. Ethan pulled me behind him.
"Lucas, you're scaring her."
Lucas glared at him hatefully. "We agreed to resist together. What do you call this? Do you know what you're doing?" He pulled Zack over. "Tell me, does kissing count as resisting?"
Ethan stared at Zack.
Zack stared at Ethan.
I peeked out from behind, also staring at Zack.
Lucas urged, "Say something, bro!"
Zack stammered, "I guess it counts."
Lucas stumbled back two steps.
"How can that count?" His brain seemed to be racing, finally reaching a blank state. "Then what are we resisting?"
Ethan offered to take me home, but Lucas said he wanted to.
"You taking her is like a fox guarding the henhouse. What's the difference?"
I raised my hand, weakly interjecting. "The difference is, I'm not a chicken?"
Lucas turned to me, clasping his hands together, apologizing frantically.
"I'm sorry, beautiful. I didn't mean to insult you. It's just that he can't take you!"
Ethan pressed his lips together, sighing. "Then how are you any different from me?"
Lucas told me to choose one person to take me home.
I looked at Ethan - I liked him but couldn't pin him down. Then I looked at Lucas - I could handle him but...
"I choose Zack."
Zack, observing from a distance, widened his eyes, doubting his hearing. "Me?"
Lucas looked at me, about to say something.
Ethan covered his mouth from behind, tilting his head to give me a faint smile. "Then let him take you."
I followed him downstairs.
Zack told me to wait by the road.
I waited in the wind for a long time before the disguised Zack arrived at lightning speed.
I was silent for a minute, utterly dumbfounded.
"What the hell! You're taking me on a motorcycle?!"
In the dark night, Zack took off his helmet, revealing sharp features, looking at me lazily.
"Miss, this is a superbike. Very expensive."
My face turned black as night.
Zack tossed me a helmet, resting his elbow on the bike, his tone extremely impatient.
"Hey, are you getting on or not? You're the one who insisted I take you!"
I held the heavy helmet, looking at him with a complicated expression, but still voiced my concern.
"Can we take the bike lane?"
Zack was silent for a moment. "Have you asked the people in the bike lane?"
I guess not. I swung my leg over, resigned to my fate. But my skirt wasn't long enough, exposing a long stretch of leg.
Zack looked back at me, the corner of his mouth curling up, his tone provocative.
"Wow! If you don't cover those legs, we'll cause a pile-up on the road."
He produced a jacket from somewhere and had me tie it around my waist.
Zack helped me put on the helmet, raising an eyebrow slightly as he tapped the top.
"Hold on tight later! This has nothing to do with the bet, got it?"
I looked at him through the helmet, thinking I'd call the police.
I leaned forward, putting my arms around his waist. Midway, my foot slipped and I wobbled.
Zack looked back down, his tone serious. "Take off your shoes."
I took off my high heels, holding them in my hand, looking around. "But where do I put them?"
"Give them to me."
Zack unzipped his jacket, took my heels, and tucked them inside, zipping back up.
I was stunned for a moment, then put my arms around his waist, thinking this rich boy was quite practical.
I recognized Zack's bike - it cost over a million.
But there were plenty of rich kids at the music school, so it wasn't that surprising.
When Lucas was busking in the underground passage, he sang with an air that said he didn't need money, which is why I deliberately tossed him a dollar.
Not to mention Ethan's top-tier aura - just talking to him made my body tingle.
Zack looked straight ahead, lowering his helmet visor, the corner of his mouth curling slightly.
"Let's go."
In an instant, the engine roared to life.
He was going too fast!
The wind whistled in my ears. I clung tightly to Zack's back, clearly feeling the young man's spine. I couldn't help but lower my head, tightening my arms around him, my heart in my throat.
If I had a life bar above my head, it would probably be flickering by now.
At several red lights, I crashed into his back.
Zack glanced back at me. "Tsk."
Me: "..."
