He'd suffered enough, time to give him a taste of sweetness.
I had a surprise planned for Lucas.
My new music store was deliberately opened near his school.
To maintain my air of mystery, I'd never told Lucas what I did for work.
The identity of a music store owner should impress him.
I told him I'd see him today.
The new store was busy with students and teachers on opening day. I might run into Lucas by chance.
Suddenly I overheard three guys talking.
"You still haven't sealed the deal with that dollar-tipping cougar?"
"The bet ends in three days. Loser pays five grand!"
"Screw off. That old lady? I could have her eating out of my hand in no time."
That deep, magnetic voice was unmistakable.
Lucas walked in with two other guys.
The three of them had their arms around each other's shoulders - clearly close friends. They were all pretty handsome.
Lucas had the purest, most innocent face. The one who called me "dollar-tipping cougar" looked a bit wilder.
The last one wore glasses and had a calm, studious look, like he stepped out of an anime.
Birds of a feather flock together, I suppose. Handsome guys stick together.
"Who was it that said they could seal the deal in three months?"
"Buy me a piano and we'll call it even."
Lucas smirked, waving his phone at them.
"See this? I get mad once, and she's coming to find me!"
I hadn't expected Lucas to have this side to him.
I thought he was an innocent puppy, but turns out he's a sly dog.
Making bets about sleeping with me in three months?
What a nasty game.
But I... kind of like these kinds of bets.
I bet I could sleep with all three of them in one month.
