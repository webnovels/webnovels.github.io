Ethan and I snapped back to reality.
He let go of me.
Looking down, he started buttoning up his messy white shirt.
Lucas's eyes were red with anger as he rushed over and punched Ethan.
"Have you no fucking shame?!"
Ethan's lip started bleeding from the punch, but he didn't fight back.
He stood firm, slowly raising his eyes to stare at Lucas. His voice was muffled: "She's not your girlfriend."
Lucas was taken aback.
It's true that we weren't officially dating.
But it still felt like Ethan was in the wrong here.
"I met her first! I introduced her to you, and then I get abandoned at the movies while you're here making out with her! Fuck, I'm gonna beat you to death!"
Zack wrapped his arms around the enraged Lucas.
"Lucas, calm down! Ethan's our bro, I'm sure he didn't mean to!"
Lucas turned to look at him in shock.
"Are you fucking kidding me? How can this be an accident?! What kind of bro kisses his friend's date?"
Zack fell silent for a moment.
There was also him.
He had kissed her too.
I turned to leave.
Lucas immediately pushed Zack away and grabbed my wrist.
"Don't go! Where are you going? Didn't you come to see me today?"
I was quiet for a moment, then opened my palm. "I'm going to wash my hands. I just touched..."
I trailed off suggestively.
Lucas took a second to process, then let go of my hand in disgust.
He turned to glare at Ethan, gritting his teeth. "You... fucking... bastard!"
Zack looked at Ethan too, his face twisted in pain.
"Ethan! What's wrong with you? Are you sick?"
Ethan's expression remained calm. "I have my advantages."
Zack didn't understand. "What fucking advantages?"
He turned around to find Lucas looking for something to hit Ethan with.
"Being shameless, that's what!"
Lucas actually found a stick.
He raised it high.
I rushed over to shield Ethan.
"That's enough. This has nothing to do with him."
Lucas met my eyes for a moment, then lowered the stick, looking rather hurt.
"I wouldn't let you touch me, so you came back to touch him? He's so easy, and you're still protecting him?"
Ethan frowned. "You wanted to touch him too?"
I stayed silent.
Zack took two steps back, glanced at me, and quietly covered himself.
Lucas turned on Ethan again.
"You dare speak? Who the fuck do you think you are? Homewrecker!"
Ethan coldly repeated: "She's not your girlfriend. We should compete fairly."
Lucas laughed bitterly.
"Compete with what? If Zack and I had come a bit later, you'd have your pants off already. I'll fucking compete with your..."
He got angrier as he spoke, picking up the stick again. "I'm gonna kill you today!"
Zack went to hold him back again.
"Enough! Lucas, Ethan was tricked by this woman! I can testify, she was hitting on Ethan earlier when you were still here."
I narrowed my eyes at Zack.

How dare he betray me.
He's dead meat now.
Lucas froze in disbelief. "So before I even turned you down, you were already into him?"
I sat down calmly.
"Because I overheard."
I looked Lucas in the eye.
"You made a bet about me. Betting you could sleep with me in three months, for five grand."
All three of their expressions soured.
"Lucas, you've already lost that bet."
I kept smiling.
"But I'll add five grand and bet I can sleep with all three of you in one month."
Ethan's face instantly turned cold.
Lucas pressed his lips together tightly. "How can you bet on something like that?"
I leaned forward, raising an eyebrow slightly.
"Why not? If you guys can do it, why can't I?"
Only Zack walked over to Lucas, confidently putting a hand on his shoulder.
"Take the bet! What are we afraid of? We'll definitely win! I don't believe it - go ahead, try and force yourself on me!"
Lucas glanced at Ethan, sighed, then turned to look at Zack.
"Bro, are you sure you can handle it?"
Zack leaned forward, meeting my eyes.
He pointed one finger at his crotch.
"Let me tell you, if I can't keep this under control, I'll fucking cut it off myself!"
Lucas was startled. "Bro, you don't need to..."
I immediately stood up, smiling with curved eyes.
"Perfect! It's settled then! Ten grand, plus your... trophy."
Zack quietly pulled the other two in front of him.
"Protect me."
He looked at Lucas and Ethan again.
"Never mind, I'll have to protect myself."
