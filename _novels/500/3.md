Zack finally snapped out of it, prying my arms off. There was still lipstick on his lips.
"You!" He was furious.
I patted his cheek. "Keep it a secret, okay?"
Zack's Adam's apple bobbed as he breathed rapidly.
His face was so hot.
Lucas quickly came over. "Why are you all gathered here?"
Zack looked strange and didn't dare speak.
I obediently walked to Lucas's side, glancing at Ethan.
"Ethan came to apologize, right?"
Ethan pressed his lips together and gave a slight nod.
But his expression was clearly unhappy, especially when looking at Zack.

Big bro not only did something bad in secret, but made me cover for him.
Lucas glanced at Zack. "You've got lipstick on your mouth."
Panic flashed in Zack's eyes for a moment. "Uh, I put on makeup before going out today."
Lucas frowned but didn't say anything more.
The three chose a piano, with Ethan as the buyer.
I kept his contact information.
Lucas and I went to see a movie.
In the flickering light of the big screen, he secretly took my hand, his palm slightly sweaty.
"Your hand is so soft."
I turned to look at him.
In the dim light, his delicate features were even more captivating.
He really was my type.
I leaned close to his ear and whispered, "I want to feel your abs."
Lucas hesitated, biting his lip. "We're in public."
I pulled my hand back, losing interest.
Halfway through the movie, I went to the bathroom and texted him saying I had an emergency and had to leave.
When Lucas chased after me, I was already in the elevator.
Back at the store, my phone kept ringing.
"You left just because I wouldn't let you touch me?"
"You've got some nerve!"
"I only said we were in public, not that I wouldn't let you..."
"Beautiful, can you give me another chance?"
"...I'll do whatever you want."
The long fingers that had been playing the piano stopped.
"Aren't you going to reply to him?" Ethan's lashes were long.
I bent down to look at him.
"No need. I'd rather hear you play."
Asking for something likely to be refused is the best way to escape.
I left the theater and called Ethan, telling him the piano they bought earlier had a defect and needed to be exchanged.
"But I'm fighting with Lucas and don't really want to see Zack either. Can you come alone?"
Ethan hesitated for a moment. "Alright."
I took him to the second floor of the music store.
It was quieter up here, better for getting closer.
The piano music slowly faded.
I sat down next to him, casually pressing some keys.
"About earlier, Zack came looking for me."
Ethan stood up. "That has nothing to do with me."
I grabbed his wrist.
"It does. I said one thing to you, and he said I was hitting on you and threatened to tell Lucas. I was worried it would affect you, so I kissed him." I let go of him. "If you don't believe me, ask Zack."
Ethan called Zack.
It was pretty much as I'd said, except Zack claimed I kissed him first.
Zack also quietly asked a favor: "Ethan, don't tell Lucas about this. He's really into that woman right now."
"Got it."
"By the way, when are you coming back to the dorm? Lucas is back and going crazy again."
"I'm tutoring off campus."
Ethan hung up and looked at me coldly.
I pressed my lips together, my eyes full of grievance.
"Of course he'd say that. He forced me to kiss him. And is complimenting your piano playing really hitting on you?"
Ethan stared at me steadily, his voice flat: "Yes, it is."
I was stunned.
