Ethan sat down next to me.
His long fingers covered my hand, gently pressing down on the piano keys, producing a monotonous sound.
"I know you're trying to seduce me."
Ethan turned to face me, his expression blank.
"Not just earlier, but now too."
Meeting his cold eyes behind those thin glasses, my palms started sweating nervously.
Apparently the ones who seem the most well-behaved and innocent are actually the most dangerous to mess with.
I unconsciously leaned away.
Ethan lowered his gaze slightly, noticing this. The corners of his lips curved into a barely perceptible smile.
He suddenly grabbed my waist firmly, pulling me onto him, and stared intently at me.
"So, why did you kiss Zack if you were trying to seduce me?"
My mind was in chaos, thoughts racing, but I still told the truth.
"I just didn't want him to tell Lucas."
Ethan calmly accepted this explanation.
He leaned in closer, his breath falling on my face.
"Stop playing with Lucas. Play with me instead." He slowly moved to my ear. "I'm more fun than he is."
Ethan was telling the truth - he was way more fun than Lucas.
Right there on that piano, he kissed me breathless. My hands wandered who knows where, our breathing getting heavier and heavier.
"Mmm..."
A seductive sound escaped Ethan's throat.
Like a kitten purring, enticing you to pet its head.
My phone suddenly rang.
I glanced at it - Lucas was calling. I didn't answer.
Ethan saw and reached over to hang up.
But Lucas kept calling. After a while we just ignored it, only focused on kissing.
Ethan pulled me onto his lap to kiss me. We were lost in it, completely absorbed.
Suddenly an angry voice thundered from the doorway.
"What the fuck?! Ethan, is this your fucking tutoring session?!"
Lucas kicked the door open.
Zack's voice followed right after.
"Lucas, calm down... Holy shit! Ethan, you dog!"
