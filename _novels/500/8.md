But whether I could win this bet depended on the most unwilling of the three.
Besides Lucas, Ethan and Zack were both reluctant, especially Zack. He had bet everything, so there was no way he'd agree.
I had to dispel his wariness.
If I managed to get Lucas, Zack would definitely panic.
So I needed to make him feel safe.
I had a staff member call Ethan.
"Hello, the piano you ordered is packaged. Shall we have it delivered?"
Ethan gave the address.
"We'll need someone to sign for it. Are you home now?"
Ethan's voice was gentle and pure.
"I'm not, but someone's there. I'll have them sign for it."
After hanging up, I got the address and went to deliver the piano.
Zack and the others weren't living in the school dorms, but renting a large apartment off campus.
I rang the doorbell.
The door opened to reveal Zack, shirtless and wearing only boxers.
Wow, what a great body.
My eyes widened involuntarily.
Zack had a toothbrush in his mouth. Seeing me, he cursed and slammed the door shut!
When he opened it again, he had put on a shirt and sweatpants, arms crossed as he looked at me.
"Damn, you really dared to come here? I'm not like those two, acting like they've never seen a woman before! Please leave! I'm very sorry for any loneliness I may have caused you."
He finally finished speaking.
I stepped aside, gesturing behind me.
"I'm here to deliver the piano. Didn't Ethan tell you?"
Zack finally noticed the delivery men waiting silently behind me.
He was stunned. "He did."
Stepping inside, the view opened up immensely. A river view stretched before us, the decor exuding luxury.
They had an enormous music room with special soundproofing. There were quite a few instruments - guitars, violins, cellos, drums, and a piano...
"You already have a piano, why buy another?"
"That's Ethan's old one, he wanted to buy..." He turned to look at me. "None of your business! Why so many questions!"
The piano was set up.
Zack dragged me out. "Go, go, get out!"
Everyone else left, but I sat on the living room couch. Zack kept his distance from me.
"Why aren't you leaving?"
"Ethan told me to wait for him."
I leaned back comfortably.
Zack's eyes were highly alert and full of confusion. "What does he want you to wait for?"
I propped my chin on my hand, winking at him. "Maybe you know."
Zack was stunned for a moment. When he realized, his face contorted.
"Ah— Ethan's not that kind of person! You seduced him onto the wrong path! You shameless woman!"
With that, Zack really ran away.
The sound of him locking his door was clearly audible.
As if I could really do anything to him.
Thirty minutes later, I knocked on Zack's door.
He only opened a crack, taking off his headphones.
"What? Is Ethan back?"
I smiled, holding up the takeout in my hand. "You haven't had breakfast, right?"
Zack looked down, swallowing.
"Not hungry."
He was about to close the door, but I quickly grabbed the edge.
"Don't be like that. Take it in and eat, I won't come in."
Zack stared at me, his tone hesitant. "You're so insistent. Did you drug it?"
I was speechless.
No wonder he's single.
"No drugs. Just rice porridge and shrimp dumplings."
I went back to the living room to play on my phone.
The takeout I'd left at the door was pulled inside by a hand.
Not long after, Zack came out.
"How much? I'll transfer you the money."
I didn't look up. "No need. Consider it payment for that kiss."
Zack's voice came from above, suppressing anger.
"My first kiss was only worth a breakfast?"
