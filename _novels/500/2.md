The three of them were eyeing a piano.
Lucas stood by it, pressing a few keys with one hand while texting me with the other.
"How's this sound? I'm at a music store. When are you coming to see me? I'll play for you when we meet."
"On my way," I replied.
Lucas's lips curled into a smile.
"She's really coming to find me! Hurry up and buy if you're buying, don't keep me waiting."
The three suddenly became very efficient, quickly asking about the price.
"Boss, how much is this one?"
I went over to help them personally.
When I appeared, their expressions all changed.
Lucas froze, looking uneasy.
The wilder-looking one leaning against the piano subconsciously adjusted his posture.
Even the one sitting at the piano looked startled for a moment before standing up.
I maintained a gentle smile.
"Hello, I'm the owner. Would you like me to introduce this piano?"
I spoke confidently, exuding charm.
Lucas stared at me the whole time.
When I finished, Lucas nervously opened his mouth: "Beautiful, when did you get here?"
The other two exchanged glances, realizing who I was.
"Just arrived. Didn't you say you'd play for me when we met?"
I didn't expose him.
Because the game had to go on.
Lucas played the piano nearby.
I brought glasses of water to the other two guys. The wild one was called Zack, the studious one Ethan.
As I handed the glass to Ethan, I deliberately let our fingers touch, leaning close to his ear.
"You played better than him earlier."
Ethan glanced at me and pulled his hand back: "You..."
The paper cup suddenly fell to the ground, spilling water all over my dress.
The music stopped.
Lucas had been watching us closely and stood up to look at Ethan.
"What are you doing? Can't even hold a cup steady?"
Ethan hesitated without speaking.
I smiled. "It's fine."
I went to the bathroom to clean up. As I came out, I ran into the troublemaker.
"I saw everything. You were hitting on Ethan."
I smiled at him. "I wasn't."
One sentence hardly counts as flirting, does it?
Zack put his hands in his pockets and smirked, looking a bit roguish.
"I wasn't going to get involved! But Lucas and Ethan are my bros. What if you mess things up between us?"
It seemed Zack was the leader of the three, Ethan the youngest, which made Lucas the middle one.
Zack stepped closer, lowering his head: "If you keep hitting on Ethan, I'll tell Lucas."
I looked up at him, almost touching his nose, my voice lilting.
"So if I hit on you instead, would you tell?"
Before he could react, I grabbed his neck and kissed him.
It all happened so suddenly.
Zack was stunned as I pushed him against the wall. He stared down at me, forgetting to push me away.
Until Ethan's cool voice came from nearby.
"Zack, what are you two doing?"
