Five years ago, I lost my memory in a car accident. Lucas Lin told me he was my lover.

He saved me, took care of me, and we naturally got married.

For five years, I devoted myself to him, taking care of his every need. I thought I was the happiest wife in the world.

But when I was about to tidy up the study, I overheard a conversation between Lucas and his childhood sweetheart.

"Lucas, Aria has been so dedicated to you these past five years. She practically waits on you hand and foot! I'm getting jealous~"

Lucas fondly stroked her head, "Silly girl, all that menial work is what she's supposed to do. I'd never let you do such things."

Furious, I pushed open the door and accused Yvette of being a homewrecker.

To my shock, she produced a marriage certificate with Lucas, claiming I was the one intruding on their relationship.

In the ensuing scuffle, I hit my head on the bookshelf and regained my memory.

It turned out I was actually the heiress of the wealthiest family in town!

Looking at Lucas, who was still berating me, and the sniffling Yvette in his arms, I turned and dialed my bodyguard's number: "Ethan, your young miss has been bullied!"
