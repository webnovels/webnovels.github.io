My sister is the vicious female antagonist.

My brother is the crazy villain.

I am the sweet and innocent girl raised by them, one hand each.

At a party, my sister was leading her group of mean girls to tear into the heroine.

I barged into the hall carrying my backpack.

I slapped my failed math test paper into her arms: "Sis, the teacher wants you to go to school."

The malicious smile on my sister's face couldn't hold.

Pinching my test paper, she broke down: "This is the ninth time this month you've been called for a parent-teacher meeting!"

In business negotiations, my brother was ambitious and ruthless.

He was about to casually sign an unfair contract to swallow the male lead's industry.

I pushed open the door of the lounge and came out, handing the game console to my brother.

Ignoring the tense atmosphere in the entire conference room, I said: "I can't pass this level again, bro, you help me beat this level first."

My brother lifted me onto his lap with one hand, sighed helplessly while holding me: "Baby, this game doesn't suit you."

He said: "Bro will acquire a new game company tomorrow, specifically to make games for you to play."

1

Since I became conscious.

I knew I lived in a world of torturous romance revolving around the male and female leads.

But unfortunately.

I wasn't born well.

Less than half a year after I was born.

My parents both died tragically.

I was raised by my brother and sister.

When I was ten years old and literate.

I learned that the sister who went crazy every day tutoring me with my homework.

Was the primary vicious female antagonist in this world.

And the brother who indulged and spoiled me without any bottom line.

Was the biggest villain boss in this world.

2

The male and female leads are the center of the world.

Anything against the male and female leads is doomed to have no good end.

My 10th birthday was spent with my brother and sister.

When making a birthday wish.

I looked at my gentle and beautiful sister on the left, and then at my young and handsome brother on the right.

They surrounded me holding the cake.

In their eyes, there was only me.

No matter how vicious and ruthless my brother and sister were outside.

But in front of me, they were the people who loved me most in this world.

—I don't want them to meet their destined tragic ending.

I want to do my best.

To save them.

3

But I am really stupid.

It seems like mom and dad gave all the IQ to my brother and sister.

My brother created his own business empire at a young age.

Solved the family's financial problems.

Also provided us with a superior life.

My sister is especially good at winning people's hearts.

She has a beautiful and bright face.

From childhood to adulthood, suitors have been endless, and she is always surrounded by groups of men and women rushing towards her.

But the pity is.

My brother fell for the heroine who doesn't belong to him.

My sister fell for the hero who doesn't belong to her.

4

I sat in the passenger seat of my sister's supercar, propping my face and sighing.

My sister was driving and still raised her hand to rub my hair messily.

"What's wrong again? Didn't understand math class again?"

I turned helplessly to look at my sister: "Ethan Stone isn't even as handsome as my brother, nor as rich as you, what exactly do you see in him?"

Ethan Stone is the destined male lead of this world.

My sister heard me mention his name.

Raised her eyebrows slightly, pinched my face: "Actually worrying about my affairs?"

She said: "You take care of your own studies first."

"How many times have I gone to parent-teacher meetings for you, lost face so many times, and got scolded by your teachers so many times."

5

After speaking, she didn't even give me a chance to protest.

Directly turned the car around: "I have something to do tonight, can't accompany you with homework."

She said: "I'll drop you off at brother's company."

I lowered my eyes and hugged my backpack tightly.

—I know what she's going to do tonight.

She has many fox friends and dog friends (bad friends), and easily knew the heroine's movements as soon as she returned to the country.

The white moonlight heroine returned to the country.

My sister is going to give someone a display of power tonight.

I propped my chin and sighed heavily again.

The supercar made a smooth U-turn and had already stopped downstairs at my brother's company.

6

My sister got out of the car and opened the passenger door, seeing me sitting motionless in the passenger seat, she bent down and smiled at me.

"What are you dazing for?" She scratched my chin.

Pulled my hand to get me out of the car, and put the backpack on my back.

"Let's go, I'll walk you upstairs." She held my shoulders.

I paused, said I could find the way myself.

"You go," I looked up at the red suspender long dress on my sister.

Such a beautiful person, why did she fall for Ethan Stone.

My sister was indeed in a hurry, picking me up from school and sending me here, it was already getting dark.

She tidied my wrinkled collar again.

Instructed uneasily: "Then I'm leaving, go up quickly to find brother, let him order food for you."

I hummed, standing in place watching her look back every three steps until she finally drove away.

As soon as her car drove out of the end of this road.

I immediately hailed a taxi and told the driver to follow the car in front.

7

When the taxi carried me away from downstairs of the company.

Through the window, I actually saw my brother lazily carrying his suit jacket, coming out from the entrance.

Behind him followed several assistants in suits running in small steps.

The assistants bowed and scraped behind him.

And my brother's face was cold and stern, brows sharp.

Naturally having an aura of strangers keep away.

He was really sensitive, perhaps sensing my scrutinizing gaze.

Actually about to look up towards me.

I immediately lowered my upper body, hiding under the window.

At the same time, the phone vibrated lightly in my arms.

It was a message from my brother: Baby, where are you guys?

Followed by another one: What do you want to eat tonight?

Seems my sister told him in advance about dropping me off.

I turned off the phone, pretended not to see.

Now, I have to find my sister first.

8

My sister's driving was taught by my brother personally.

At 17 or 18, my brother was a regular on the race track.

When they weren't carrying me, they drove with a desperate madness.

So even if I urged the taxi driver to chase closely.

Also easily thrown off by my sister's supercar.

When I arrived at the star hotel in the city center, the lights inside were bright, it had already started.

The security guard at the door stopped me outside.

Said I didn't have an invitation, wouldn't let me in.

I was afraid my sister was already bullying the heroine inside.

Really no choice.

I could only bring out my brother.

Fortunately, my brother often instilled in me the domineering concept that I could walk sideways in the city.

Fortunately, my brother also had shares in this hotel.

After bringing out my brother, the manager came out specially.

He wiped the sweat from his forehead and welcomed me respectfully.

But I really had no leisure to deal with him.

Carrying my backpack into the hall, I started tiptoeing to find my sister.

No way, even for height, I failed to inherit my parents' genes.

My brother's height is approaching 6'3" (190cm), my sister was already 5'9" (175cm) when she just became an adult.

And me, still not even 5'5" (165cm) yet.

9

Where my sister is, is always the center of the crowd.

So I scanned the hall.

And saw the group of people at the railing on the second floor.

My sister in a gorgeous red dress, stepping on stilettos, holding a red wine glass, a cigarette between her fingers.

Leaning lazily on the railing.

And around her, squeezed a group of men and women.

Surrounded in the very center, was a young girl wearing plain white clothes with delicate features.

Looking at that temperament.

I determined almost at a glance, that was the heroine.

I dared not stop, ran up the stairs taking two steps at a time.

The closer I got to that place, the more I could hear their mockery and ridicule.

And although my sister didn't speak, the corners of her mouth hooked a malicious smile.

Really a vivid image of a domineering villainess.

I rushed over, before standing firm, pulled out the failed math test paper from my bag and slapped it on my sister's chest.

"—Sis," I called her breathlessly.

My sister was startled by me.

She didn't hold the wine glass steady, dropped it on the ground.

But her reaction was also fast.

Almost the moment the wine glass landed, she lifted me by the armpits and hugged me.

Avoided the broken glass on the ground.

I hugged her neck smoothly, wrapped around her waist, leaning on her.

In front of all the young men and women present, said loudly: "Sis, the teacher wants you to go to school."
