Aria's life takes an unexpected turn when her twin sister Luna marries into wealth and they both become pregnant at the same time. But when Luna gives birth to a daughter with a congenital heart defect, she secretly switches the babies. Years later, Luna's daughter grows up to be spoiled and unsuccessful, while the child Aria raised excels in both academics and career. As Aria travels the world and enjoys a fulfilling life, Luna's jealousy reaches a boiling point. It's only then that Aria discovers the truth about the baby switch.

Before Aria can explain, Luna, driven mad with envy, stabs her through the heart. When Aria opens her eyes again, they've both returned to the day the children were born. This time, Luna fiercely guards her own daughter, refusing to let anyone near her.

Aria can only smile coldly. Little does Luna know that in the previous life, her daughter had died of heart failure at just ten years old...
