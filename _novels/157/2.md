From a young age, I was always well-behaved and obedient.

As a daughter, I was filial and never defied my elders.

But Adam had been spoiled rotten since childhood, leaving a trail of broken hearts.

After marrying into the Thompson family, I treated Adam as my whole world. I never went against his wishes.

To satisfy his possessive nature, I would bundle up in layers even on the hottest summer days before going out.

So no one believed the adult video I showed Adam was real.

They also didn't believe an ordinary video could kill a man who loved money more than life itself.

But only I knew - it was all true.

I just had no idea how this video could kill someone.

For the next three years, Adam's family still refused to give up on sending me to prison.

They went from causing a scene at my door every day, to falling into despair after the police cleared me of suspicion.

They finally accepted the reality that Adam had committed suicide.

As for me, within a year of moving back to my old neighborhood, I reunited with my childhood friend Jack, who was now the heir to a business empire. We soon began dating.

Three days before our wedding, Jack held me tightly and said,

"Lily, I'm finally marrying you. I've waited 23 years for this day."

"I'll make you the happiest woman in the world. I won't be like your ex-husband at all."

He rested his chin on my shoulder.

"If you ask me, your ex must have been fated to die young. A video killing someone? I don't buy it! Those people will believe any rumor. How could they actually think a video can kill?"

He paused, then took my hand and said,

"But I have to admit, I'm quite curious too. Is there really something scandalous in that video?"

He looked at me cautiously.

"Don't be angry. I'm not blaming you for making that kind of video. I just thought if I watched it, I could help prove the truth."

Jack's eyes were full of concern. He always believed in me unconditionally like this.

"I don't know. But he really did die after watching the video," I said quietly.

"Don't overthink it. Adam must have offended someone powerful and that's why he died. You happened to show the video at that time, so those people used it as an excuse to avoid suspicion," Jack reassured me.

I asked worriedly, "But what if you watch it and end up dying like Adam? What would I do then?"

"Marrying you is the luckiest thing to ever happen to me. Even if I die, I have no regrets," Jack said with a bright smile.

I angrily covered his mouth with my hand to stop him from saying such ominous things.

After his repeated pleading, I finally nodded in agreement.

"But I have one condition - you can't watch the video alone."

Jack hugged me gently. "As you wish. I'll watch it at our wedding then."
