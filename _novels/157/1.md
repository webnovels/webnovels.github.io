My husband Adam was notorious for being a penny-pincher. He wouldn't let anyone touch his safe.

But more than money, he valued his own life above all else.

This was a man who would call the doctor for a full checkup over a simple sneeze.

Yet after I showed him that video, he not only transferred all his assets to me, but even took his own life.

The day after Adam's death was confirmed, this incident blew up on social media and became a trending topic.

"Adam Thompson was known to be extremely frugal. How could he possibly be willing to give up everything?"

"Just confess and you'll be treated leniently. Think carefully before you speak," the young detective said sternly. He stared intently at my face, trying to warn me not to cover up the truth.

I waved my hands anxiously. "I really don't know, officer. Maybe he felt guilty about how he treated me and wanted to make amends?"

I explained the whole sequence of events to them in detail - from Adam auctioning off my private photos with his mistress at an exhibition, to me showing him the video and watching him kneel and beg for divorce.

"Impossible. From what we've learned, Adam wouldn't even pay for groceries out of his own pocket," the female officer beside him said with a grim expression. She glanced at a file and continued, "He even made the girls he cheated with pay for the hotel rooms and condoms."

"What exactly did you show him?" she demanded.

"It really was just an adult video starring me, officer," I said. I knew every word I spoke was the truth.

Unable to get any useful information from me, the police had no choice but to end their interrogation.

I returned to my apartment complex.

As soon as I stepped out of the elevator, I found a crowd of reporters already gathered outside my door.

"Ms. Brooks, your husband auctioned off your private photos for profit. Don't you hate him for that?"

"He didn't do anything worth hating. And I really don't know why he died," I replied.

Hearing my response, they exchanged excited glances and shoved their microphones closer.

"Please tell us, what exactly was in that video?"

"What was your purpose in showing the video? Are you sure Adam's death had nothing to do with you?"

"I really don't know anything!" I cried, trying to dodge their cameras.

But they wouldn't listen and only grew more frenzied.

The property management soon heard the commotion and came with some neighbors to drive the reporters away from my door.

Just as I breathed a sigh of relief, Adam's family angrily rushed up to confront me.

"Lily Brooks, you killed my son and took all his money. You must pay for his life with your own!" Adam's mother screamed.

"What nonsense are you spouting? Lily's been a good girl since she was little. She wouldn't even hurt an ant, how could she possibly kill someone?"

"If you ask me, it must be your son who offended the wrong person!"

I didn't say a word as the older ladies drove Adam's family away with their scolding.

No one would believe that I had killed Adam Thompson.

Even I myself didn't understand why he committed suicide after watching that video.
