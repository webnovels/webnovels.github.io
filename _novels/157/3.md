At the wedding, countless guests stared at me curiously.

"Who would have thought? She lost her husband but managed to marry someone even better."

"I wouldn't dare marry a woman like that. Who knows when you might die mysteriously."

"It's been so long, but I still want to know what was in that video. I wonder if we'll get to see it today..."

Adam's parents had also been invited to attend my wedding.

They now looked pale and gaunt, their faces like sheets of paper. But their eyes still held traces of hatred when they looked at me.

I ignored it all.

I was only thinking about what was about to happen, feeling increasingly nervous.

Following the officiant's blessings, I lifted my dress and walked step by step to Jack's side.

"Now, the bride has a surprise for everyone," I said with a smile, handing the USB drive to Jack.

"That's right, as you've all guessed, this surprise is the mysterious video everyone's been so curious about."

As soon as I finished speaking, the crowd erupted in whispers.

Everyone's faces showed a mix of fear and excitement. No one dared to step forward.

Adam's parents' expressions became especially grim.

When they saw Jack about to open the file, they suddenly rushed onto the stage shouting,

"Don't watch it! You absolutely must not watch it, it will kill you!"

"She's the real murderer, arrest her quickly! Wasn't killing my son enough for you? Do you want to keep hurting more people?"

Adam's mother glared at me fiercely, her eyes filled with hatred like she wanted to devour me whole.

"I really don't know why he died. I didn't kill him!" I stepped forward hesitantly to explain, but Jack immediately shielded me.

He gave them an icy stare.

"This is the most important day for Lily and me. If you're here to cause trouble, please leave!"

Adam's mother kept shaking her head, insisting they couldn't watch it or someone would die.

His father pulled her arm, looking at me with grief-stricken eyes as he begged,

"Please Lily, don't hurt anyone else."

I frowned in confusion and asked, "What do you mean? Adam committed suicide. I've never hurt anyone."

Before I could finish, they both knelt before me, kowtowing repeatedly.

"Adam wronged you, but he didn't deserve to die! Please, the video absolutely cannot be shown!"

Suddenly, they stared at me in terror, collapsing to the ground. They grabbed Jack's pant leg, shaking their heads frantically.

"She's a demon! Lily Brooks is insane, you've all been fooled by her!"

"Her parents didn't even show up on her wedding day. When Adam married her, we never met her family."

"She's cursed! It wasn't enough to curse her parents to death, she had to kill our son too!"

The scene descended into chaos. Jack's expression darkened as he called security to remove them.

He took a deep breath, placing his hand back on the mouse.

Everyone pushed forward, both afraid yet curious to see.

I stood beside Jack and held his hand, nervously holding my breath.

"Maybe we shouldn't watch it, Jack."

He smiled at me. "It's fine, it's just a video."

But his hand was trembling slightly.

He swallowed hard and clicked the mouse.

After the video finished playing, Jack wiped the sweat from his brow.

"How was it, Mr. Evans? What was in the video?"

"Looks like there was nothing wrong with the video. Adam Thompson must have done something terrible to kill himself."

Some people tried to get closer to see the screen, but Jack quickly shut the laptop.

I had just started to relax when I noticed Jack, who had been smiling moments ago, was now frozen in place, staring at me wordlessly.

His hand had turned ice cold as he pulled away from me and jumped off the stage.
