On Mother's Day, my husband, who is the chief designer of extreme sports projects, was celebrating the completion of a new venture. His childhood friend, Emily, suggested I try the newly opened extreme zip line across the canyon to "bless the project with good fortune." Being nine months pregnant, I firmly declined for the safety of our child, but Emily only laughed.

"The new project is exceptionally safe. As Ethan's wife, you should support his career. If you refuse, aren't you undermining him?" Ethan, shockingly, agreed with her and dismissed my fears and pleas.

"The whole project is my design—it's absolutely safe. Think of it as a unique prenatal experience for our 'child.'" The stress from the extreme activity caused me to bleed. Emily dismissively remarked that I was merely on my period and at my age, it was disgraceful. While I hung suspended in agony, he was in the control room laughing and chatting with Emily. Eventually, I lost the child, and he lost his mind.
