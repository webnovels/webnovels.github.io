All my friends say Nolan loves me as if his life depended on it.
And it's true. He once took a knife for me.
He chose to marry me even after learning I couldn't have children, despite his family’s disapproval.
I thought he would love me forever.
Until just now, when I saw him at the hospital, gently carrying a woman into the maternity ward.
"Be careful, this is our first child."
