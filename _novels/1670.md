I'm the real daughter of the Harrison family. At my wedding, I was about to exchange rings with my fiancé Zachary.

That's when Clara—the wife of Zachary's late brother—burst through the doors, her clothes in complete disarray.

"Zachary, help me! Melody's uncle Shane assaulted me!"

"He mocked me for being the adopted daughter and said that since he raised the real daughter of the Harrison family, he's their benefactor—so I should sleep with him... I can't live like this anymore!"

The guests erupted in chaos. 

They cursed Shane as a perverted asshole and blamed me for bringing a monster into our family.

Zachary immediately took off his suit jacket and draped it over Clara's shoulders, his face full of concern.

Then he turned to me, his eyes cold as ice.

"Melody, bring Shane out here!"

"He needs to face punishment and cut off his own dick, or this wedding is over!"

Looking at the murderous expressions on my parents' faces and Zachary's parents, I almost laughed.

Because Shane didn't even have that thing.
