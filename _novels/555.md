My best friend, Isabelle, and I were unexpectedly transported to a post-apocalyptic world where women were incredibly scarce.

Here, the men gave us the best food and protected us with all their might.

Slowly, Isabelle grew reluctant to return to our original world.

"This," she'd say, "is paradise."

But watching the men who constantly guarded us, I felt a chilling fear instead.

I knew there was no such thing as kindness without reason.

The primal instinct of males, above all else, is reproduction.
