For ten years, my husband, Leo, was obsessed with "charity."

The first year, he offered late-night "psychological counseling" to a depressed female netizen, Skylar. Our SnapChat records showed 547 nude photos, all labeled as "Proof of Medical Improvement."

The second year, his infertile friend, Mike, begged him on his knees to "help his wife get pregnant." Leo personally stepped in and even recorded a video, archiving it as an "Excellent Genetic Donation."

The tenth year, on our wedding anniversary, a bombshell message blew up in his charity SnapChat group: "Eight months pregnant, urgently seeking a man to take over and give the baby a complete family!"

Leo immediately transferred $52,000 for prenatal care and charitable funds. His eyes red, he knelt on the ground, pleading with me, "Anya, I can't just stand by and watch that poor girl get torn apart by gossip! Let's get a temporary divorce for a year. Once the baby is born and settled, I'll come right back to you!"

This time, I didn't stop him. Feigning understanding, I agreed, "Fine. Coincidentally, I have a charity project of my own to do."
