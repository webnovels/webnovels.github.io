For the next few days, Landon truly seemed to have settled down, dutifully staying on campus.

Several times, I intentionally made movements to get close to him, just like before, and he surprisingly didn’t resist at all.

In fact, his reactions were quite intense.

The next time I evaded his pursuing lips, Landon finally couldn’t hold back. He forcefully pressed me down beneath him.

Panting, he commanded, “Open your mouth.”

“I’m a bit tired today.”

I innocently repeated his old excuse. “And a little unaccustomed to it.”

Landon’s breath hitched for a moment, and he slowly released me.

He lowered his gaze, muttering to himself, “It’s okay, after tonight…”

I didn’t know what he had planned.

But I tilted my head and thought.

Whether it was with Landon or Jasper, it was time for this game to end.

So I obediently nodded. “Okay.”
