“And you guys, don’t think I don’t know you’ve all been secretly eyeing Julian. Fine, crack all the jokes you want, but don’t you dare lay a hand on him. I’m not sharing my leftovers.”

“Hey, aren’t you almost done reeling in the campus queen? Why are you still playing Julian? Honestly, Julian’s pretty innocent; he just got turned gay by you because the campus queen likes you—”

“Who said he was turned gay by me?”

On the phone, Landon let out a short, lazy laugh.

“He secretly hid a photo under his pillow. He’d been crushing on me for ages.”

At the mention of the photo, my breathing hitched.

Then I heard him slowly utter the last few words: “He’s just inherently wired to be used by men.”

“Holy shit, Landon, you’re a legend!”

The call ended abruptly.

I gently exhaled.

That dull ache had long since passed, but there were always these tiny cuts.

Fine, fragmented, like ants gnawing at me.

…

I don’t know how long I’d stood outside in the breeze, but when Jasper wrapped his arms around me from behind, there wasn’t a trace of cigarette smoke left on him.

I instinctively melted into his embrace.

So, when he cupped my chin and kissed me, I mumbled in protest, “Landon…”

The hand exploring my waist paused, his voice husky. “Call me Husband.”

I squeezed my eyes shut, silently resisting.

Jasper didn’t get angry. He slowly lifted me.

My waist dipped into a breathtaking arch.

He coaxed softly, “Come on, call me Husband, okay?”

…

I finally couldn’t hold back a choked sob.

But the man behind me had already cast aside his gentle facade.

“Husband, Husband—!”

Remembering Jasper’s dominance, I quickly twisted around, rubbing my face against his hand.

Coaxing, “Husband, it hurts.”

“Hurts?”

The one who had been silent finally spoke. “Why didn’t you say so sooner?”

His long fingers brushed away the damp hair from my forehead. “Let Husband see.”

“…You’re really crying hard.”

His tone was loving, yet his gaze was clearly one of appreciation.

My limbs felt weak as I buried my face in his chest.

I couldn’t help but curse, “You jerk.”

“Jerk?” he repeated, then smiled meaningfully.

“You always did like jerks.”
