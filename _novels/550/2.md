Compared to Jasper, Landon really was more of a jerk.

I discovered this relationship was just a game of conquest.

It was the second week after we got together, when Landon took me to meet his friends.

Having crushed on him for two years, I knew he only liked girls before.

I was terrified his friends wouldn’t approve.

So, regardless of whether their intentions were malicious, or what kind of alcohol it was—red or white—

I accepted every drink they offered, pouring it all down my throat.

Finally, when I was too drunk to keep my eyes open, slumping softly into Landon’s arms, he finally spoke, lazily.

“Enough. Can’t you see he’s already passed out?”

“Tsk.”

Someone’s hand brushed my face. “Damn, that face is really something.”

Then a pinch on my waist. “Holy shit, his waist is tiny too.”

“If you don’t like guys, Landon, why don’t you give him to me?”

A puff of smoke was playfully blown into my face. “I love guys like this.”

What was he saying…?

I lay uncomfortably on Landon’s lap, coughing tears from the smoke.

“Oh, can’t stand smoke?”

The guy suddenly got excited. “Then imagine smoking while doing him—wouldn’t that be the best? Haha…”

What on earth were they talking about?!

My remaining consciousness waited for Landon to scold them.

But no matter how long I waited, he remained silent.

“So it’s settled.”

“Kyle, wanna join tonight? The hotel downstairs has everything, it’ll be epic…”

“Enough.”

Landon pushed the guy away, his voice low. “Don’t even think about him.”

“No way, Landon.”

The guy laughed exaggeratedly. “Do you want to taste what a guy feels like, or are you getting soft on him?”

“Come on, this is the guy the campus queen likes, he’s your rival. How can you be soft on him?”

“Damn it, are you deaf?”

Landon slammed his lighter on the table, his voice impatient.

“I told you I’d hand him over to my brother. Once I get Stella, I’ll just find an excuse to dump him. If I hand him over to you, you’ll try to kill him? I don’t want a murder on my hands.”

“As for getting soft,”

Landon sneered. “The thought of being intimate with a guy makes me sick.”

…No wonder.

No wonder every time I tried to kiss him, he’d turn away with a dark look.

I thought I was being too eager.

Turns out, he just found me disgusting.

…Good thing my face was down.

I struggled to keep from throwing up, trying to find some bitter amusement in the situation.

Otherwise, a grown man crying with snot and tears everywhere would look pretty bad, right?
