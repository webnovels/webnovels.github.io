After Swapping Bodies with My CEO Husband, I Blew $3 Million to Make My Favorite Actress a Star

She bashfully resisted yet yielded, coyly saying, "Mr. Mitchell, let's talk about this..."

At this critical moment, my CEO husband kicked open the door. Wearing my face, he exuded a chilling aura as he said, "You dare to cheat on me?"

I made my favorite actress a star.

That night, a photo of her gazing lovingly at business tycoon Lucas Mitchell on the awards stage went viral.

The media jumped on it, dubbing her the most likely celebrity to marry into wealth this year.

What they didn't know was that Lucas Mitchell was already married.

To me - Chloe Quinn, the controversial A-list actress with a less-than-stellar reputation.

A week ago, while getting my makeup done, the stylist accidentally knocked over some electrical equipment. I was electrocuted and passed out.

When I woke up, I found myself sitting in Lucas Mitchell's spacious office.

His secretary was asking with her head lowered, "Which of these candidates do you want as our brand ambassador?"

I immediately spotted my favorite - Zoe Young. Without hesitation, I pointed and said, "It has to be her."

The secretary then asked, "What's the budget?"

"The more the better."

The company executives tacitly agreed and poured $3 million into promoting her.

Now, she was famous. And the rumors were flying.

I had been hiding out for three days, not daring to go home.

At that moment, "Chloe Quinn" popped up on my phone screen. The vibration felt like a knife hanging over my head.

I nervously answered the call.

My own icy voice came through the speaker: "You have 30 minutes to get back here."

How is it that when Lucas Mitchell uses my body to speak, he can make even a woman's voice sound so chilling?

To be honest, Lucas Mitchell had always been quite cold towards me.

My best friend once analyzed the reason: "Lucas Mitchell comes from an elite family with a strict upbringing. Your face, on the other hand, doesn't exactly scream 'proper lady'."

"?"

She continued, "You look like a seductive vixen who could suck the life out of men."

I admit, at first I didn't have pure intentions about marrying him either.

It was my entertainment company's CEO who gave me the idea.

He said Lucas Mitchell was our company's arch-nemesis and told me to seduce him. If I succeeded, our company would become the industry leader, and I'd be their top star.

But on the day we planned to execute this scheme, something went wrong and I ended up getting drunk.

I woke up sprawled on top of Lucas Mitchell in a compromising position, caught red-handed by his mother.

So Lucas Mitchell had no choice but to marry me.

He probably didn't like me much either. Bound by his upbringing, he married an embarrassing trophy wife and left me to fend for myself in the entertainment industry.

My CEO told me to hang in there, and when the time was right, he'd rescue me.

I waited for three years, relying on controversy to become an A-list actress, but still couldn't escape.

Three days ago, Lucas Mitchell and I switched bodies, and our lives were thrown into complete chaos.
