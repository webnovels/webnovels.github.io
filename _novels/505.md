The day Chloe’s wedding to Julian was supposed to happen, my love jumped from the eighteenth floor.

I opened his studio, and it was filled with countless portraits of Seraphina.

The strokes were wild and frenzied, almost deranged, yet they pulsed with his overwhelming affection.

My friend Maya said, "Julian loved Seraphina for ten years. She was his only light."

When I opened my eyes again, I saw Julian, cornered by the school bully Jax in our classroom. I quietly closed the door.

Later, he knocked on my window in the pouring rain, his voice hoarse and desperate.

"Chloe, are you… are you giving up on me?"
