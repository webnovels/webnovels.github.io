"The black cat is way cuter. That white cat looks as disgusting as you, sis!" Emma sneered.

It was the exact same scene as before. Last time, I hadn't dared to argue back. I had silently picked up the white cat's cage and left.

But this time was different. I grabbed Emma's outstretched hand.

With a slight smile, I said: "Oh really? Then I'll take the black cat."

Emma's smug grin instantly froze. She stared at me in disbelief:

"How dare you talk to me like that! Do you need to be taught a lesson?"

She raised her hand, about to slap me across the face.

In my past life, I would have backed down to keep the peace in the family.

But this time, I caught her hand mid-air and slapped her instead.

Seeing Emma get hit, our mom, who had always stayed silent when I was bullied, suddenly changed her tune:

"Your sister was just joking with you! Why did you hit her so hard? I swear, why did I give birth to such an ungrateful child like you!"

I ignored her and calmly picked up the cage with the black cat, turning to leave.

Just as I was about to walk out, Emma finally recovered from the shock of the pain.

She screamed hysterically after me: "No! How am I supposed to pass the SATs without it!"

I paused.

So Emma had been reborn too.

Emma and I were born just three minutes apart, but our personalities couldn't have been more different.

I had always been timid and afraid of conflict. Emma was domineering and loved bullying others at school.

I generally tried to avoid her in daily life.

But who could have guessed that everything would change three months before the SATs.

Emma had spent her high school years smoking, drinking, and fighting. She cycled through boyfriends like changing clothes.

She hung out with a bad crowd outside of school every day.

Forget getting into a good college - she'd be lucky to get into any college at all.

Mom was worried sick. She heard that the charms sold at this shop had special powers that could help with exams.

That's why she had brought us all this way to buy them.

In my past life, even though my white cat was supposed to help distinguish right and wrong, it would mysteriously fall asleep during every exam.

Meanwhile, Emma's grades kept improving.

Not only did she easily get into an Ivy League school, but she also caught the eye of a rich classmate who fell in love with her at first sight.

I failed the SATs miserably. Unwilling to accept defeat, I decided to take a gap year and try again.

But my grades kept getting worse and worse. In the end, I died from the stress one night.

Just before I died, Emma told me the truth - that all my good luck had been stolen by her.

Thankfully, the heavens had given me another chance.

This time, I refused to repeat the same mistakes.

"What are you spacing out for? Let's go!" Emma snapped at me, her face dark with anger.

I glanced at her and the drowsy black cat in her arms, raising an eyebrow:

"Emma, you better take good care of it. After all, your entire future depends on this cat now."

"Mind your own business!" She slammed the car door shut with a thunderous bang.

Through the window, I saw her viciously throw the white cat's cage to the ground:

"Useless thing! Just looking at you pisses me off!"

Oh Emma, you're being too hasty.

The white cat may not be able to help you ace the SATs, but it could open up a whole different path for you.
