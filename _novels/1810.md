My husband always left little clues after cheating.
One time, I found a lipstick under the passenger seat of his car.
Another time, a pink thong under the bed.
This time, I found a ripped black stocking under his pillow.
They were all left by the same nurse who worked with him at the hospital.
I always pretended not to see them.
But my indifference seemed to piss off the nurse. 
She deliberately sent me explicit photos of them to provoke me.
【You're just getting old, Dr. Miller is tired of you. You know how passionate he was when he pinned me down on your bed?】
I silently saved them. 
Finally, I put together a thirty-five-page presentation and uploaded it online.
She likes to share, doesn't she? Then let's give her plenty to share.

Ryan stood at the bedroom doorway, disgustedly pinching the black stocking.
"Lily, we need to talk about this."
After pulling an all-nighter making that presentation, my eyelids felt too heavy to lift.
I closed my laptop.
"Nothing to talk about. You deal with it."
"No."
Ryan ignored my cold expression and started talking anyway.
"Last week, you were on a business trip, and I had a major surgery. I gave the key to someone from my department to help me grab some fresh clothes from home."
"I didn't expect it to be Chloe, and I certainly didn't expect her to do something so disgusting..."
"Lily, you have to believe me."
"Are you done?"
He was stunned into silence.
I tried to push past him into the bathroom.
"Lily."
Ryan grabbed my wrist.
"You don't care at all?"
I used to care.
A year ago, the first time I found lipstick in his car, I smashed the dinnerware we bought on our honeymoon.
Six months ago, when I saw their Ins post about going to the movies, I cut all his white shirts into pieces.
Three months ago, when I saw the flirty emojis she sent him on his phone, I smashed our living room TV.
I fought with him countless times, but we never broke up.
Because we were childhood sweethearts.
At three, we fought over the same building block in preschool.
At ten, he took the scolding from the teacher for me.
At seventeen, the night before the most important exams of our senior year, he climbed through my window onto my balcony.
Just to say one thing.
"Lily, wherever you go, I'll go too."
Twenty-seven years of memories wrapped around me like a thick cocoon.
"Ryan, I'm really tired."
I struggled to pull my wrist free, but couldn't.
"What do you mean?"
He stared at me, not wanting to miss a single expression.
"Let go."
"No! You have to explain yourself today!"
Struggling was almost my instinct.
In the frantic push and pull, something got knocked over.
A sharp, shattering sound exploded in the dead of night.
We both froze.
A pile of scattered porcelain shards gleamed coldly under the light.
It was a ceramic vase we'd made together.
Over all these years, we'd moved several times, fought countless times.
I'd smashed necklaces he'd given me, furniture we'd picked out together, but I'd never touched this vase.
It had always sat there, holding dried baby's breath.
Now it was broken.
Ryan flinched, suddenly loosening his grip.
But I had no strength left, and I sank straight onto the broken porcelain shards.
Instantly, blood stained the white porcelain, blurring it red.
It also blurred all the time of my youth.
Ryan's face went instantly pale.
"Lily..."
His hands were trembling uncontrollably.
"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to, I—"
More and more blood flowed, pooling into a small puddle on the floor.
Strangely, I didn't feel any pain, just a stinging in my eyes.
He frantically scooped me up, and after a quick clean-up,
He drove me to the hospital.
His hands, clutching the steering wheel, wouldn't stop shaking.
He drove to the hospital at top speed.
Went straight to the ER, but to my surprise, Chloe was the one on duty.
He frowned and said.
"Get someone else."
Chloe gave a playful shrug.
"Oh, no, I'm the only one available right now."
Ryan was about to say something else, but I cut him off, pointing at Chloe.
"You do it."
My opinion of Chloe had always been straightforward.
Stupid and malicious.
But I didn't expect her to be so brazen, even in front of Ryan.
When she deliberately poked my wound with the tweezers for the third time,
Ryan shoved her away.
"Can you even treat a wound, damn it? You can't even do basic bandaging, how did you get into this hospital? Get out!"
Chloe looked on the verge of tears, but Ryan ignored her.
He immediately went to change into scrubs and performed surgery on me.
