Chapter 1
"Are you sure you want to deregister all your personal information, Ms. Anderson? Once you do so, you'll cease to exist in the system. No one will be able to find you."

Alyssa Anderson paused briefly, then nodded resolutely. "Yes, I want to make sure no one can ever find me."

The person on the other end was perplexed. However, they responded promptly, "Understood, Ms. Anderson. The process should be completed within two weeks. Please wait patiently."

After ending the call, Alyssa pulled out her phone and booked a flight to Flontain scheduled for two weeks later.

Meanwhile, a replay of Splendor Group's press conference was airing on television.

A week ago, Stefan Splenstone, CEO of Splendor Group, unveiled a piece of jewelry featuring the finest diamonds and gemstones in the world. The unique creation dedicated to his wife was named "Love, Lys."

Stefan had named it after Alyssa, publicly declaring his eternal love for her to the world.

The release of "Love, Lys" instantly went viral, dominating major platforms and remaining a hot topic. As the press conference ended, the broadcast transitioned to interviews with random people on the street.

"Excuse me, sir, have you heard about Mr. and Mrs. Splenstone's fairy-tale romance?"

A woman in a floral dress gushed with envy, "Who doesn't? Didn't Mr. Splenstone publish a book full of notes about Mrs. Splenstone? Like, just because she loves cherries, he planted cherry trees all over their villa's garden! 

"I told my husband to take notes, and he said he could never be that kind of man. Ugh, I'm the one who ends up frustrated the more I compare them!"

The reporter continued to interview several others.

A college student stood at the microphone, clutching her hands to her chest. Her eyes were practically shining when she sighed, "They're basically the embodiment of a romance novel, aren't they? Mr. Splenstone is like the king of true love.

"Four years ago, when Mrs. Splenstone was on the brink of death from kidney failure and urgently needed a transplant, Mr. Splenstone turned out to be a match. Desperate, he ignored everyone's objections and immediately went into surgery the same day to give her his kidney. 

"He said Mrs. Splenstone was his life, and if she were gone, he wouldn't live either. What kind of absolute perfect man is that?"

…

The reporter asked countless people; every single one of them admired Stefan and Alyssa's love story.

The news replayed over and over. 

However, Alyssa only put on a mocking smile.

Ever since she was young, Alyssa had always been pursued by admirers because of her looks. But coming from a broken family where her parents divorced early, she never had high hopes for love. 

No matter who confessed to her, she always refused, saying, "Sorry, I don't want a boyfriend, and I'm even less interested in romance."

That was until she met Stefan.

Unlike others, Stefan persistently pursued her for three years. After countless rejections, instead of giving up, he only tried harder. He even risked his life in a high-stakes race just to win her a necklace she liked, nearly losing his life in the process.

Only then did Alyssa waver.

After they started dating, Stefan's love never faltered. Instead, he did everything he could to make her happy. 

Stefan had gradually softened Alyssa's hardened heart.

He even proposed to her 52 times before she finally gathered the courage to say yes and agreed to marry him.

On the day of the proposal, Alyssa looked at the ring on her finger with tears brimming in her eyes. She promised Stefan, "Stefan, from now on, I will do my best as your wife. Whether in life or death, in wealth or poverty, I will never betray you. 

"But there's one thing you must remember—I will not tolerate lies. If you deceive me, I will disappear from your life forever."

Those beautiful memories were now shattered by harsh reality, reduced to nothing but illusions.

Three months ago, she discovered that Stefan had been hiding a mistress all along. During the day, he stayed with her, but at night, he was with that other woman. His heart had long been divided between two people.

It was indeed true that the ones who burned brightest faded the fastest, while those who paced themselves would keep boiling over.

Alyssa gave a bitter smile as she turned off the TV. Then, she printed out the divorce agreement she had long prepared and signed her name.

Her words had become a reality. She would stay true to what she said back then. She would disappear from Stefan's world.

After signing it, she placed the divorce agreement in an exquisite gift box, wrapped it carefully, and set it aside.

Stefan walked through the door an hour later.

Before he even had time to change his shoes, he hurried over to Alyssa. He wrapped her in an embrace and softly apologized, "I'm sorry, Lyssa. I was out picking up the jewelry, so I came back late and missed our anniversary. Please don't be mad, okay?"

He presented her with a box labeled "Love, Lys", coaxing her as he spoke. His black shirt was slightly unbuttoned at the top, leaving the first button undone.

As he lowered his head, Alyssa's gaze landed on the skin beneath his collar. The marks—kisses and scratches—etched across his chest stabbed her eyes like sharp daggers.

Was he really picking up jewelry, or had he spent the evening in Juliette Landon's bed?

He had probably just gotten out of her bed, hadn't he?

Stefan, oblivious to Alyssa's emotions, placed the jewelry on her. His eyes lit up as the dazzling jewels highlighted her stunning beauty.

"Lyssa, you're breathtaking," Stefan praised genuinely, his gaze filled with admiration.

But Alyssa showed no sign of joy. Her eyes were slightly red as she pushed the gift box containing the divorce agreement toward him. "This is for you."

Stefan looked puzzled. "What's this?"

Alyssa wore a faint smile. "A gift. You gave me one for our anniversary, so naturally, I should give you something, too."

Stefan's eyes brightened with excitement. He treated the box like a precious treasure, eager to open it immediately.

But Alyssa stopped him. "Open it in two weeks."

"Why two weeks?" he asked, confused.

Alyssa emphasized, "Because it'll be more meaningful for you to open it then."

Stefan froze for a moment at her words. He didn't ask further as he simply held her hand and kissed it tenderly. "Whatever my darling says. Your husband here will wait for the surprise."

Then, like an obedient puppy, he tore off a sticky note, wrote a line, and carefully stuck it on the gift box.

"Open in two weeks."

Alyssa watched him silently as he did all this. "Stefan," she thought. "I hope you truly find it a surprise by then."

Chapter 2
When morning came, Stefan, as usual, gave Alyssa a good morning kiss.

"Lyssa, I missed our wedding anniversary yesterday. How about I make it up to you today? Let's go to the amusement park. You wanted to go to one, didn't you?"

Alyssa wasn't interested and was about to refuse, but he had already started preparing everything for the outing. He even picked out clothes for her to wear.

After they arrived at the amusement park, Stefan paid her constant attention.

The moment Alyssa pursed her lips slightly, he thoughtfully brought water to her mouth without delay. If she glanced at a stuffed toy for even a second longer, he bought it for her on the spot.

Carousel rides, bumper cars, Ferris wheels…

Stefan didn't care how childish the activities might seem; as long as Alyssa enjoyed them, he was willing to join her.

He held her hand almost the entire time, refusing to let go. Even when she resisted and tried to pull away, he would clasp her hand firmly.

At the end of the day, he bought a balloon and tied it to her bag, smiling as he said, "Lyssa, this way, I will never lose you."

Never lose her, huh?

But Alyssa was planning to go to a place where Stefan would never find her.

"Stefan, you've already lost me a long time ago," she thought to herself.

The beautiful couple looked so affectionate that they caught the attention of many visitors at the amusement park. Before long, someone recognized them.

"Look, that's Mr. and Mrs. Splenstone! I can't believe we're seeing them in person! They're so sweet!" A young woman excitedly jumped in place and pulled her boyfriend toward Alyssa. "Um… Can we take a photo with you? We're huge fans of yours!"

Seeing how enthusiastic the woman was, Alyssa agreed to the request as she didn't want to let her down.

While Stefan wasn't fond of taking photos, he cooperated for Alyssa's sake.

With a click of the camera, the photo was taken, and the young couple beamed with excitement.

"You two are such a perfect match. I'm so envious. Please, stay happy together forever!"

Stefan smiled gently and nodded.

But what he failed to notice was that Alyssa, standing silently by his side, never said a word. She alone knew that they didn't have a future together.

As they ate during their lunch break, Stefan kept glancing at his phone repeatedly.

Noticing Alyssa's gaze, he quickly apologized with a look of guilt. "Lyssa, I'm sorry, I have some urgent work to handle. Be good and eat first. I'll focus on spending time with you in a bit, okay?"

However, in the very next moment, a notification popped up on his screen. It was a "Luxury Castle" gift from a live-streaming platform.

Stefan was lying. He wasn't working—he was watching a live stream.

Alyssa's lips curled into a sarcastic smirk as she silently opened Juliette's live stream on her own phone.

Juliette Landon was a small-time influencer. However, not long ago, Stefan had signed her to his company and even made her the spokesperson for "Love, Lys".

Speculation swirled among the public.

How could someone like Juliette land such an enviable opportunity? Many wondered if someone powerful was backing her.

What they didn't know was that the person supporting her was none other than Stefan.

At that moment, Juliette stood at the amusement park entrance, streaming live. Holding her phone, she flaunted to her viewers, "Look, everyone! This amusement park was a gift from my boyfriend. You even get a discount if you mention my name at the entrance. Come and have fun!"

Alyssa's hand, clutching her phone, turned cold and stiff at those words. The amusement park Stefan had brought her to today… was a gift for Juliette.

The comment section was flooded with skepticism.

"Stop bluffing. How could a small-time influencer bag such a wealthy benefactor?"

"You're just clout chasing. Without proof, I could also claim the park's mine while standing at its gates."

"You're out of your mind if you think anyone would believe you. You do know this park is worth billions, don't you?"

Aggrieved, Juliette bit her lip. "I'm not lying! Look, my name is on this, no?"

As she spoke, she pulled out a property deed from her bag. In black and white, Juliette's name was clearly written on the document.

Comments flooded the screen of the live stream instantly as viewers expressed their astonishment.

"I was ignorant, alright? So this is what a big shot looks like."

"Giving away an amusement park? This level of spoiling is on par with the legendary Mr. Splenstone and his undying love for Mrs. Splenstone!"

"They say a man would only spend on where his heart is. Why can't I meet a dream guy like this?"

"Because there are only two dream guys in the world. One is Mr. Splenstone, and the other is Juliette's mysterious boyfriend. Let's vote! Who do you think loves their partner more—Mr. Splenstone for Mrs. Splenstone or Juliette's boyfriend for Juliette? Type 1 for the former, 2 for the latter."

The screen was flooded with "1" votes. After all, Stefan's devotion to his wife was legendary—he had not only spent a fortune but nearly sacrificed his life for her.

Just then, an account named Dear Julie suddenly appeared and sent a wave of 10,000 Yacht gifts in one go. The dazzling effects filled the entire screen, leaving everyone dumbfounded.

The live stream's viewership skyrocketed from hundreds of thousands to over ten million in an instant.

Soon after, a message appeared on the screen. "Of course, I love Julie more."

Chaos erupted as the viewers spammed the comments, expressing their awe.

"The rich man himself has shown up!"

Juliette smiled triumphantly, her eyes filled with the arrogance of someone thoroughly spoiled. "See? I told you all; my boyfriend loves me."

Alyssa's hand trembled as she clutched her phone, her grip tightening with every second. When she looked up again, she caught sight of Stefan's faintly curled lips, his eyes brimming with adoration.

He was "Dear Julie".

It felt as if Alyssa's heart had been wrenched with all the force in the world. Even though the grip was gone now, the lingering pain refused to subside.

Chapter 3
Alyssa clutched her chest tightly with her right hand. The pain overwhelmed her to the point where she could barely catch her breath.

"Lyssa?" When Stefan finally noticed something was wrong, he rushed to her side. "What's wrong?"

The concern in his eyes seemed genuine, his expression that of a man who would crumble if anything happened to her. Yet, this very man who loved her so deeply had kept so many things secret from her.

She tried her best to control her emotions. "It's nothing… just a stitch in my side."

Stefan immediately pressed his hand gently against her chest, ensuring she was okay. After confirming several times that she was fine, he insisted on taking her back to rest.

On the way home, he talked about various funny anecdotes, desperately trying to make her smile. No matter how hard he tried, though, her mood remained heavy.

Alyssa leaned against the car window, silently watching the scenery retreating outside. Her expression was unreadable.

"Lyssa, did I do something wrong?" Stefan asked cautiously, testing the waters.

"No," Alyssa finally said. "I was just thinking about a show I watched today."

Relieved, Stefan smiled and quickly followed up. "What was it about?"

At that, Alyssa slowly turned her head to face him, her eyes locking onto his. "The male lead used to love the female lead deeply, but when he fell for someone else, he kept it from her…"

She watched his face intently, catching every subtle shift in his expression. Then, in a calm voice, she added, "Stefan, if you ever fell out of love—"

"Never!" Stefan cut her off urgently, as if he couldn't even tolerate the thought. "Lyssa, you're the love of my life. Even if every man in the world betrayed their partner, I would never do that. I can't live without you."

Alyssa only felt a sharp pain in her heart. Stefan couldn't live without her, and yet, he had still gone out to taste the forbidden fruit.

She was about to respond when Stefan's phone suddenly rang. He hesitated for a moment, clearly considering whether to answer. 

Alyssa pushed his hand gently. "Go ahead and take it."

Reluctantly, Stefan obeyed and picked up the call.

Whatever the person on the other end said, his expression shifted from calm to a slight narrowing of his eyes. Gradually, his demeanor became unnatural, almost strained.

Stefan's Adam's apple bobbed slightly as he hung up the call and turned to Alyssa. "Lyssa, there's an emergency at work. I need to go now. Let me call a car to take you home, okay?"

Alyssa quietly nodded and stepped out of the car.

Watching Stefan's Maybach disappear down the road, she hailed a cab and climbed in. Instead of going back to the villa, she instructed the driver, "Please follow that car in front,"

The cab driver asked no questions as she started the engine and trailed the Maybach at a steady distance.

Eventually, the car came to a stop in front of a villa.

From a distance, Alyssa saw a young woman dressed in a bunny outfit opened the door. When a man stepped out of the car, she immediately threw herself into his arms with a bright smile.

The woman was Juliette; the man was Stefan.

They had barely embraced before they began to kiss, passionately and without restraint.

After what felt like an eternity, Juliette pulled away, her breath uneven. She playfully tugged at Stefan's tie.

"Master," she teased with a coy smile, "your little bunny has an even bigger surprise prepared for you. Want to see it?"

Her finger lightly tapped against his Adam's apple as she spoke.

Stefan's throat bobbed as he swallowed hard, his grip tightening around her hand, his eyes dark with desire. "It took me 15 minutes to cover a 30-minute drive, darling. What do you think?"

Juliette giggled, curling her slender fingers around his as she led him back toward the car. "Come. It's in the car."

The two climbed back inside, and soon, the vehicle began to rock gently. The rocking grew stronger and stronger with each passing moment.

No one could have known that Alyssa was sitting in a car nearby, watching everything unfold.

Even though she had long since let go of any hope for him, the scene still hurt her deeply. It felt like a sharp hook had pierced her heart, tearing it apart. 

Clutching her chest tightly, she gasped for air as tears streamed uncontrollably down her face.

When they were still in love, Stefan had cherished her deeply. Even in moments of passion, he restrained himself, not wanting to take things too far.

He had told her that the first time was special, and things would only be perfect if they waited until their wedding night.

He pursued her for three years and dated her for three more.

Finally, they reached their wedding night.

That evening, the usually composed and powerful Stefan was a bundle of nerves. When he removed her clothing, the tips of his ears turned bright red.

He had valued her so much, paying careful attention to her every feeling. The moment he claimed her as his, he had been so overcome with emotion that he wept.

Over and over, he had whispered into her ear, "Lyssa, you're finally mine. I love you. I'll love you forever."

At that moment, she truly felt cherished. She thought that perhaps no one in this lifetime would ever love her more than Stefan did.

Stefan only loved Alyssa.

That was what he had promised her himself.

But now, he was the one who broke that promise.

The female driver in front noticed Alyssa crying her heart out. She let out a deep sigh, handing Alyssa a tissue. "That's how men are; every single one of them cheats. Even my husband cheated. But with a child, I can't even think about leaving…" 

As she talked about her own painful story, she choked several times before she continued, "Young lady, don't be too upset. You're already married. Just endure it. Forgive him this once. Pretend you didn't see anything."

Clutching the tissue in her hand, Alyssa replied in a hoarse yet resolute voice, "No, I will not forgive him."

She quietly swore, "Stefan, I will never forgive you."

When she got home, she started rummaging through her belongings, gathering everything Stefan had ever gifted her. That included the priceless "Love, Lys".

She made a phone call.

"Is this the property agency? I'd like to sell all these items and donate the proceeds to the Women's Foundation. I would like to help women who want to divorce but can't because of children or financial constraints."

In just an hour, she sent everything away. Then, she began packing her luggage.

Halfway through, Stefan suddenly returned. He burst through the door amidst the wind and rain, not even bothering to use an umbrella. His whole body was soaked, the chill of damp air clinging to him. 

Without even changing clothes, he rushed to Alyssa. His voice trembled as he asked, "Lyssa, why did you sell 'Love, Lys'?"

Chapter 4
"Love, Lys" was of immense value; the only feasible way to sell it was through an auction house. In other words, Stefan must have seen "Love, Lys" listed at the auction.

Alyssa didn't answer right away but instead asked, "Did you go to the auction house?"

Stefan froze for a moment, his expression somewhat evasive. It took him several seconds before he finally replied, "I went to buy you some jewelry."

For her, or for Juliette?

Juliette had prepared such a grand surprise for him; naturally, he would feel obligated to return the gesture.

Alyssa had already regained her composure. Her voice was calm as she replied, "I didn't sell it. I donated it."

Hearing this, Stefan sighed helplessly and gently held her hand. "Lyssa, I know you have a kind heart, but if you want to donate something, you could have donated something else. This one, however, should never be given away."

As he spoke, he pulled out a box from his coat pocket and placed it in front of Alyssa. The black velvet box opened, revealing "Love, Lys". Its unique brilliance remained untouched.

"I bought it back. 'Love, Lys' is the symbol of my love for you. You can't take it off no matter what."

With that, Stefan once again put the necklace back around her neck himself.

As Alyssa looked at the necklace, now back where it belonged, she let out a self-deprecating laugh.

"Oh, Stefan, you and your impeccable acting skills," she thought. "You've just rushed back from another woman, and now you're whispering sweet nothings to me."

That night, Stefan's phone suddenly rang as Alyssa was about to fall asleep. He quickly silenced it and gently patted Alyssa's back to comfort her.

A few seconds later, the phone rang again.

This repeated a few times.

Afraid of disturbing Alyssa, Stefan had no choice but to answer the call, albeit with a frown.

The voice on the other end was especially clear in the quiet room. "Stef, come out and play! The boys are all here; we're waiting for you."

Without a second thought, Stefan rejected the caller. "I need to put Lyssa to bed. I'm hanging up."

"Hey, hey, hey, don't hang up! Don't be a slave to your wife. How long has it been since you've hung out with the guys?"

"Yeah, everyone else gets a wife and forgets their friends. You, on the other hand, get a wife and completely throw your friends away. This is too much."

As the noise on the other end was loud, Stefan covered the speaker. "Alright, quiet down. I've told you, no one is more important than my wife. I'm staying with her."

Even after saying this, the other side didn't relent. They switched callers several times, determined to get Stefan to come out.

Alyssa, who was woken up by the noise and could no longer stay quiet, finally suggested, "You should hang out with them. It's been a while since you've seen them."

Stefan looked reluctant, but when Alyssa persuaded him again, he compromised. "I'll bring you with me, then. If you don't go, I won't go."

Immediately, the people on the other end started persuading Alyssa. 

"Alyssa, come with Stef. It'll be fun. Just come and join us!" one of them said.

Another chimed in, "Yeah, Alyssa, please come. If you don't, Stef won't come either."

In the end, Alyssa nodded, and only then did Stefan agree to go out.

…

As soon as Stefan opened the door to the private room, he saw his friends surrounded by a dozen or so women. His brow furrowed tightly, and without hesitation, he stepped back to leave.

Immediately, his friends tactfully ushered the women away. "Come on, let's get moving."

Only after all the women had left the room did Stefan's friends sigh in relief and pull him closer by the shoulder.

"Stef, how have you still not changed after all these years? Besides Alyssa, no other woman can get near you."

Stefan pushed his friend away in disgust, brushing off imaginary dust, "I'm a married man. I need to give Lyssa a sense of security. A bachelor like you wouldn't understand."

The entire room burst into laughter as they glanced at Alyssa. Although Stefan was out with his friends, his eyes were only on her the whole time.

When someone lit a cigarette, Stefan immediately shot them a warning look, signaling for them to put it out. "Lyssa doesn't like the smell of smoke."

When someone wanted to make a toast, Stefan shook his head without hesitation. "Lyssa doesn't like it when I smell like alcohol."

When someone started singing, Stefan frowned. "Turn it off. Lyssa likes it quiet."

He coldly rejected all the group's invitations. His focus was entirely on cutting fruit for Alyssa.

He skillfully cut the fruits before he placed a bowl of beautifully cut fruit in front of her. "Have some, Lyssa."

Noticing her thin dress and the slightly low temperature from the air conditioning, he quickly took off his jacket and draped it over her shoulders. "Lyssa, is this better? Are you still cold?"

Seeing this, Stefan's friend group playfully teased, "Stef, you're truly the husband of the year!"

Chapter 5
Alyssa remained silent the whole time. After a while, she no longer wanted to continue pretending.

"It's late. I'm leaving," she said. 

Stefan stood up to follow her, but several of his friends quickly stopped him.

"Alyssa has a weak body; she needs to rest," one of them said. "But it's been a long time since we all hung out. You can't leave now!"

His other friend quickly agreed. "Yeah, let Alyssa go back and get some sleep. You can stay and have fun with us!"

Alyssa gently pulled her hand out of Stefan's grasp and spoke slowly. "The driver will take me back. You should stay."

As soon as she finished speaking, she turned and walked away so briskly that Stefan didn't manage to stop her.

It wasn't long after the car left that Alyssa found a phone in her coat pocket that wasn't hers. It had a black case—it was Stefan's.

With a frown, she told the driver to turn around.

Right when the car stopped outside the bar, Alyssa saw Juliette getting out of a cab.

Juliette was busy checking her makeup on her phone. She didn't even have to watch where she was going as she headed straight for the private room.

Alyssa instinctively tightened her grip on the phone and followed Juliette. 

Sure enough, Juliette stopped in front of the room where Stefan was. As soon as she entered, she threw herself into his arms.

Stefan immediately wrapped his arm around her waist and lovingly tousled her locks. "You're here early."

Juliette leaned against his shoulder with a playful smile. "I missed you! I rushed right over as soon as I got your call."

Stefan chuckled at that. "In that case, you deserve a reward."

With that, he placed a passionate kiss on her lips. Their tongues entwined as their kiss deepened.

"Alright, alright, no more showing off!"

Stefan's friends didn't seem surprised at all. They even started to laugh and tease the couple.

As Alyssa stood outside the door and watched everything through the crack, she felt a chill run through her body.

It turned out that everyone knew about Stefan's affair with Juliette. They had all been putting on an act in front of Alyssa.

"Stef, now that Julie's here, we can do something more… daring, right?"

Stefan's friends laughed as they called for the women who were in the room earlier. Soon, almost every man was holding a woman in his arms.

The game was simple. After spinning a bottle, whoever the bottle pointed to has to play Truth or Dare. 

After several rounds, the bottle finally pointed at Stefan.

Everyone cheered, the excitement in the room reaching a peak.

"Stef, when was the last time you got busy?"

The question was filled with innuendo; everyone knew what was being implied.

Stefan raised an eyebrow and answered, unfazed, "Yesterday. In the car."

The response caused an uproar within the group.

"Damn, that's impressive! How was it?"

Juliette, already blushing, buried her face in Stefan's chest. 

Stefan smiled slyly and explained, "She served me well. It was… intoxicating."

One of his friends laughed. "I told you, the grass is always greener!"

"Exactly, Stef," another agreed. "All men of our status have women on the side."

A third friend added, "As long as you keep it a secret, you can enjoy life to the fullest. Alyssa will never know."

As they continued to joke, the men kissed their companions and did more inappropriate things.

When Alyssa's name was mentioned, Stefan's smile faltered. His expression darkened, and he became serious. "Don't let Lyssa know, or… you know the consequences."

"We got it! She won't find out."

Every word was like a dagger to Alyssa's heart. The laughter and taunts reverberated in her ears, and she felt a coldness spread through her body. Her legs went numb, and in a daze, she trudged out of the building.

The driver, who noticed her change in demeanor, hurried to her side and intended to go in to notify Stefan.

However, Alyssa stopped him. "No need to send me home. I'd like to take a stroll by myself. And don't tell Stefan I came back."

After sending the driver back, Alyssa walked alone on the empty streets.

Rain suddenly began to pour down, but she seemed unaffected by it. The cold rain only made her more alert.

Time seemed to go by as she walked.

She kept going for a long time—longer than the night when she was 17 and hurt her ankle in the snow, and Stefan piggybacked her home.

At that moment, she realized how quickly feelings could change.

Chapter 6
Once Alyssa arrived home, she came down with a high fever that refused to break.

The tipsy Stefan panicked when he returned and saw her unconscious with her cheeks flushed red. Without hesitation, he picked her up and rushed her to the hospital.

When Alyssa regained consciousness, her heavy eyelids fluttered before she finally managed to open them.

Seeing her awake, the nurse changing her IV drip exclaimed in surprise, "Mrs. Splenstone, you're finally awake! You've had a fever for an entire day. 

"Mr. Splenstone was so worried that he stayed by your side the whole time. He only stepped out just now to take a phone call. Should I let him know you're awake? He'll be so happy."

Alyssa shook her head. "No need," she replied in a hoarse voice.

The nurse nodded without further comment. After finishing her task, she quietly left the room.

The large hospital room grew silent, so silent that Alyssa could hear Stefan's voice outside as he talked on the phone. 

Usually calm and composed, Stefan only ever lost his composure around her. But now, his tone carried an unmistakable joy and excitement. Moments later, his footsteps faded, signaling his departure.

Summoning all her strength, Alyssa got out of bed. She followed him with heavy but determined steps.

She descended a few floors before she saw Stefan supporting Juliette as they walked out of the obstetrics department. Their faces were lit with unrestrained smiles, their upturned lips unable to conceal their shared joy.

When Juliette spotted Alyssa, she feigned surprise and called out, "Mrs. Splenstone! What a coincidence to see you at the hospital too."

Hearing that, Stefan looked up and locked eyes with Alyssa, who stood not far away. His body stiffened instantly, and he quickly released his hold on Juliette.

"Lyssa! I… I came down to pick up your medication. I accidentally ran into Juliette. She's pregnant, and I was worried something might happen, so I helped her a bit," he stammered nervously, scrambling to explain in case Alyssa misunderstood.

Alyssa only felt her breath hitch as she looked at Juliette's abdomen. She closed her eyes briefly and asked after a moment, "Ms. Landon... When did you get pregnant? Why isn't the child's father here?"

Juliette lovingly caressed her belly, her smile radiant with happiness. "I just found out. It's already been a month! The father isn't here because he's busy, but when he heard the news, he was overjoyed. 

"He bought me several villas and transferred me a hundred million dollars. Tonight, he's even planning to set off fireworks across the city to celebrate the fruit of our love!" Her tone brimmed with pride as she flaunted her joy. 

Alyssa merely stared at her for a long time before managing a faint smile. "Is that so?"

Juliette's grin grew even more complacent. "Yes, Mrs. Splenstone. Since we all have some free time today, why don't we have a meal together? I can invite the child's father to join us."

Stefan's expression darkened abruptly at those words. He shot Juliette a cold glare, instantly silencing her. "There's no need. Lyssa doesn't have time for that."

Stefan immediately turned to Alyssa, pulling her into a gentle embrace. His tone softened as he coaxed her tenderly, "Lyssa, you're still not fully recovered. You shouldn't be walking around."

He added, "Juliette is just a spokesperson; she's not worth your attention."

Juliette's face turned pale before flushing crimson at Stefan's condescending tone. Lowering her head, she muttered timidly, her eyes brimming with tears, "I… I was too full of myself. How could I possibly be worthy of dining with Mrs. Splenstone?"

She wiped her tears, turned on her heel, an
