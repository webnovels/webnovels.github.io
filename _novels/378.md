 My Wife Gifted My Estate To Her Secretary. She Paid The Price.

My wife actually gifted my private estate to her male secretary.

The garden swing was burnt, and my mother’s cherished flowerbeds were ruined.

I confronted my wife in a fury, but she just casually replied, “What’s the big deal? You’re a grown man, why are you so hung up on this?”

I roared, “Get everyone out by ten, and restore everything to how it was. Or else…”

Just like before, my wife blocked me again.

So, I immediately called the police, citing illegal trespassing on private property and malicious destruction of private assets.

Then, I turned around and donated all her beloved jewelry and designer bags.

Since some people don’t listen, I don’t mind teaching them a lesson in 'boundaries'!
