Having no choice, I pretended to fall asleep, waiting for her to have someone send me back to the bedroom before leaving.

But when I became aware again, I realized I had actually fallen asleep.

Aunt Susan, the housekeeper, saw I was awake and quickly came over to pour me a glass of water, asking: "Young master, how did you sleep this time?"

"Look at what's covering you - it's a silk summer blanket that the young mistress just bought at an auction."

"You get hot easily, so this is perfect. It's nice and cool but won't make you too cold."

"The young mistress is so thoughtful and gentle. It's a shame my old man is never so considerate..."

Her eyes were full of admiration and envy, and the day seemed no different than before.

But I clearly understood that everything had changed.

And I no longer wanted to pretend nothing had happened and continue treating her as the wife who loved me most.

So I raised my hand to call Aunt Susan, and wrote on her palm.

"What does the young master need 100 million for?" she asked.

After pondering for a moment, I changed my request to wanting a watch.

Seeing this, Aunt Susan wasn't surprised.

Good things in the city weren't cheap, and some precious watches could sell for that price.

Besides, Olivia had previously spent 200 million to set off fireworks across the city just to make me happy.

Now just 100 million was no problem.

Although she didn't understand why I wanted to withdraw from my own savings, Aunt Susan still did as I asked.

Seeing her leave, I breathed a sigh of relief.

Before coming back yesterday, I had inquired and learned that those CEOs didn't want their sons to jump into the fire pit, nor did they want to offend the most powerful Ning family.

They had privately arranged with relevant personnel, giving 100 million each to change their sons' unmarried status.

I wanted to escape this fate for myself.

But just as it was about to be resolved, Olivia cut it off at the waist.

Because it off at the wa Aunt Susan said: "The young mistress brought back a seriously ill child."

"The famous doctor she invited said it would cost 70 million. The young mistress gave out all the liquid assets including the young master's savings."

Hearing this, my face instantly turned deathly pale, and all the hope in my eyes was extinguished in an instant.

Seeing me looking dazed, Aunt Susan quickly came over to support me, not forgetting to comfort me: "Young master, don't panic."

"The young mistress is so capable, it won't take long for her to earn back this money."

"It's just a watch. You can buy it after a while and it'll be the same."

She spoke, but I couldn't listen anymore. I just staggered towards her study.

I wanted to question her about why she did this, but when I was just a few steps away, I saw through the crack in the door Olivia holding a 4-year-old boy with eyes full of heartache.

One hand was still holding the hand of a man whose eyes were red from crying.

"Jack, don't worry. I won't stand by and watch our son get into trouble."

"I've already gone to prepare the money the famous doctor wants. Even if it means losing everything, I won't give up."

The woman spoke, and Jack seemed to find support, choking back sobs as he tightly hugged Olivia.

When his gaze met mine, his eyes were full of provocation.

I frowned slightly, but saw him seem to be startled, quickly backing away and looking at me helplessly.

"Mr. Adam, please don't misunderstand. I'm the director of the orphanage who raised this child."

"I lost control just now only because I feel so bad for the child. I really have no other thoughts, and this child will be your child from now on anyway."

He spoke, looking pitiful and cautious.

It was clearly his own child, yet he was handing him over and acting as if nothing had happened.

Olivia couldn't help but frown, and even her eyes held a trace of dissatisfaction when she looked at me.

In an instant, my heart couldn't help but ache, but soon, I composed myself and handed over the note I had written.
