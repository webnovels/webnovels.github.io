It must have been the price for interfering with Olivia's death last time. I found myself in the hospital again when I woke up.

I don't know who saved me, but as soon as I opened my eyes, I saw Olivia in front of me.

Her expression was unreadable. Before I could say anything, she spoke first.

"Alright, I know you deliberately made yourself sick to come find me, but it won't be so easy for me to forgive you."

The next moment, a group of people appeared at the door.

In our five years of dating, I vaguely recognized some of them - Olivia's relatives, uncles and aunts.

"If you want me to forgive you, then make all my relatives live long and healthy lives!"

"After all, you're only paying the price of some illness, while they can live the rest of their lives without any pain or sickness."

"Cough!"

I gritted my teeth hard, a metallic taste filling my mouth. Looking at Olivia, I only felt disgusted.

All those years of true love crumbled in my mind, each scene carrying an extremely cold chill, freezing my heart with pain.

"Get out!" I shouted.

Large amounts of blood were coughed up. If my subordinate hadn't arrived in time to drive away the crowd of people,

Olivia might have really taken my life.

As she left, she still said, "Lucas, you're not even taking the way out I'm giving you. Just wait and regret it when I die!"

I pulled at the corner of my pale lips, seeing the sympathetic look in my subordinate's eyes, and smiled weakly.

"Let's go, back to the Underworld."

I would never return to this mortal world again.

Three days after returning to the Underworld, I remembered that I still had something in the room I shared with Olivia that was suppressing her fate.

When I appeared before Olivia again to retrieve the item, her complexion was already quite pale.

The pain of cancer must have left her weak and listless, but seeing me, she was still arrogant and smug.

"Finally knew to come back and apologize? How come you weren't so tough when you were throwing the ring and chasing away my relatives?"

I coldly took down the peach wood sword by the bed that was used to drive away ghosts, without saying a word.

"Hurry up and take away all your unlucky things. I was wondering why I felt surrounded by a deathly aura, turns out it was your doing."

"Now you're trying to find a way to keep me from dying? I'm telling you, don't even think about me forgiving you if you don't save Ethan."

Taking a deep breath, I coldly threw all the items into the trash can and turned to leave.

Seeing me like this, Olivia thought I was going to come back to apologize and beg for forgiveness like before, even though I was putting on a cold face while thinking of ways to save her.

So her voice behind me became even more arrogant.

"I'm telling you, even if you find a way now, I won't forgive you so easily."

"If you want to make it up to me, come back tomorrow and save the patient I'm treating!"

I paused in my steps, turning my face to the side and saying coldly.

"Just you wait."

While she was still fantasizing about becoming the savior of those around her, I had already left home without looking back.

My subordinate sent me a message that the death procedures were proceeding as scheduled.

In four days, I would need to personally collect Olivia's life to make amends for my mistakes.

The four days passed quickly. When I arrived by Olivia's side as she was on the brink of death,

She was lying on the street, barely breathing, having just been rejected by Ethan and berated by her relatives. Seeing me...

A light drizzle fell on her face, but she still maintained a superior attitude.

"Now you know to come save me? It's too late!"

"I'm telling you, the way I am now, rejected by them, is all because of you. I'm very unhappy, so you better figure out what to do."

I calmly looked down and walked in front of her.

The disdain on her face became even more apparent.

"I gave you too much face before, that's why you don't even know to help me up when you see me like this. Lucas, there's a limit to throwing tantrums. Do you have to wait until I'm about to die before coming to save me?"

"Who will you cry to when I'm dead!"

She stumbled as she tried to stand up, her hand shaking in the air.

I stood in place, looking down at her coldly.

"I told you long ago, I won't cry."

"What did you say?" Olivia looked up with wide eyes.

But when she saw my umbrella, she regained her arrogant and smug expression.

"Stop pretending, Lucas. Don't forget that if it weren't for me, how could you have lived until today? You love me so much, you can't live without me."

"I'm telling you, if you save me now, I can cooperate, but you have to save Ethan first."

"And my patients and relatives too."

"Otherwise, I'll go die right now and see what you'll do!"

She was fearless, but didn't expect me to just smile slightly.

"As you wish."

"What?" Olivia frowned.

I raised my hand, materializing a dagger with the symbol of Death on its hilt.

Slowly crouching down, I placed it against Olivia's neck.

"Your life was obtained through countless trials I endured in the mortal world. But as long as I don't care about your life, fate's call would have been enough for you to die a thousand times over."

"As for the others, didn't you say you'd die if I didn't save them? Then as you wish, face death!"

I lightly pulled the dagger across her chest...

Finally pressing it against her heart.
