"Lucas, so Olivia ran away from the wedding to be with another man."

At our pure white wedding venue, the big screen suddenly started live streaming, showing my runaway bride.

My Olivia was tightly hugging a man in her arms.

The man looked pale, while Olivia's eyes were full of concern.

"Don't worry, Ethan. I'll find a way to keep you alive."

The video cut off abruptly, just like my suddenly stopped heart.

In the four hours since this morning, my bride had only left me one message:

"Lucas, since you're a Reaper, I think we need to reconsider our wedding."

Just when I thought we were about to find happiness together.

She left me standing alone to face everyone's mockery.

A burst of loud static came from the speakers... the two of them reappeared on screen.

My trembling body was surrounded by layers of wedding guests, their voices full of ridicule and sarcasm.

"Looks like even falling for a medical genius can't save you from being cheated on."

"She'd rather comfort her own patient than come walk down the aisle. If you ask me, the bride herself must have sent this video to the big screen."

"Hey, hey, don't say that. It can't be. Look what they're doing?!"

Following the voices, I stared fixedly at the screen.

The huge screen was filled with intimate images of Olivia and Ethan.

On the pure white hospital bed, the two of them were entangled. Amidst Ethan's weak tears, Olivia kissed him passionately.

In an instant, all the memories of the past and the sudden loss exploded in my mind, shattering and raging.

Then, my gaze instantly dimmed, like a fallen star.

The guests began to leave. Someone said, could there be a more miserable groom than me?

No, there couldn't be. So I would no longer be her groom.

I don't know how long I sat there. When I got up to leave, Olivia rushed back with disheveled clothes.

Our eyes met. She awkwardly rubbed her nose and started to explain.

"I'm sorry honey, Ethan almost died just now, so I had to go to him first."

Hah, almost died.

That's the excuse she used every time she went to see Ethan.

But didn't she just find out? I'm a Reaper. How could I not know who was struggling on the brink of death?

My heart was completely exhausted. I couldn't be bothered to expose her lies.

Seeing my expression, Olivia frowned in displeasure:

"Come on, was it really necessary to throw the groom's suit on the ground?"

I swallowed the bitterness on my tongue, my lips stiff.

"I didn't throw it. The guests tore it off me while mocking me."

Hearing this, her face stiffened slightly, a flash of apology in her eyes.

She took the initiative to put the suit back on me.

"Alright, stop sulking. I'm back to marry you, aren't I?"

She looked at me, a smile on her lips, her tone certain. "Stop pretending. Didn't you say you can't live without me? You should be grateful I came back."

I pulled at the corner of my mouth, saying sarcastically, "Oh yes, I'm so grateful you came back after running away from our wedding."

She glanced at me and continued.

"I'll marry you, but you have to save Ethan first."

In an instant, I looked up at her in disbelief.

She continued speaking nonchalantly.

"You're a Reaper, right? You said you saved me. What's wrong with saving one more person?"

"You've already saved one, what's the difference between saving one or two?"

At this moment, anger surged in my heart.

No wonder she took the initiative to apologize to me. It was all for her beloved Ethan.

But she knew better than anyone that there was a price for a Reaper to save someone.

Saving her alone had already left my mortal body riddled with wounds.

Now she wanted me to save Ethan too. I stared straight at her and said coldly:

"Absolutely not."

In an instant, after a moment of satisfaction, her anger flared.

"Lucas! How dare you say you love me?!"

"I'm telling you, if you don't save Ethan, you can forget about this marriage!"

"Not only that, if Ethan dies, I'll die with him!"

Looking at her furious expression, I felt a sadness and exhaustion I had never experienced before.

I had told her long ago that saving anyone other than her would make me disappear into smoke.

I laughed weakly, tearing off the veil on my head and the ring in my hand, throwing them all on the ground.

"Do whatever you want."

"If you don't want to get married, then fine."

As I was leaving, I heard her shouting behind me.

"Lucas! When I die, don't you dare cry!"

My steps didn't falter.

I won't cry anymore.

Olivia.

I will never again be heartbroken over your death.
