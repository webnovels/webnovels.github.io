The quiet suburban neighborhood was silent in the dead of night.

I reluctantly returned home. As soon as I turned on the lights, I saw the gorgeous actress "Chloe Quinn" sitting cross-legged on a chair in the living room, directly facing the door, with a condescending look.

Those snow-white legs, that long slender swan-like neck, that one-in-a-million face.

Damn, I'm really beautiful.

The next moment, I caught his murderous gaze and my knees went weak. I fell to the ground with a thud.

Lucas Mitchell let out a cold laugh. "Chloe Quinn, did you enjoy spending that $3 million?"

I swallowed hard. "I'll earn it back for you?"

"How?"

"By stirring up some gossip, of course." I crawled up from the cold floor, pulled up a small stool, and sat down in front of Lucas Mitchell with an ingratiating smile.

"Think about it, now's the perfect time for you to stir up some rumors with Zoe Young. If we do it a few times, take some endorsements, shoot some magazine covers - the money will come rolling back in, right?"

Lucas Mitchell gave me a meaningful look. "Chloe Quinn, I'm married to you."

"Yeah, so what's the prob-" I suddenly stopped short.

Oh right, the Mitchell family had strict rules. This kind of scandalous news was strictly forbidden.

We couldn't do it.

"So what do we do?" I was stumped.

Lucas Mitchell pulled out my phone and calmly called my agent: "Are there any dating reality shows? I want to participate."

My face turned green.

"Are you trying to get me hated to death?"

Lucas Mitchell glanced at me sideways. "What do you mean?"

I hung my head and fell silent.

My agent had repeatedly warned me that with my face, everything I did seemed calculated. I attracted hate easily, and my mouth was faster than my brain, so I should never go on reality shows.

Last year I didn't believe him and went on a reality show. I gained over 100,000 anti-fans.

Even now, people still flood my social media calling me brainless.

"You have to go too," he added.

I looked up in confusion, seeing the innocent "Lucas Mitchell" through "Chloe Quinn's" eyes.

He smiled, his slender index finger gently lifting my chin. "If I stir up rumors with you, it won't violate family rules."

Faced with this drastically changed version of myself, I suddenly blushed, my nose growing hot.

"Um, I have another question."

"Go ahead."

"When you showered... did you look at my body?"

Surely my perfect waist-to-hip ratio and killer curves must have captivated him?

"...I didn't look," he answered, his voice a bit stiff.

I shyly said, "Then I'll go take a shower too-"

Before I could finish, my face started heating up, my gaze unconsciously drifting downward.

Lucas Mitchell quickly held my chin, tilting it back up. "No showering. Go to sleep."

"But I'll stink."

"Then stink."
