It's safe to say this was the most star-studded cast ever assembled for a dating reality show.

The red-hot newcomer Zoe Young, the controversial A-lister Chloe Quinn, and several other big-name actresses.

For the men, there was even a real business tycoon participating.

As soon as Lucas Mitchell's name was announced, it instantly became the top entertainment headline.

"I knew Zoe Young and Lucas Mitchell had something going on!"

"Chasing his wife all the way onto a reality show - the ship I've been rooting for is becoming real!"

"Calling it now, they'll be married sooner or later."

"Chloe Quinn is the most beautiful!" One of my fans interjected randomly.

"What are you butting in for? True fans follow their idol's lead. Brainless."

Before heading to the set, I gave Lucas Mitchell a million reminders:

"Don't wear heavy makeup, don't talk too much, be friendly to the other female contestants, and don't stare at men randomly."

Lucas Mitchell sat in the van with his arms crossed and eyes closed, looking more like he was going to crash a party.

I had no idea if he'd heard me or not.

There was a big screen in the villa where everyone could see real-time comments from viewers online.

As soon as I entered, I saw the screen filled with hearts floating by like flower petals scattered by fairies.

"Zoe Young and Lucas Mitchell forever!"

"Mr. Mitchell is here to chase his wife!"

Just when the atmosphere in the comments was at its most heated, "Chloe Quinn" and Zoe Young entered together.

Zoe Young wore a white fringed strapless mini dress, looking sweet and charming as she waved gracefully at the camera.

Noticing me staring at her, she suddenly blushed from her face to her ears and hid a bit behind "Chloe Quinn".

The camera followed, immediately revealing a sour face on screen.

Clearly, Mr. Mitchell hadn't gotten over the body-swap nightmare and was equally disgusted with everyone.

The comments instantly changed direction:

"Get lost, stop blocking my baby's screen time."

"Where did this corpse face come from? Scared me to death!"

"Zoe baby, stay away from her!"

Lucas Mitchell took in the audience's reactions, giving the camera a very cold glance.

"What's with her expression? Looking down on us?"

"No way, even Chloe Quinn is looking down on people now!"

"Chloe is the best!"

"Get out of here, hater."

I sighed inwardly. I was used to it by now. No matter what I did, I only attracted hate.

I just hoped Lucas Mitchell could keep a low profile. If he didn't say anything, I'd be grateful.

But the next second, there was a ripping sound as Zoe Young's dress tore open, the long skirt becoming a short one.

The culprit was "Chloe Quinn's" high heel.

An awkward silence fell over the scene.

"Damn, Chloe Quinn did that on purpose, right?"

"She was pretty manipulative on that show last year too. Causing drama as soon as she arrives."

Zoe Young lowered her head. "It's okay, I'm sure she didn't mean to."

Lucas Mitchell looked her over thoughtfully, casually saying "Sorry."

The audience was displeased again. "What kind of attitude is that?"

Afraid the situation would escalate and attract more hate, I quickly tried to smooth things over. "Zoe, why don't you go change clothes?"

Zoe Young turned and left, looking pitiful and wronged.

Lucas Mitchell stood in place, silently watching me.

This gaze made my heart inexplicably skip a beat. I thought about it, but there was nothing to explain.

At a Mitchell family banquet last year, his female business partner Victoria Xu bumped into me, spilling red wine on herself.

As she wiped it off, she said, "Miss Quinn is new here, it's understandable if she doesn't know how things work. I'm fine."

And I, like an idiot, stood there holding an empty wine glass, trying to explain to Lucas Mitchell: "She bumped into me."

Lucas Mitchell seemed not to hear, and just said to me: "If you're done eating, you should head back soon."

If there was a bit of liking at first, after that night, I never thought about a future with him again.

I still remember it was New Year's Day, and it was snowing heavily.

After leaving the Mitchell house, instead of going home, I flew to another province that night to film, and didn't return for several months.

The current situation was surprisingly similar to that day.

Lucas Mitchell probably thought of what happened that day too, and tried to explain:

"The dress accidentally got caught."

The comments went wild: "Chloe Quinn, have some shame."

I sighed. "I know. Be more careful next time."
