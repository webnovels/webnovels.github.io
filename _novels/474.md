On the day we were supposed to get married at the registry office, my girlfriend Sophia had me kicked out and went in with her childhood sweetheart instead.

She looked at me nonchalantly and said, "Lucas's child needs to be registered. Once we divorce, I'll marry you."

Everyone thought that I, being so devoted to her, would willingly wait another month for her. After all, I had already waited seven years.

But that very night, I accepted my family's arrangement for an international marriage and disappeared from her world.

Three years later, I returned to the country with my wife to pay respects to our ancestors. My wife had some urgent business to attend to, so she asked the local branch of our company to arrange someone to pick me up.

Unexpectedly, I ran into Sophia, whom I hadn't seen in three years.

"You've played around long enough. It's time to come back," she said. "Lucas's child is about to start kindergarten. You'll be responsible for dropping her off and picking her up."
