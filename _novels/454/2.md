"Yasmin Zhang, you're my personal assistant. How can you casually start fights in public?"

A tall, muscular young man, surrounded by bodyguards, strode quickly to where we were standing.

"Are you William Smith?" I asked.

I carefully examined the man in front of me. I had to admit, my dad did have good taste.

He was wearing a tailored suit, with sharp, chiseled features.

If I had to find any flaw, it would be the cold look in his eyes as he gazed at me.

"Mr. Smith, since this is our first meeting, please allow me to briefly introduce myself."

"My surname is Chen, given name Jessica. I'm from..."

"No need!" William impatiently waved his hand to cut me off before I could finish.

"We've met now. We're not compatible. Get off the plane."

At that moment, I almost thought there was something wrong with my ears.

I had gone through layers of approval from my agency superiors to take even half a day off. We had barely met, and he wouldn't even let me finish introducing myself before telling me to leave?

He was clearly treating me like an idiot!

Thinking about this, my temper immediately flared up.

"You must be William Smith, the man my dad set me up with for this arranged date, right?"

"Isn't it a bit rude to not even let me finish speaking before asking me to leave?"

Hearing my words, William let out a derisive laugh.

"Manners? Why don't you take a look in the mirror - do you really think you're worthy of me?"

He glanced at me disdainfully.

"I don't know what my dad was thinking, wanting me to marry some trophy wife like you."

With those words, the crowd erupted once again.

"What? This girl is actually Mr. Smith's fiancée? This is unbelievable!"

"A country bumpkin like her who's never seen the world, dreaming of marrying into a rich family? She should take a good look at herself and see if she's worthy."

"Mr. Smith is the most eligible bachelor in Bay City. I, Lily Roberts, will be the first to object to this marriage!"

As the murmurs from the crowd grew louder, I was a bit bewildered.

When did I ever say I wanted to marry him?

Even if I did want to, it would still require approval from my superiors!

"Alright, alright. I'm a trophy wife, you're the young master. Happy now?" I said.

"Since Mr. Smith isn't interested in me, I'll just leave. However..."

I suddenly changed my tone.

"This first class seat was reserved in advance by my agency. It's not something just anyone can sit in."

I had barely finished speaking when Yasmin immediately stepped forward.

"You little bitch, trying to act high and mighty in front of Mr. Smith, huh?"

"The entire plane belongs to the Smith family. What right do you have to refuse?"

Seeing this scene, I finally understood the true meaning of the word "bootlicker".

"Ms. Zhang, I just want to sit in my own seat. What does it matter who owns the plane?"

As soon as I finished speaking, William immediately became displeased and took out his phone.

"It's just a first class ticket. I'll pay ten times the price!"

"I'll give you $100,000. Now disappear and don't let me see you again!"

I curled my lips into a smile.

"Well, since Mr. Smith is being so sincere, I suppose I'll have to reluctantly accept."

Just as I was about to turn around, Ms. Zhang suddenly shouted at me.

"Stop right there, you little bitch!"

I paused mid-step and slowly turned back.

"What's the matter? Has Ms. Zhang changed her mind?"

Yasmin gave me a sinister smile and whispered something in William's ear.

The next second, this so-called youngest billionaire in Bay City exploded in anger.

"You Chen, how dare you lay hands on my people?"
