From Yasmin's expression, I guessed she must have said quite a few bad things about me to William.

I have to say, her tactic of using others to attack me was flawless.

Based on the first impression William had of me, I knew that no amount of explanation would work. I simply couldn't be bothered to waste my breath.

"Whether I laid hands on her or not doesn't matter anymore. Just tell me what you want to do about it."

William seemed surprised that I was so unapologetic. There was a hint of astonishment in his eyes.

"What else can be done? You need to apologize of course!"

I raised an eyebrow slightly, a faint smile on my lips.

"An apology is definitely not happening. Why don't you come up with another solution?"

"One million dollars!" Yasmin exclaimed gleefully, stepping forward.

"As Mr. Smith's personal assistant, I handle multi-million dollar deals in minutes."

"Just because you pushed me earlier, I'm feeling unwell now. You have to take responsibility!"

Hearing Yasmin's words, the onlookers around us gasped in shock.

Even William himself seemed surprised.

"Ms. Zhang, isn't a million dollars a bit much?" he asked.

"Even if you went to the hospital for a full body check-up, it wouldn't cost nearly that much."

Yasmin immediately waved her hand.

"No, no, no, Mr. Smith. You're thinking too narrowly."

"As your personal assistant, I was assaulted on your family's own plane. It's not just my face that's been lost!"

"Asking for just a million in compensation is already being merciful to her."

William pondered for a moment, feeling there was some logic to it, and nodded slightly.

"Fine! A million it is. I'll pay it!"

I didn't give them time to reconsider and immediately agreed.

"Alright, I accept."

With those words, the eyes of everyone on the plane focused on me.

Some thought I was putting on airs. Some suspected I was playing dumb to catch them off guard. The rest were just gloating.

But these opinions didn't matter much to me.

What mattered was that someone was trying to steal my seat.

Although they offered over ten times the price, their attitude really pissed me off.

"Now that we've settled the pushing incident, shall we discuss the seat issue?" I asked.

Suddenly changing tack, I couldn't help but smirk.

"My itinerary was reported to the airline. Did you think just anyone could sit here?"

As soon as I finished speaking, laughter erupted around us.

"Has this girl lost her mind? It's just a first class seat, who needs to report that to anyone?"

"Exactly! The entire airline belongs to the Smith family. Who else could she possibly report to?"

I coldly swept my gaze across the crowd before slowly speaking.

"Everyone seems to think the Smith family is so wealthy and powerful that they can buy out an entire airline, right?"

"Well then, I'd like to know - can Mr. Smith make the plane stop?"

I grinned.

"He can't... but I can!"
