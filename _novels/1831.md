My husband is a stuffy traditionalist, the kind of man who refuses to sleep with me.
To keep this she-wolf at bay, he buttons his pajamas up to the very top button every night and even tucks a Bible under my pillow before we go to sleep.
I’d finally had enough and was about to file for divorce when a string of comments suddenly materialized before my eyes:
【Poor Dragon Lord, about to be abandoned right in the middle of his heat.】
【This side character is so blind. He’s not putting a Bible under your pillow, it’s The Art of Seduction: 108 Positions!】
【Why don’t you just touch him? The Dragon Lord’s cock is about to explode! If he wasn’t so scared of freaking you out, he would have taken you hard a long time ago!】
I froze, pulling back the divorce papers I was about to hand him.
Then, I reached out and grazed his abs.

1
The man’s expression was indifferent, his amber eyes watching me calmly.
“What are you doing?”
His voice was as cool and detached as ever.
The floating comments continued to scroll past:
【Is the male lead a ninja? How can he hold back like this? It’s the third day of his heat!】
【It’s not his fault! He’s just terrified of scaring her off, so he’s forcing himself to be a perfect gentleman. He’s hopelessly in love with her.】
【No wonder she thinks he doesn’t like her. Tonight she’s going to storm off to a club to find a male model and get caught! That’s how the male lead and the female lead finally meet.】
Getting caught with a male model?
Don’t just make stuff up that hasn’t even happened!
I casually shifted my gaze away from the comments.
“N-nothing. There was just a smudge on your shirt. I was just wiping it off for you.”
Arthur Price didn’t say a word, just stared at me for so long I started to think he’d figured out I was planning to divorce him.
Nervous, I was about to crumple the divorce papers in my hand when I saw him grab his bathrobe and head into the bathroom.
My heart sank.
I barely touched him, and he had to go wash himself? Is he really that repulsed by me?
But the comments were going wild:
【Silly girl, he’s not washing you off, he’s… hehehe…】
【OMG! He finally lost it! She just touched him and he’s already in the shower taking a cold one.】
【Ah! He’s in there whispering her name!】
My face flushed. Was this a comment section or a peep show?
An hour later, Arthur emerged from the bathroom, his voice much clearer.
“There’s a charity gala hosted by the Landon Group tonight. You’re coming with me.”
I frowned. “I don’t think so…”
Those events are always so boring and exhausting.
Arthur reached out and grabbed my sleeve, his tone softening into something almost like a plea.
“Just this once.”
The comments exploded:
【Aww, he’s lowering himself to ask her, but she’s still going to refuse and go find that model!】
【The Dragon Lord, abandoned during his heat, only to find his wife with another man. He’ll be heartbroken, and that’s when the female lead comes in to save him. Their love story starts tonight!】
【Just agree! If you don’t, it’s game over for you two tonight!】
【Not only game over, but without his protection, his other admirers are going to torture her half to death.】
A shiver ran down my spine. The refusal on the tip of my tongue took a sharp turn.
“Fine. I’ll humor you this time.”
The comments went nuts:
【Wait, what? How did she agree?】
Arthur seemed to let out a quiet sigh of relief.
Before, I would never have noticed.
But now, a comment reading, “A dragon’s Adam’s apple is an erogenous zone,” emboldened me to take a closer look.
And that’s when I saw it.
The corners of his eyes were tinged with red, a stark contrast to his usual cool demeanor. A suspicious, feverish heat seemed to radiate from his entire body.
On a whim, I reached out and touched his Adam’s apple.
Arthur shuddered violently, his breath catching in his throat. His Adam’s apple bobbed, and a low groan rumbled from his chest.
“You… you…”
Startled, I snatched my hand back. “I’m sorry! If you don’t like it, I won’t touch you again!”
This was the complete opposite of the “tail-wagging-for-pets” reaction the comments described!

2
The comments fired off in a rapid stream:
【Do you even know how to touch a man? If not, let me! That’s not him disliking it, that’s him getting turned on!】
【Arthur’s inner thoughts: My wife touched my throat! She touched me! Is this my chance to finally become a dad?!】
I looked skeptically from the comments to Arthur.
The next second, he grabbed my hand and pressed it firmly against his neck, his voice muffled.
“I like it.”
My jaw nearly hit the floor.
At my core, I’m a shameless simp for a handsome face.
The first time I saw Arthur Price three years ago, I was completely smitten. A year ago, when I heard the Price family was arranging a marriage, I fought my way through a sea of heiresses to marry into his family.
Who knew that after tying the knot, I’d be living like a widow?
The man either slept in the study or a guest room. On the rare occasion he came to our bedroom, he kept an entire galaxy’s worth of distance between us.
If it were just that, I could have tolerated it.
After all, getting to see Arthur’s handsome face every day was a blessing in itself.
But for the past few nights!
He kept pulling me into his arms in his sleep, mumbling someone else’s name.
“Treasure, Treasure,” he’d whisper, over and over.
My name is Nina, damn it, not Treasure!
I couldn't take it anymore. This morning, I was dead set on divorce.
But now…
I looked at the man whose face was beet red from a single touch.
I stroked my chin with my free hand. Maybe I could hold out for a few more days.
Based on these comments, we might actually sleep together soon.
And I’m supposed to just hand him over to some “female lead” at a time like this?
Not a chance in hell.
Arthur’s body was rigid, a flash of embarrassed anger on his cool face.
“Don’t do that…”
He lowered his eyes, his puppy-dog gaze looking a little misty.
“Stroking my chin like that… it’s like petting a dog. It’s humiliating.”
I snatched my hand back, forcing a laugh.
“Sorry, I zoned out. Would you believe I meant to stroke my own chin?”
Arthur’s brow furrowed, his expression turning stormy.
“Zoned out? Thinking about another man in front of me again?”
His gaze was intense.
“I saw you touching someone else the other day. Why won’t you touch me?”
“Even if I don’t like it, you can’t just… not touch me…”
He pressed his lips together, swallowing the rest of his sentence.
I was surprised by how much he was talking today, but also a little baffled.
“You say you don’t like it, but you’re insisting that I touch you?”
“What the hell do you want?!”
The comments sighed:
【She’s just impossible. Pushing him right into the female lead’s arms one step at a time.】
My crude words sent Arthur storming off.
The comments lamented:
【And with that, he’s gone. By the time they see each other again, everything will have changed.】

3
【I really ship them. If only she could read minds, they wouldn’t have all these misunderstandings.】
【She’s so clueless. No matter how hot the models are, are they hotter than Arthur? More handsome? Do they last longer?】
How would I know if he lasts long? We’ve never even done it.
And who said I was going to find a male model?
I was going to march right into that kitchen and make my darling husband a bento box.
Then I’d take it straight to his office.
I was going to see for myself if this guy was really the volcano of passion the comments claimed, ready to erupt from a single touch.
While I was cooking, my dad called.
“Sweetheart, I hear Arthur is taking you to the gala tonight?”
“Mhm,” I said, arranging cooked corn kernels into a heart shape.
My dad’s voice was earnest.
“Honey, maybe don’t go out carousing tonight, okay?”
“And delete some of those guys from your phone. You don’t need so many contacts.”
I paused. I remembered going out for drinks with friends a few days ago. I had indeed added a lot of new contacts.
“Okay, Dad, I know.”
“Gotta go, I’m making a special bento for Arthur. I have to deliver it soon.”
Maybe it was the thrill of my long-held crush finally seeing the light of day, but my hands were shaking by the time I got to the Price Corporation building.
Suddenly, the comments started up again:
【Why is she here now? If I remember correctly, the female lead is applying for the secretary position today. She’s probably in Arthur’s office right now.】
【This is going to be a train wreck of epic proportions. I can’t watch…】
Not on my watch!
I quickened my pace into the building.
Just as I was about to get on the elevator, the receptionist stopped me.
“Hello, do you have an appointment?”
An appointment?
“No, but I’m—”
The receptionist cut me off before I could finish.
“Without an appointment, you’ll have to wait in the lobby. I can schedule one for you.”
Another receptionist sneered.
“Ashley, don’t be so soft. We get women throwing themselves at Mr. Price all the time.”
“Why book her an appointment? If you ask me, we should just throw out anyone trying to sleep her way to the top.”
The woman called Ashley frowned.
“Don’t be rude.”
I sighed and pulled out my phone to call Arthur’s executive assistant, Mr. Davis.
“I’m at the front desk. Could you come get me?”
Two minutes later, to the utter shock of the receptionists, I was riding the private executive elevator with Mr. Davis.
As we reached the office, before we even went in, I could hear voices from inside.
A delicate female voice cried out.
“Mr. Price, what’s wrong?”
“Oh my god, you’re burning up! Do you need help?”

Arthur’s cool voice followed, laced with exhaustion.
“No. Don’t touch me. Just get out.”
The sound of shattering glass, then the woman’s voice rose.
“How can I leave you alone like this? Don’t worry, I’ll take you to the hospital.”
Arthur’s voice was now thick with anger.
“I said don’t touch me. Get away from me.”
Mr. Davis glanced at me, his expression awkward, but he pushed the door open for me.
The room was a mess. A woman with flushed cheeks was holding onto Arthur’s arm.
When her gaze fell on me, her pretty, doe-like eyes filled with a timid fear. She spoke demurely.
“Mr. Price is sick. As a secretarial candidate, it’s my duty to take care of him.”
Mr. Davis’s face hardened. He went over and supported Arthur himself.
“You haven’t passed the interview yet. You’re not needed here. Please leave.”
Arthur looked terrible. The hair at his temples was soaked with sweat.
He looked at me, tried to speak, but only managed a pained grunt.
Mr. Davis called to me.
“Mrs. Price, please, come closer.”
“Mr. Price… he needs you right now.”
I hesitated, feeling like something was about to happen if I got any closer.
But then I thought, what’s the worst that could happen? We end up sleeping together right here?
Isn’t that why I married him in the first place?
What was I so afraid of?
I gave myself a mental pep talk, took Mr. Davis’s place, and supported Arthur.
His body was terrifyingly hot. The moment I touched him, he wrapped his arms around me, pulling me into a tight embrace.
He rested his chin on my shoulder, his breathing ragged and chaotic.
Mr. Davis closed the door and left.
Arthur shifted restlessly against me, like a big, miserable dog.
【What’s happening? Did he just kick the female lead out?】
【Isn’t helping him with his heat the female lead’s job? Why is the side character doing it?】
【The side character is fine too! Is this train about to leave the station? Go for it! Don’t let that dragon get away!】
My body was stiff. I didn’t dare move.
“Um, I brought you lunch. Are you hungry? Want a bite?”
【I can’t with her. He wants to eat you, you idiot.】
【Stop asking if he wants to eat and kiss him now! Only a wild, passionate f*ck can satisfy him.】
【Are you guys crazy? If she satisfies him, what happens to the female lead? The main couple is the OTP!】
【Who cares about the OTP! I just want some smut, or my VIP subscription is a waste! Go, girl, go!】
The comments were making me antsy. My inhibitions were crumbling. I was just about to grab Arthur’s face and kiss him when he pushed me away, his expression screaming stay away from me.
“Sorry. I’ll handle this myself. I won’t hold you like that again.”
I flared up. He held me, he rubbed against me, and now he was saying he wouldn’t do it again?
What was that supposed to mean? Was I not good enough to hold?
“Fine. Should I go get that secretary for you?” I shot him a sidelong glance, waiting for his answer.
Suddenly, I felt something cold and scaly slithering around my calf.
I looked down and almost fainted.

A thick, black dragon tail, its scales shimmering in the sunlight.
My hand trembled as I pointed.
“Y-y-you…”
Do monsters not even bother to hide anymore?
Wrapping his tail around me in broad daylight?
Arthur’s body went rigid for a second. He reached down to grab his tail.
“Sorry, I…”
I wasn’t listening anymore.
It was terrifying. The tail was so creepy, and Arthur’s eyes had turned into vertical, dark green slits.
For a moment, I thought I was seeing Godzilla.
I turned to run, but he yanked me back.
The dragon tail wrapped around my ankle again, and Arthur’s scorching body pressed against my back.
His voice was hoarse and pleading, like a wet, pathetic puppy.
“Don’t be afraid of me. Please.”
【Wasn’t he supposed to reveal his S-form tonight? Why is it happening now…】
【His soft, sweet wife is right there. He couldn’t hold it in anymore.】
【This is what you get for being so repressed all the time. Now you’ve blown your cover and scared your wife half to death.】
【Does this mean we’re getting an office play scene? I’m waiting!】
I stood frozen, trying to soothe him.
“I didn’t see anything. I won’t tell anyone. Just don’t…”
Before I could finish, sharp teeth grazed the skin on my neck.
It didn’t hurt, just tickled.
I was even more terrified.
“Don’t scare me. Put the teeth away.”
“I’m just a normal person. I can’t handle you taking a bite out of me.”
How could he be so cruel? I just wanted to sleep with him, and he wanted to kill me.
His ragged breathing hitched. The pressure on my neck disappeared.
Arthur let me go, steadied his breathing, and said softly,
“Go. I won’t force you.”
I bolted.
I’ve been afraid of Godzilla since I was a kid.
I thought, based on the comments, that lust would conquer fear.
Arthur was so ridiculously handsome, I could have accepted him being a dragon.
But after today, I was done.
His tail comes out and I start shaking. How is this supposed to work?
It’s not!
【Wait, what? You’re just going to leave him like that?】
【He couldn’t even control his S-form! Leaving him now is like a death sentence!】
【If a shifter in heat doesn’t get relief, it’s really dangerous. They can get a high fever, even have seizures.】
I stopped in my tracks, my heart twisting in indecision.
Arthur… was in danger?
Maybe… I should go back and check on him?
I turned and started walking back to his office.
The comments erupted:
【Here we go, here we go! The iconic scene is about to happen!】
【I just hope when she sees it, she doesn’t blame him.】

6
In the end, I didn’t go back. Because the comments told me exactly what the “iconic scene” was.
【He’s in there right now, masturbating to her picture.】
【Don’t blame him! It’s the only way he can get any relief right now.】
【Even though the scene is censored, just the text description is so hot, I can’t take it.】
I couldn’t take it either. I slapped my forehead and hurried out of the Price building.
My phone kept buzzing. It was messages from the male model I’d added a few days ago.
【Hey, gorgeous. Are you going to the Price gala tonight?】
【I’ve missed you so much since we last met. I wish I’d met you sooner.】
【You mentioned last time that your husband can’t get it up. I remember.】
【I brought some pills this time. I guarantee you’ll be satisfied~】
I frowned.
That didn’t sound right. When had I ever told an outsider that Arthur couldn’t perform?
The most I’d said was that he was cold and made me sleep alone every night.
I checked the contact name. A model named Cody.
Didn’t ring a bell.
Whatever. At a time like this, who cares who he was? Delete.
【My husband is great, actually. I’ve turned over a new leaf. Don’t contact me again.】
I still didn’t know if Arthur was “great,” but his tail and fangs certainly were.
If he ever found out I was texting male models behind his back, he’d never let me live it down.
I didn’t need that kind of trouble.
As I left the building, I saw a beautiful, fragile-looking woman standing by the entrance.
When she saw me, she immediately glided over.
“Hello, Mrs. Price. I’m here to apply for the position of Mr. Price’s secretary.”
She held out her hand, her posture a little arrogant.
I paused, then shook it, giving it a firm squeeze.
Bianca winced, her pretty face contorting for a second.
I felt much better.
Revenge is a dish best served immediately.
That’s what you get for being so high and mighty. I could crush you.
Bianca gritted her teeth, her tone mocking.
“Mrs. Price, if I were you, I’d have a little self-awareness.”
“I hear you’ve been married for a year and still sleep in separate beds? It’s obvious Mr. Price has no interest in you.”
“Someone from a no-name family like yours might have the title of Mrs. Price, but you won’t hold onto it for long.”
I gave her a strange look.
“Who told you my family is no-name? My dad’s company has an annual net worth in the billions.”
She fell silent, her face a mask of disbelief. She opened her mouth to argue.
I pinched her mouth shut.
“Quiet. My head is a mess right now. I don’t have time for your games.”
“And for the record, Arthur likes me a lot. He was just holding me and calling me his darling baby a minute ago.”
Bianca muffled a protest, her face turning red with anger.
I fished a business card out of my pocket.
“You seem qualified. Don’t waste your time chasing after one man.”
“Come work for my company. I’ll double your salary. Think about it and call me anytime.”
