At the family estate's entrance, I knew he was acting. He didn't really want to hold my hand. But hearing him call me 'wife' made my heart race a little.
As soon as we stepped into the living room, "We've waited from the beginning of the year to the end, and the third child finally brings his wife home to meet us?"
Jasper was the third child in the family. He probably married me to avoid an arranged marriage. Jasper pulled out a slight smile, "Mom, I didn't want to disturb your peace."
"You mean you didn't want me to disturb yours." The middle-aged woman, draped in a shawl, sneered, looking at me. "Miss Adeline, right? Come and have a cup of tea." But there was no tea in front of her.
She meant for me to make it. Just as I was about to stand, my wrist was held down. Jasper leaned back in his chair, playing with my fingertips, "With two maids standing by, does she have to do it?"
"Can't I want a cup of tea made by my daughter-in-law?"
"Of course, but my wife isn't for serving." Stop acting... I damn well like you even more.
