Dreams are always nonsensical. One moment, I was heartbroken and suppressed.
The next, I dreamed of pulling up a radish. The bedroom light suddenly turned on. Still immersed in the dream, I mumbled, "Why can't I pull it out..."
Jasper took a deep breath, "Open your eyes and see what you're doing."
Just as I was about to open my eyes, a warm hand grasped my wrist and moved it away. Jasper got up and went to the bathroom, not waiting for me to speak.
He said in a cold voice, "Keep causing trouble, and you'll sleep on the floor." "..."
He's really fierce.
