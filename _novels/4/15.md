Under the moonlight, his eyes were very dark. I saw myself in them. I whispered, "You probably dare." Jasper seemed surprised by my words, gently tapping my knee with his finger. After a while, his Adam's apple bobbed slightly, and he shifted his gaze, "No protection." "..." I then realized we weren't talking about the same thing. The light finally came back on. I stood up in a panic, palms a bit sweaty, "Rogue."
I said, escaping into the bathroom. Coming out, Jasper was still at the computer. The sleeves of his white shirt were rolled up, his side profile sharp and refined.
As if he'd forgotten what just happened. I felt uneasy. In the dead of night, once again sharing a bed. After his shower, he came out.
I instinctively pulled the blanket a bit. "Don't worry, I won't touch you." His tone was light. I couldn't tell if he was reassuring me or telling me not to get my hopes up.
I turned my back on him in anger. "Turn off the lights; it's too bright, and I can't get used to it." Jasper, being obedient, said, "You sleep first."
I snorted, "Don't worry, I won't touch you either."
After hastily finishing my sentence, I dashed into the bathroom.
When I emerged, Jasper was still seated in front of the computer. His white shirt sleeves were rolled up, highlighting his sharp profile.
It was as though he had completely forgotten the earlier conversation. I felt a pang of discomfort.
The night was quiet, and once again, we shared a bed. After his shower, he came out, and I instinctively pulled the covers up.
"Don't worry, I won't touch you," he said with an indifferent tone. It was hard to tell if he was trying to reassure me or make me abandon any hope.
Annoyed, I turned my back to him. "Please turn off the lights; it's too bright for me."
Jasper complied, "You can sleep first."
I scoffed, "Don't worry, I won't touch you either."
"Well, once you're asleep, who knows."
My ears burned red as I recalled the sensation from last night, something I struggled to control.
...
Jasper always seemed busy, often returning home late when I was already asleep. On the phone, my best friend was incredulous, "How can you sleep next to such a handsome guy and not do anything?"
I whispered, "He doesn't seem to like me."
"If he did, he would have made a move on your wedding night. You know, sometimes love and family grow with time."
I hung up, realizing she had a point. I might not win his heart, but I should at least try to experience something with him.
Lost in thought, the department manager called me over, "These are documents Mr. Jasper needs delivered, Miss Adeline. Could you please take them over for me? Thanks a lot." He handed me the documents and left.
Over the years, I've faced many humiliations, one after another. But I took a deep breath; once I get the ten million, I'll quit immediately!
The location was just at the hotel across the street, and I could see Jasper. As I counted the room numbers, a woman opened the door. She was wrapped in a bath towel and, seeing the documents in my hand, said understandingly, "My boyfriend just stepped out. You're his employee, right?"
In that moment, I forgot how I felt. Numbly nodding, I handed over the documents and turned to leave, my steps unsteady and my mind blank. I wanted to call and ask him something, but I realized I had no right to interfere in his private life. After all, our marriage was fake from the beginning.
I felt a rush of sadness and wanted to cry. To ease the pain, I went to a bar and hired a couple of male escorts. My best friend had to cancel last minute and advised me over the phone to take it easy and not let things get out of hand tonight. But I couldn't hear anything.
My phone lit up again. Jasper was asking, [Where are you?]
I pretended not to see it, but after a few seconds, I replied anyway, [Working overtime]
[Thank you for your hard work.]
Such a considerate reply. I felt a bit emotional and typed back fiercely, [Good thing you know!]
[Hmm, should I come toast a drink to you?]
...
I suddenly looked up, neon lights flickering before my eyes, and sighed with relief. Jasper was likely cozied up somewhere and wouldn't be here.
As I withdrew my gaze, I glanced casually and locked eyes with the man not far away. Jasper stood in the shadows, a faint red glow at his fingertips.
In his suit, tall and long-legged, he took a drag of his cigarette. Through the smoke, his gaze was emotionless as it fell on me. At that moment, I had a male escort on each side, one pouring wine, the other feeding me fruit.
In a daze, Jasper leisurely stubbed out his cigarette and walked over slowly. The escorts sensed trouble, "Violet, who is he? He looks so fierce."
I suddenly didn't know how to explain. The escorts wouldn't let up, "Aren't we enough? Did you call another one, Violet, speak up, Violet."
Jasper turned his head, "Try calling one more."
The escorts shrank back, too scared to speak. I awkwardly stood up, feeling a bit dizzy, "Let's go home..."
Jasper looked amused, "Where do I sleep this time?"
"Don't worry, you won't have to sleep in the middle."
He laughed angrily, "So you've rearranged things for me, huh."
His expression turned cold as he grabbed my wrist, leading me to the door. I struggled, equally angry, "You're allowed to have a girlfriend, but I can't have fun? You have to let me make mistakes too."
Mistakes, indeed. He frowned, "What girlfriend?"
"She's all showered and waiting for you!"
The phone rang. Jasper answered it, and as he paid the bill, he also covered the cost of the escorts I had hired. Such a nice guy, so generous. After hanging up, he sent a message on the screen, then looked at me, "Who taught you to make such a fuss?"
I got into the car, "Who's really making a fuss!"
Jasper sighed inwardly, choosing not to argue, "You're drunk, stop it."
The phone rang again. It was my department manager, Zane. As soon as I answered, he was angrily scolding, "I told you to deliver the document to 913, where did you send it? The business partner is still waiting in the conference room, and Mr. Jasper is urging, if you don't want to work, just leave tomorrow!"
I was already in a bad mood, drunk, and spoke without thinking, "You're just a scapegoat always shirking responsibility! You clearly told me to send it to 319..."
After saying that, I paused, realizing I might have misunderstood something. The voice on the other end was clearly confused, "Iris Adeline, you're something, I ask you to do one thing and you throw a fit, if I were Mr. Jasper, I'd fire you right away!"
I impulsively said, "He's right here, tell him yourself."
It was on speaker. My head was dizzy, leaning against the car window, resting my eyes. The person next to me had a deep and pleasant voice. In my haze, it felt like a dream. I heard him say---if you speak to her like that again, you'll be packing your things and leaving.
...
It started raining. When I woke up, we were home. I didn't open my eyes, and Jasper didn't wake me. He wrapped his arm around my waist and carried me.
His chest was warm with a hint of moisture. I couldn't help but open my eyes a crack, quietly watching him, strangely reminded of him in high school. In the cafeteria, on the sports field, even in the store when we brushed past each other.
Those memories stayed with me for many years. Maybe my gaze was too intense, like I was looking through him at someone else. Jasper suddenly stopped, lowered his eyes, "Who are you looking at?"
My face was flushed, murmuring, "Someone I like."
His fingers tightened on my waist for a moment. Jasper's eyes turned cold, perhaps remembering the love letter I was looking for last time. He placed me on the bed, pinched my chin, forcing me to look at him. "Iris Adeline."
"Hmm."
"Look closely," he said in a deep voice, "I'm not him."
...
The memory of the hangover was fragmented. Jasper got up half an hour earlier than me. Washing up, changing clothes. Neither of us spoke first. It felt like an unspoken cold war.
I asked about the important matter, "What about the document I delivered wrong last night, is it important?"
Jasper was tying his tie, and in the morning light, his face looked even more handsome. Some people, just standing there, can provide emotional value. He said, "It's the project promotion plan, it's fine."
I was relieved. Jasper glanced at me, "Nothing else to say?"
Thinking of last night's awkward misunderstanding, I shook my head, wanting to leave, "Nothing."
As I was about to pass by, he held my arm for a moment. He sighed, "During our marriage, I won't do anything to betray you."
I took a few seconds to react, fearing he'd bring up the male models, "Got it, I'll head downstairs first."
Jasper didn't let go, thinking I was still angry, "Really, no girlfriend."
His eyes were dark. His tone coaxing. My thoughts slowed, suddenly feeling a bit envious of the girl who occupied his youth. This person is gentle and restrained. Being in a relationship with him must be a delightful thing. "Are you explaining to me?"
Jasper paused, wanting to ask, "What do you think?"
Silence between us. He continued looking at me, not sure what he was thinking. I stood awkwardly, also asking, "What are you thinking?"
Jasper leaned against the wardrobe, a faint smile on his lips, "Thinking if you get drunk, do you like to kiss people randomly."
I didn't kiss him last night, did I?
Zane seemed to know something shocking. Today he was extra attentive, offering two hot drinks as an apology. I didn't want to engage, thinking all day about when I might have kissed Jasper.
That night, there was a dinner gathering. The business partner was hosting. I was involved in the project, so I was naturally invited. Jasper arrived late.
He sat right next to me. Zane, ever the opportunist, used the chance to bond with me over drinks.
The business partner jokingly asked if he had a thing for me, being so attentive. Zane shook his head repeatedly, glancing at Jasper, "Miss Adeline has a boyfriend."
I was stunned, not wanting more misunderstandings, I explained, "No, I'm single."
The table fell silent for half a second. Then the laughter resumed. The business partner smoothed things over, "Young people these days focus on their careers, marrying late.
But Mr. Jasper, you should hurry up, almost thirty, let me introduce my daughter to you sometime."
Jasper remained unreactive throughout, smiling, "Sorry, I'm married."
In an instant, some were surprised, some were confused. Zane was the latter, his gaze at me changing multiple times. Finally turning disdainful.
Our marriage agreement was mutual, not public. Now, something felt off. I couldn't pinpoint what was wrong. I glanced at Jasper next to me, sending him a message.
[Mr. Jasper, what do you mean?]
The screen lit up, Jasper glanced at his phone. But showed no intention of opening it. I anxiously nudged him with my knee. Jasper finally, generously, replied.
[Don't want to meet his daughter.]
So that's it. I lowered my gaze
