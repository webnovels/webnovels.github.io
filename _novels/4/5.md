I didn't see Jasper again after that. I heard he went abroad for business. Living in a mansion with a husband who was never home was quite relaxing for me.
Late at night, I heard the sound of an engine downstairs.
After seven months, Jasper was back. He slept in the guest room. I relaxed and turned over, then suddenly opened my eyes wide.
Last night, I had drunk too much and fell asleep in the guest room.
I had even taken out the love letter I wrote to him when I was young to read, and it was still there.
