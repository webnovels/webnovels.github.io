The Aiden family children are usually busy. So it's a rule that they must come back for a meal and stay overnight once a month. The dining table was cold and quiet. This house didn't feel like a home; it was oppressive and serious. In the bedroom, I was nervous again, "I can sleep in the guest room." "That would be a breach of contract."
The contract stated that if Party B caused others to find out it was a fake marriage, Party B owed Party A five million. I changed the subject, "Do you have a lot of conflicts with your mother?" Jasper, not done with his work, replied dismissively, "Are you into me?
Want to save me?" "Didn't the woman you spent seven months with save you?" He laughed, "If I had someone I liked, why would I marry you?" "..." He said he didn't have anyone he liked now.
I felt a bit disappointed.
I opened my mouth to speak. Suddenly, everything went dark. Later, I heard it was because the second brother and his wife were fighting next door.
A cup of water spilled into the electrical outlet, causing a blackout on the entire second floor. By then, I was already startled and ended up sitting on Jasper's lap.
