Seeing his smug, disgusting expression of getting what he wanted, I struggled through the pain to get up from the ground and sneered back:

"You know exactly what you've done, Ryan Miller. Your retribution will come sooner or later!"

A flash of wariness crossed Ryan's eyes, but he quickly adopted a righteous tone, pointing at me accusingly,

"Jack Thompson, don't try to implicate others! I'm not like you. I would never betray my colleagues! Let alone become a traitor! You've disgraced our entire team, our whole country!"

I laughed bitterly, too tired to argue with him, and slowly started to move away despite the pain.

But Ryan wouldn't let it go. He came forward and grabbed me, touching my wound and making me wince in pain. Before I could react, he suddenly fell on his butt and started wailing like a bad actor.

Rachel, who had been keeping a straight face until now, instantly panicked. She took two big steps, pushing me aside, and anxiously helped Ryan up from the ground, gently patting his back and comforting him softly. Seeing he wasn't hurt, Rachel glared at me angrily, "Well, Jack Thompson, your parents worked hard to put you through twenty years of school, and this is what you learned? Betraying your country and deliberately hurting people? Apologize to Ryan right now!"

I laughed coldly, but before I could speak, Ryan whined pitifully, adding fuel to the fire, "I just wanted to see if Jack was being wrongly accused. He just misunderstood me, he didn't mean to push me."

But Rachel's face darkened, "There's no misunderstanding. He's getting what he deserves now!"

I had no outlet for my anger, and all I could manage was a flat statement, "You know who really deserves punishment."

Rachel's face, which I once loved to death, now seemed completely unfamiliar to me.

Even if she saw through Ryan's act, even if she was willing to let me bear the label of a traitor and ruin my life, Rachel still chose him without hesitation.

I don't have evidence now, but the truth will come out eventually.

I couldn't be bothered to argue with them anymore. Pressing the bleeding wound on my head, I hurried to leave. Staying with them for another second made me want to vomit.

As I was leaving, Rachel called out, "Jack Thompson, you're a suspect now. You're not allowed to leave the city. Report your whereabouts to me every hour."

Without turning back, I walked out of that dark room, saying, "Fine, but you'd better keep a close eye on Ryan Miller. Otherwise, you might end up in jail or worse!"

Thinking about Rachel's gritting teeth, I felt a secret satisfaction.

She had intended to pressure me into cleaning up after Ryan, but this time I didn't give an inch. She had hit a wall.

And this spy accusation was far more complicated than it appeared on the surface.

After leaving the office, I contacted a real estate agent to list the house I had bought for our marriage.

The agent said that houses in good school districts were in high demand, and she had a buyer willing to pay even more than my asking price.

The price didn't matter to me. What mattered was that anything associated with Rachel now felt like a thorn in my side.

Then I drove straight to the civil affairs bureau and finally got the divorce certificate I had been longing for.

This mutually torturous marriage was finally over!
