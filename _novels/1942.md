I was on a business trip when my neighbor texted to say my husband had brought home some gorgeous woman.

I booked the next flight home.

Derek wasn't there. I tore through the place like a lunatic.

"You slut! Show yourself!"

I bent down to check under the bed and found a bloody corpse.

Her head had been cut off. Her eyes were wide open, staring right at me.

I nearly jumped out of my skin.

That's when I heard footsteps. Derek was coming back!

 
The lock clicked.

My body jolted. On pure instinct, I scanned the room and dived into the closet.

The closet had louvered doors. Through the slats, I could still see that severed head under the bed.

She was wearing heavy smoky eye makeup and theatrical contact lenses.

At first glance, her eyes looked completely black—bulging like they might pop out of their sockets any second.

I clapped a hand over my mouth. My heart thundered so loud I thought it would burst through my ribs.

This wasn't happening. I came to catch him cheating, not walk into a crime scene.

Why would Derek do this?

Did they get into a fight?

Derek had a temper, sure. If our server was slow at restaurants, he'd pound the table.

Picking fights was practically his hobby.

But murder? That's crazy. Did he even think about the consequences?

My thoughts raced as Derek stepped into the bedroom.

He seemed to be in a great mood, carrying a black trash bag and humming cheerfully.

"What a beautiful day, everything's going my way~"

Still humming, he knelt down slowly, set the trash bag beside him, and pulled that head out from under the bed.

He cradled the head in his left hand, tapping the woman's nose playfully with his right.

"You just wouldn't listen, would you?"

His tone was teasing, like they were old flames bantering.

"Look at you. So beautiful. I really did like you."

"I told you to stay put, but you just had to go digging through my stuff."

"You found my secret. What was I supposed to do? You left me no choice."

"We had such a good thing going. Hate to see it end like this."

As he spoke, he leaned in and smacked two loud kisses on the woman's bright red lips.

The metallic stench of blood hit me hard. I gagged, clamping my mouth shut tighter.

I never knew Derek had this side to him.

Kissing a severed head? What the hell?

Was he some kind of psychopath?

And what secret was he talking about?

We'd been married four years. I cleaned this house, organized his life. His phone password was my birthday—I could check it anytime. Never saw anything suspicious!

I stared at Derek's blood-smeared face, contorted into that sick grin. He looked like a total stranger.

He kissed the head a few more times, then went back to humming.

"What a beautiful day, tomorrow's gonna be even better..."

Still humming, he tossed the head into the trash bag, then bent down to drag the woman's body out from under the bed.

That's when I noticed she was naked.

She had an amazing figure—would've been a knockout if she were alive.

But now there was a gaping wound across her slim waist.

Derek reached out and stroked the wound slowly, his face almost mournful.

"What a waste. Didn't want to have to do this so soon."

He went to the kitchen and came back with a meat cleaver.

He knelt on the floor and started dismembering the body with practiced ease.

His movements were smooth, almost elegant.

I could barely hear the bones cracking.

He was completely focused, like an artist admiring his work.

Soon he had both legs separated at the joints, bones laid out neatly, flesh chopped and stuffed into the trash bag.

He stood up and stretched. Suddenly his eyes locked on something. His expression shifted instantly.
