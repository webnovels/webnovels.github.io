Asher, the billionaire CEO, had yet another heated argument with the woman who had always held a special place in his heart.

On the most intense day of their quarrel, Asher made a bold declaration in front of everyone: he was determined to find someone more compliant and sweet than his cherished one.

The very next day, Asher approached me: "Interested in dating? I'll pay you a hundred thousand a month." And so, I stayed by Asher's side, playing the role of his sweet and agreeable girlfriend.

Those around us were curious to see how long this emotional gamble would last. I was waiting too. Yet, three months, then six months passed, and Asher still hadn't ended things with me.

It was on our anniversary that his beloved professed her love with a grand city-wide display of roses. Asher suggested we part ways.

I quietly accepted and immediately flew overseas to pursue my research. Three months later, having successfully completed my project, I returned home.

That night, Asher confronted me at the airport: "Really? I let you go, and you just left, disappearing for three months without a word?"

I smiled. I've always been the most compliant. Since I agreed to break up, I would never look back.
