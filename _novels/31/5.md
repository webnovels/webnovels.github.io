Gabriel came home very late.

His posture was straight, his tailored suit and neatly combed-back hair making his handsome features look somewhat distant and cold.

Those indifferent eyes seemed to melt when they saw me on the sofa.

He smiled as he walked towards me, "It's one in the morning, why aren't you asleep?"

In the past, I would have snuggled into his arms, craving his warmth.

Now, I just felt disgusted.

I avoided his outstretched hand and threw the photo I had been clutching onto the coffee table.

These were the photos he had treasured and hidden in his study.

Of course, he recognized them at a glance.

Gabriel's expression froze, but he managed to maintain a smile.

"You went into my study?" he asked gently.

"Yes."

Gabriel lowered his eyes and silently picked up the photos from the coffee table.

"Don't do it again." His tone was calm, the worst attitude he had ever shown me since our marriage.

I sneered, "There won't be a next time, Gabriel. After all these years together, what exactly did you take me for?"

I stood up, looking up at him.

Time hadn't left any traces on his face; he was still handsome and youthful.

I stared into those seemingly affectionate eyes and saw him frown tiredly.

"Alright, stop making a fuss. Let's go to bed," he sighed, as if yielding.

"You think I'm making a fuss?" I asked.

Gabriel avoided the question: "Sophia, haven't I been good to you?"

Without waiting for my answer, he continued, "I believe I've treated you well. At least in this marriage, I've never wronged you. So, can't you understand that there are some things I can't give you?"

"Some things? You mean love?" I asked.

He remained silent, implicitly agreeing.

I wanted to laugh, but tears welled up instead, "So I'm just a replacement. You've been so good to me, but you've never loved me."

"You're an adult. Love is too luxurious..."

"Am I not worthy?" I interrupted him. I wanted to ask if I, Sophia, wasn't worthy of sincere and passionate love.

Should I be grateful for being a replacement?

Uncontrollable sadness made me cry incessantly. Gabriel brought a warm, damp towel to wipe my tears, his movements gentle.

But I felt even more miserable.

See how gentle he was.

So gentle that he remained calm even as he watched me break down.

In this marriage, I was the only one who had invested my whole heart.
