That night, I had a huge fight with Gabriel.
I didn't even get a chance to appreciate the new bag before I threw it at his face.
"What's the meaning of this? Is your overtime work actually dating other women?"
I was shaking with anger, my eyes red.
Gabriel's expression was cold, but when he looked at me, his eyes were only filled with gentleness and helplessness.
He tried to approach me, but I pushed him away.
"That was your aunt, darling. She just came back from abroad and happens to be cooperating with our company. We were having a business dinner."
"My aunt?"
I was confused. My aunt was back?
My aunt was a free spirit, 33 years old, single, traveling abroad. We hardly ever saw her throughout the year.
She's back? Why didn't she tell me?
Seeing my reaction, Gabriel pulled me into his arms, "Are you still angry?"
I snorted and took out my phone to call my aunt.
The call connected quickly.
The woman's soft voice came through the phone, and I felt Gabriel's body stiffen for a moment.
I glared at him and asked, "Aunt, you're back?"
"Yes, sweetie. I just called your mom. What's up?"
"Aunt, did you have dinner with my husband's company tonight?"
"Yes, I did. It was business, couldn't be postponed. I drank quite a bit and almost tripped crossing the street. How embarrassing! Luckily your husband was there."
My doubts were completely dispelled. I arranged a welcome dinner with my aunt and hung up.
Gabriel held me tightly, "Are you still angry?"
"Hmph!"
I pushed him away and picked up the new bag from the floor, feeling heartbroken about its condition.
Gabriel was still patient, comforting me for a while longer.
Finally, he carried me upstairs.
