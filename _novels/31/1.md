Gabriel spoiled me.

He would give me anything I wanted, and being older, he seemed to have endless patience.

I whined on the phone, "If you're not coming home tonight, I might go out and find other men."

"I have to work late tonight, be good and stay home," Gabriel paused, "Remember that bag you mentioned last time? I've already ordered it, it'll be delivered tonight."

I giggled, "Why do you always try to appease me with bags?"

"Don't you like them?"

His deep, magnetic voice made my heart flutter.

I quickly said I loved it and kept him talking, the atmosphere turning flirtatious.

After four years of marriage, I had truly experienced the benefits of being with an older man.

He was so gentle, I couldn't find a single flaw. Even when I deliberately acted up or caused trouble, he would always soothe me gently.

He had a lot of money and a lot of love, and he gave both to me without hesitation.

My heart was filled with warmth.

Until my best friend told me she saw a woman walking arm in arm with Gabriel across the street.
