The news spread throughout the company that the CEO's fiancée, whom I risked my life to save, is going to marry her idealized love due to her pregnancy. Everyone assumed that I, as the fiancé, would be furious over her marrying someone else.

But even after their child was born, I stayed composed and didn't cause any trouble. Instead, I took initiative and focused on projects to support the struggling company.

The fiancée believed I had finally accepted my role as just a tool to help her manage the company. With a condescending air of self-satisfaction, she promised me, "Since you're so considerate in earning money for me and the baby, I'll reluctantly let you stay in the company and give you a chance to continue taking care of us."

However, she was sorely mistaken. I am not working for her and the child; I'm preparing to take over the company next week.

From now on, I won't compromise and be her supportive partner behind the scenes. I'll replace her and become the new CEO!
