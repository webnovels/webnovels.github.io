Stella ignored him.

She was busy discussing with me about the setup of a new direct-sale brand store she was working on.

Lucas, hearing this, deliberately made a commotion at the dinner table. When we both looked at him, he smiled and said:

"Oh my, you're talking about something I'm quite familiar with. I got a bit excited."

He turned to the puzzled Stella and said, "My ex-wife has a direct-sale brand that's doing quite well. She has many resources that she could share with me. For Ryan's sake, I could help you out."

He then went on to describe the brand in detail. I could see that Stella was very interested.

She looked at me hesitantly, then back at Lucas, and asked:

"Since it's your ex-wife's, wouldn't it be inconvenient?"

"What's inconvenient about it? A quick fling and everything's solved. Just wait for my message."

This time, Stella didn't refuse. I knew her "Do Not Disturb" setting for Lucas was about to be turned off.

Sure enough, when she came into the room later, she said to me, "Your cousin is quite generous and straightforward, isn't he?"

I just looked up at her once, my eyes already half red.

She immediately came over to comfort me: "I was just saying. How could I be interested in a man who's still entangled with his ex-wife?"
