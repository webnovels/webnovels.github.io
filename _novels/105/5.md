Lucas left my apartment the next day, and Stella didn't come back for several days.

She said she was out of town for work, as several direct-sale stores were opening simultaneously.

During our video calls, I could sometimes see Lucas in the background. She quickly explained:

"Your cousin called to ask about my progress. When he heard I was in the neighboring city, he came over to check things out. This time, thanks to your cousin's help, a lot of work was saved. Even my dad praised me."

Second-generation rich kids spend their lives trying to surpass their parents, and Stella was no exception. Especially since she was a girl.

Her father and grandfather were both very successful entrepreneurs. She wasn't bad herself, but she was always overshadowed by her family's legacy. She had always wanted to prove herself.

This time, the direct-sale stores were set up in several cities at once, fast and in good locations. Even her father and grandfather praised her at the dinner table for handling this matter beautifully.

Stella transferred $200,000 to me, saying it was to buy a gift for my cousin in my name.

"I know he helped me because of you. It's better if you give it to him. I still have some sense of propriety."

She added, "Choose something your cousin likes. If it's not enough, I can send more."

I took out my phone and called my brother. As soon as the call connected, I said:

"Thanks for helping my girlfriend. She wants to send you a gift worth about $200,000. Is there anything you like? Or should I just transfer the money to you?"

There was a pause on the other end, then a slightly hoarse female voice came through.

"Ryan? Why is your girlfriend sending Lucas a gift?"

Oh no, Lucas and his ex-wife's contact names only differed by one letter. I had accidentally called his ex-wife, Fiona.

Fiona, Lucas, and I were all alumni. Fiona was a year ahead of us, and we'd run into each other during club activities.

I had only complimented Fiona once on being considerate, and the next day, Lucas started pursuing her ostentatiously.

Two weeks later, they were together. After several breakups and reconciliations, they got married right after graduation.

Three years into the marriage, they divorced.
