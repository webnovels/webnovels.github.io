To prevent this big financial backer, who still sends my brother a monthly allowance, from misunderstanding, I quickly explained:

"No, no, he helped my girlfriend with something big. But we should thank you too. This time, my girlfriend's direct-sale snack brand stores relied entirely on your resources."

"I thought he was finally getting his act together and starting his own business. Turns out it's for your girlfriend. He cares more about her than he ever did about me."

Before I could respond, she continued:

"Alright, I get it. I'll buy him a gift. You keep the money for yourself."
