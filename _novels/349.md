"I was dying.

But nobody cared.

When Jason Sterling came out with his suitcase, I was curled up on the sofa, a skinny little thing bundled in an oversized coat.

His cold, stiff back only turned to glance at me once.

In the silent light, he didn't say a single word.

Then he just left.

My head stayed down for a long time before I finally lifted it.

I looked at the light outside.

It was like the whole world had abandoned me.

My parents didn't want me anymore.

And he thought I was bad to the bone.

I wasn't worth forgiving.

My hand trembled as I touched my stomach.

Just a week ago, there was a four-month-old baby in here.

But it had quietly slipped away.

I was so lonely.

I so desperately wanted a baby of my own, I’d teach her to read, teach her to sing.

Teach her to call me Mommy.

But it would never happen now.

The title of Mrs. Sterling never should have belonged to me in the first place.

This was my punishment for stealing someone else's title.

I leaned helplessly against the back of the couch.

I smiled sadly.

“I don't think I have any strength left.”

I don't know how long I sat there.

Finally, I got up and knocked the photo frame off the table.

Some people say love lasts forever.

But I didn't love him anymore."
