I induced labor early and gave birth to my child, then stuffed pillows under my clothes to pretend I was still pregnant until the day my sister and I were both sent to the delivery room.

It was all because in my previous life, when my sister and I married into the wealthy Gray family together, our mother-in-law promised at the wedding that whoever gave birth to an heir would inherit the entire family fortune.

But after carrying a child for ten months, I unexpectedly gave birth to a black baby, while my sister delivered a healthy, chubby white boy.

My mother-in-law was furious, calling me a shameless whore for cuckolding her son.

"Sister, I can't keep covering up for you anymore about your secret meetings with that black man," my sister said with tears in her eyes, acting as if I had been forcing her to keep quiet all this time.

I struggled desperately to explain, but no one believed me. Even my father spat at me, saying I was born to be a disgrace.

When my enraged mother-in-law locked me in the basement, my sister poured gasoline inside while gloating.

"Your son will have to call me mom from now on. Everything that was yours is mine now!"

When I opened my eyes again, I had returned to the time before giving birth.
