I scrolled through the surveillance footage on my phone, each frame cutting into my heart like a knife.
So while I was struggling alone through morning sickness, James was in another private residence, personally making soup for Emily.
His movements were as gentle as if handling a treasure, even testing the temperature of the soup spoon three times.
In the footage, he wore a custom apron, smiling at the corners of his eyes: "Drink more, it's good for the baby."
Emily snuggled into his arms coquettishly: "Your soup is always the best."
Meanwhile, my nutritional meals were always ordered from outside by his assistant.
Memories rewound like a movie playing backwards.
That day I suddenly craved sour plums and sent him a message.
Three hours later he finally replied: 'In an important meeting, I'll have my assistant send some over.'
Now looking at the surveillance, I realized he was accompanying Emily to a luxury store to pick out baby items.
He crouched down, gently caressing her slightly swollen belly:
"This little dress is so cute. If it's a girl, it would be perfect."
Emily smiled radiantly: "I think it'll be a boy, handsome like you."
"Boy or girl," he dotingly tapped her nose, "as long as it's our child, it's the best."
My fingers unconsciously dug into my palm.
I remembered going to the hospital alone for a check-up, the nurse asking: "Where's your family?"
I smiled and replied: "He's busy with work."
When the results came out, I excitedly took a photo and sent it to him: 'It's a boy!'
He only replied with a simple emoji.
So all his tenderness was given to someone else.
I opened another surveillance clip.
He accompanied Emily for a prenatal check-up, never leaving her side.
"Baby, don't be afraid, I'm here," he gripped her hand tightly. "If it hurts, just squeeze my hand."
Emily nodded with tears in her eyes: "With you by my side, I'm not afraid of anything."
While during my check-ups, I could only ever hear the cold sound of machines.
The most ironic was the day of the gender reveal.
He said he was on a business trip out of town, telling me not to worry.
But in the surveillance footage, he was lying next to Emily in the examination room, eyes fixed on the ultrasound screen.
"It's a boy!" The moment the doctor spoke, he excitedly kissed Emily's forehead.
"That's wonderful," his eyes reddened with emotion. "We have a son."
Emily wiped away tears with a smile: "Do you think he'll look like you?"
"Of course he will," he gently caressed her belly. "He's our child after all."
I turned off my phone, looking out the window.
The sky was gloomy, as if it might rain.
Just like my mood right now.
So from the very beginning, I was just an outsider.
Every bit of tenderness he gave Emily came from his heart.
While what he gave me was nothing but a perfunctory facade.
The nurse came in to change my dressing, seeing my expression, she hesitated to speak.
"Mrs. Wilson..."
"Just call me Sophia," I forced a smile.
From today on, I don't want to be Mrs. Wilson anymore.
She hesitated for a moment before speaking: "Mr. Wilson and that Miss Emily were just in the cafe downstairs..."
"I know," I cut her off. "No need to say more."
I know what they're doing.
No doubt discussing what name to give that unborn child.
James will certainly put a lot of thought into it.
Just like he once promised me.
Too bad those promises were meant for someone else's ears.
I took out my phone and sent Kate a message:
'Prepare divorce papers for me.'
'Also, check their transfer records over the past few years.'
Since he loves Emily so much, let's see if his true love is as pure as he imagines.
Putting down the phone, I touched my flat belly.
I'm sorry, baby.
Mommy couldn't protect you.
But Mommy will definitely make those who hurt you pay the price.
