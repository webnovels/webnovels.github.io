I lay in the hospital bed, watching James busy himself taking care of me.
His movements were gentle, his gaze focused, occasionally using the back of his hand to test the temperature of the food.
This tenderness was like a knife, carving into my heart bit by bit.
"Hungry?" He leaned forward slightly, a doting smile on his lips.
"I had the chef make bird's nest soup, your favorite."
He sat down by the bed holding the bowl, his long fingers gripping the silver spoon.
Carefully blowing on a spoonful to cool it, his eyes fixed unwaveringly on me as he brought the spoon to my lips.
I turned my head away, my hair lightly brushing his fingertips. "I don't want to eat."
"Come on," he sighed, his free hand gently stroking my hair, his voice full of concern.
"You just lost the baby, your body needs nourishment. I'm worried about you, please don't make me more anxious, okay?"
What a perfect performance. His brows furrowed slightly, the corners of his eyes tinged red, even the trembling of his fingers was just right.
If I hadn't heard his words with my own ears, I might have believed him.
Just then, his phone rang.
His eyes flickered for a moment, glancing at the caller ID, his frown deepening:
"There's something at the company. I'll take this call outside."
I nodded, watching him leave.
He deliberately lightened his footsteps as he walked, even closing the door gently.
The moment the door closed, his voice came through the crack.
His previously gentle tone instantly became light and joyful:
"Emily, don't worry, everything's taken care of."
His voice carried undisguised affection, completely different from moments ago.
"Our child will be the Wilson family's only heir. No one can threaten him anymore."
As he said this, there was even a hint of pride in his voice.
"You just focus on the pregnancy. Once you're out of postpartum care, I'll bring you home."
So while I was lying on the operating table fighting for my life, his true love was resting comfortably elsewhere.
I touched my empty belly, my fingertips trembling slightly. A small life had once been growing there.
But now, there was nothing left.
A nurse came in to change my dressing. Her gaze lingered on my face for a few seconds, her eyes full of sympathy:
"Mrs. Wilson, my condolences."
I forced a smile, the curve of my lips just right: "Thank you."
She bit her lip, fidgeting with the hem of her uniform, hesitating before finally speaking in a low voice:
"Actually... the baby could have been saved at first."
I gripped the blanket tightly, my knuckles turning white, the fabric crumpling deeply in my palm.
"I know." My voice was so calm it scared even me.
The nurse was taken aback, her eyes widening slightly, seemingly surprised by my calmness.
She glanced around, as if making sure no one was nearby, before leaning closer to my bed.
"That Emily, she's Mr. Wilson's first love."
Her voice was barely above a whisper, "I heard they broke up years ago because his family opposed it."
Her hands shook slightly as she arranged the medicines on the bedside table: "She came in for a prenatal check-up a few days ago. I attended to her myself."
"She's six months pregnant."
Six months.
I counted on my fingers, my nails unconsciously digging into my palm. It was right when I had just gotten pregnant.
No wonder during that time, James was always making excuses about business trips, occasionally coming home with unfamiliar perfume on his suit.
So he had been with her all along.
I laughed, laughing so hard tears came to my eyes. The nurse nearly dropped the medicine bottle she was holding.
"Mrs. Wilson..."
She looked at me worriedly, awkwardly offering a tissue.
"I'm fine, you can go," I took the tissue, elegantly wiping away my tears.
After she left, I took out my phone, my fingertips lightly tapping the screen, dialing a number.
"Hello, Kate."
My voice was frighteningly calm.
"Help me investigate Emily's whereabouts over the past few years." My fingers unconsciously fiddled with the edge of the blanket.
"And every meeting record between her and James."
Hanging up the phone, I wiped away my tears, a cold smile curling at my lips.
James Wilson, isn't the Wilson family's reputation what you care about most?
Then I'll let the whole world know.
That the mighty CEO of Wilson Group is a scumbag who killed his own flesh and blood for his mistress.
You love Emily the most, don't you?
I'll make you watch her crumble under everyone's contempt.
You took away my child, so I'll leave you with nothing.
Outside the ward, the sun was setting.
The blood-red twilight dyed half the sky, just like that day, when blood stained my skirt.
James pushed open the door, a bouquet of roses in his hand.
His steps were light, a gentle smile on his face, as if the phone call earlier had never happened.
"Honey, don't be too sad." He gently placed the flowers by the bed, his long fingers lightly arranging the petals.
"When you're better, we can try for another one, okay?"
I looked at his concerned gaze, at the fine laugh lines at the corners of his eyes, and suddenly wanted to laugh.
Unfortunately, you'll never have that chance again.
Because from today on, I won't give you any opportunity to get close to me.
For every bit of pain you've given me, I'll make you pay back tenfold.
