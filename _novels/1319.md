I was on the local news when I was born, simply for being too beautiful.

By my first birthday, an embarrassing number of dynastic families were already swarming my parents, requesting a standing arrangement for a future marriage.

When the tenth time a boy was hospitalized after fighting over me, my parents knew we had to move. They reluctantly packed up our lives and began using makeup to conceal my real face.

I finally began to live what felt like a normal life.

It was also the first time I truly felt the sharp, cold malice of the world without the armor of my looks.

The day I was cornered, called a freak, and locked in a derelict storage room behind the gymnasium, I hit rock bottom.

Then, Wyatt climbed in through the window. He took my hand and looked at me with an earnestness that was blinding.

“Aria,” he said, his voice quiet but firm. “Beauty isn’t the only way to judge a person. You are you, and that’s what matters.”

My heart hammered a desperate rhythm against my ribs. He was the first person to truly see me, and I was instantly gone. I worked harder than I ever had, making sure I got into the same university he chose.

When my acceptance letter arrived, I clutched the paper, my hands shaking with nerves, ready to confess my feelings. But before I could speak, he beat me to it.

“Aria, be my girlfriend.”

The rush of pure, unexpected joy drowned me. I felt like the luckiest girl in the world.

For the next three years, Wyatt was everything. He was attentive, thoughtful, and protective. Everyone envied me for having such a handsome and sensitive boyfriend.

Until the annual campus-wide holiday party.

During a round of "Truth or Dare," Wyatt drew the short straw and was dared to pick someone next to him for an impromptu ice-water challenge. The choice was between me and Savannah, the reigning campus queen.

He chose me.

The instant the ice water hit my head, my heart froze solid.

1

The bone-numbing chill ran from my scalp down to the soles of my feet. I gasped, shivering uncontrollably.

The atmosphere in the private room had peaked with that single splash. Everyone erupted in cheers, their excitement oblivious to my discomfort.

“That’s the move, Wyatt! Savannah is our campus face, our calling card. You can’t let the beauty suffer. Gotta sacrifice the girlfriend for the greater good!”

“Seriously, who’d soak Savannah? If she caught a cold or got sick, we’d be stuck without our queen for days.”

“Yeah, none of the other girls on campus even come close.”

Savannah simply smirked, soaking up the attention with entitled grace.

Someone held a microphone up to Wyatt like a reporter. “Mr. Wyatt, what was the psychological impulse behind that difficult choice?”

The crowd leaned in, hungry for gossip.

Wyatt irritably pushed the glass away. “Stop making a scene. I picked Aria only because Savannah mentioned she had a cold.”

He walked over to me, pulling a clean hand towel from the server’s stand to gently wipe my face, then shrugged off his cashmere cardigan and draped it over my shoulders.

My disguise, thanks to high-quality, theater-grade makeup, was still intact: my skin the color of wheat, the carefully drawn freckles that covered my cheeks, and my slightly puffy, unimpressive eyes. With my hair plastered wetly to my skull, I was, objectively, not attractive.

Laughter rippled through the onlookers. A few girls who had always disliked me piped up.

“Wyatt, seriously, why are you even dating Aria? You two are mismatched from head to toe.”

Everyone believed I didn't deserve Wyatt. I’d heard versions of this since we started dating. In the past, Wyatt would always scowl, tell them to take it back, and then reassure me that their opinions didn’t matter to him.

But this time, he didn't refute them.

Savannah’s eyes were fixed on him, and I saw Wyatt’s peripheral glance straying right back to her.

A sickening sourness rose in my throat.

I instinctively grabbed Wyatt’s hand, but he flinched, pulling away instantly.

I stared at him in shocked disbelief.

Wyatt realized his mistake and quickly re-grasped my hand, but his gaze was shifting nervously.

Just then, someone nearby announced, “Oh no, Savannah’s had too much champagne. Wyatt, you’re the only one with a car, can you drive her home?”

“Sure.” He agreed without a moment’s hesitation.

He turned to me. “Aria, Savannah lives on the opposite side of the city from you. I’ll call you a ride-share. You can head back, okay?”

Before I could speak, others rushed to back him up.

“What’s the big deal? She looks safe enough, nothing to worry about.”

“Aria, you haven’t forgotten how to get home without your boyfriend, have you?”

I opened my mouth, but the words stuck. My chest felt tight and heavy. Wyatt would never let me leave alone at night. He always insisted it was too dangerous for a young woman, and he’d wait outside, watching, until I was safely inside, even if it was just a few feet away.

I squeezed his hand tightly. “Wyatt, I—”

I was about to suggest I could ride along to drop Savannah off, but Savannah let out a painful groan.

Wyatt instantly pulled his hand free and rushed to her side.

He swept her up into his arms.

I stood frozen in place, the party noise rushing into my ears.

“Savannah looks flushed, she might have a fever!”

“My bad, my bad, I shouldn’t have pushed her to drink with her cold.”

Wyatt’s voice was urgent. “I’m taking her to the Urgent Care!”

He dashed past me, cradling her, and his shoulder slammed hard into mine. I stumbled, falling to the ground, but he kept running, disappearing with the campus queen in his arms.

Between the dousing of ice water and the prolonged wait for a ride in the cold night air, I was predictably running a fever the next morning.

I emailed my program advisor to request an extension and then called Wyatt.

The phone rang for a long time before it was picked up.

“W-Wyatt, I think I have a fever…” My voice was hoarse and weak.

There was a silence, and then a woman’s voice—edged with a smug arrogance—came through the line.

“Wyatt’s asleep. Do you want me to wake him?”

My blood turned to ice. It took me a moment to find my voice.

“Savannah? You’re at his place…”

She chuckled. “To be precise, I am at his place. I was on an IV drip late last night, and my apartment is far. Wyatt brought me back here.”

She paused, then her tone shifted to one of complete, assured victory. “Aria, you know, I could take Wyatt from you whenever I want. But taking your man would be far too easy.”

Her words dripped with pride and confidence. You’re not even a worthy opponent, was the unspoken message.

I balled my fists, forcing myself to stay calm. My voice was a cold whisper. “Wyatt isn’t some object. And he’s different from other guys.”

Savannah laughed harder. “Defending him? Fine, I have something fun for you to hear.”

She played a recording. Savannah’s slightly slurred, drunk voice was the first sound.

“Wyatt, you never answered my question last night. Why are you really with Aria?”

Then Wyatt’s voice: “She’s smart, she’s kind, she’s a good person. Why wouldn’t I be with her?”

My tense muscles relaxed a fraction, and a faint, hopeful smile touched my lips. I knew it. Wyatt was different.

But before I could feel any lasting relief, Savannah’s voice continued on the recording:

“Is that so? Then why did you choose to take me home and not her? Why have you been sneaking glances at me all night?”

“Wyatt, what if I told you that if you break up with her, I’ll be with you?”

My heart seized up. Please, Wyatt, answer. Tell her you only love me. Reject her, now!

A shaky, hesitant sound came from him. “Would you, really?” His voice was laced with an undeniable tension and a subtle, desperate hope.

My entire world crashed down.

The recording cut off. Savannah’s voice, sharp and triumphant, returned. “Get it now? Aria, being pretty is everything.”

I hung up the phone.

Hugging my knees to my chest, I finally admitted it: I was terrified.

The fever-induced haze made thinking almost impossible, yet the image from high school flashed clearly in my mind: Wyatt climbing through that window, his warm hand enveloping mine.

The white-shirted boy, full of righteous conviction. His palm was hot, sending a surge of strength into my own cold grip.

“Aria, beauty isn’t the only way to judge a person. You are you.”

That sentence had changed everything for me. I had hated myself then. My beauty had brought trouble to my family; my disguised mediocrity had made me a target for bullies. I had questioned my very existence.

Wyatt’s words had forced me to re-examine myself, to focus on my character, my soul, rather than my surface.

But I had forgotten that people change.

Regardless of his feelings, I needed to hear the truth from him, face-to-face.

I took some medication and slept for the rest of the day. The next morning, I saw a string of missed calls on my phone.

Not one of them was from Wyatt.

Before, if I went an hour without texting him, he’d race over, frantic that something had happened to me.

I laughed a dry, self-mocking laugh. The answer was obvious.

I composed myself and called the person who had called the most: my Program Advisor.

She picked up immediately. “Aria, you finally answered. I heard you were sick, so you don’t need to worry about the Ivy League professor reception in three days. We’ve found a replacement.”

I froze, then quickly said, “Professor, I’m completely better, I can still go!”

A little over a month ago, when the university learned that an Ivy League consortium would be visiting, they selected a small group of top students for the delegation. My fluency in French and German, and my polished etiquette, had earned me a spot.

The credits from this event were crucial for my application to a prestigious graduate program overseas. For the past month, I had spent at least four hours every day preparing my presentations.

My advisor had praised my dedication just last week. How could they replace me so easily?

I rushed to the school to speak with her, insisting I was fully recovered and the assignment would not be affected.

She sighed, giving me the honest truth.

“Aria, I know how hard you worked. But Wyatt’s family just cut the school a check for a new Research Wing. Wyatt specifically requested Savannah take your place, and we simply couldn’t refuse…”

“You what?” I heard my own voice, rough and abrasive.

My advisor suddenly remembered who I was dating, and a look of regret crossed her face.

“I won’t get involved in your personal matters. If you have questions, you should ask him yourself.”

I found Wyatt in the library lounge, coaching Savannah on her conversation skills. Savannah was struggling; her English was poor, and her conversational skills were choppy.

I had heard that Savannah desperately needed the academic credits, or she might have to postpone graduation. Wyatt had gone to incredible lengths for her.

He looked up at the sound of my footsteps, pausing when our eyes met.

“Aria, what are you doing here?”

“Wyatt, did you steal my place on the reception team?”

A flash of guilt crossed his face, quickly replaced by a sense of calm righteousness.

“Aria, Savannah will be held back if she doesn’t get these credits. You’re already set for graduation, you don’t need this. It’s no loss to you to let her have the opportunity.”

“But my graduate school application might fail! Do you have any idea how much effort I put into this?”

“Then apply next year. I’ll stay with you, okay?”

Perhaps because I had never spoken to him with such raw emotion, Wyatt seemed provoked.

“Besides, the delegation team is full of handsome men and beautiful women. Wouldn't you feel out of place standing there with them? I’m doing this to protect you, Aria, so you don’t get mocked again.”

I couldn’t believe those words came from his mouth. He was the one who had held me, comforting me repeatedly, telling me to ignore the judgment of others. Now, he was the one stating his true feelings so plainly.

The insults others had thrown at my appearance never hurt me. But one sentence from Wyatt broke me completely.

The earnest, compassionate boy I had loved was truly gone.

My eyes burned, and my body shook with indignation.

Perhaps seeing me like this for the first time scared Wyatt a little. He instinctively lifted a hand to wipe away my tears.

At that moment, Savannah let out a small sob.

“I’m so sorry. This is my fault. I shouldn't have taken your place. I only asked if there was a chance after you mentioned you were sick.”

“It’s just a year’s delay, I can try again next year. Wyatt, give her the position back.”

As Savannah spoke, tears streamed down her face like precious pearls. She was, undeniably, beautiful even when crying.

Compared to my own hysterical state, Wyatt’s focus instantly shifted.

Looking at my red, swollen eyes and the dense layer of freckles on my cheeks, a flicker of disgust crossed his face.

“Aria, when did you become so selfish and cold-blooded?”

“Savannah’s family is struggling. An extra year of tuition and living expenses is a huge burden on them. Are you really only thinking of yourself?”

“I got involved with you because I thought you were kind. But look at you now. There’s nothing left to love.”

My fingers curled into tight knots. My voice was a desperate, exhausted whisper.

“Then... we’re done. Break up.”

Savannah’s shriek rang out simultaneously with my words.

Wyatt didn't even look at me. He raced to Savannah’s side, swatting at a small insect that had landed on her dress.

Savannah shrank into his embrace, flashing a quick, confident smirk in my direction.

It was the look that confirmed what she had said on the phone: she could take Wyatt whenever she wanted.

It no longer mattered whether Wyatt had heard my declaration. A man whose loyalty could be usurped by a pretty face was a man I no longer wanted.

After calming Savannah, Wyatt turned around and noticed I was gone.

He frowned, then a look of sudden panic flashed in his eyes. He thought he'd heard me say the word 'breakup.'

He shook his head. No, he must have misheard.

I had already resigned myself to losing the graduate school credit when my program advisor called me later that night.

One of the selected students had been rushed to the ER with acute gastroenteritis. I was asked to step in at the last minute.

I agreed.

Early the next morning, I dressed meticulously and waited by the campus entrance. The other student ambassadors arrived, one by one.

Savannah's eyes widened when she saw me.

I ignored her, quietly rehearsing the explanation I had painstakingly prepared.

A crowd of students who had come to watch the VIPs gathered nearby. Someone yelled out.

“Why is there a dirt smudge mixed in with the handsome ambassadors?”

“Seriously, one bad apple spoils the whole bunch!”

“Didn’t they pick the best students? That usually includes their appearance, right?”

“Where does she get the nerve to stand there?”

The loudest insults came from Savannah’s fan club, but as the discussion grew, others joined in, their eyes full of amused scorn.

I kept my gaze forward, ignoring their judgment. I turned my head and met Wyatt’s eyes.

He froze, then quickly looked away, as if afraid someone might discover our relationship.

A sudden, wicked impulse sparked within me.

I waved at him. “Wyatt! Don’t I look pretty?”

Wyatt stared at me, dumbfounded.

The surrounding students all looked at him.

“Hey, man, you know her?”

“Is that your girlfriend?”

“No!” Wyatt denied it loudly.

The small, deliberate smile I had forced onto my face faltered.

My heart felt as if a massive, icy hand had squeezed it tight. The pain was suffocating.

Suddenly, someone shoved me hard. My heel caught, and I tumbled to the ground.

Something warm and wet splashed over me.

Savannah cried out an apology, but it wasn't for me. “Oh, I’m so sorry! I didn’t mean to!” she said to the boy next to her.

I looked up. She was apologizing to a male student.

“It was so sweet of you to make me that hot oatmeal, and I dropped it!”

The boy’s face was beet red. “No, no problem! I can make you another batch!”

“Savannah, you did that on purpose!”

I scrambled to my feet and lunged forward, aiming a slap at her face.

Wyatt rushed in and grabbed my arm, yanking me back. He looked furious.

“What are you doing! She only accidentally spilled something on you, and you want to hit her?”

“She’s the campus queen! She represents our school’s image!”

“And what about me? Am I not a student here? Does her pretty face excuse everything?”

“Wyatt, you’re the one who told me that looks don't matter!”

My eyes were swimming in disappointment. I wrenched my arm free and turned to walk away.

Wyatt was left standing there, confused.

Everyone assumed I had left, too ashamed to stay, soaked in sticky oatmeal, my clothes and makeup ruined. Some said I had finally realized how out of place I was.

As the arrival of the guests grew imminent and I still hadn't returned, the advisor grew frantic. “We’re one short! Is Aria coming back?”

“Professor, she deliberately walked out, you should dock her credits!”

“This is a key day for the school, she needs a disciplinary record!”

“I say she should be expelled! She’s embarrassing the school!”

At that moment, a motorcade of dark sedans pulled up, and everyone turned excitedly to the entrance.

The advisor, panicking, was about to step in herself when a voice came from behind.

“Professor, I’m ready now.”

Hearing my voice, the advisor let out a huge sigh of relief and turned to me.

“Aria, perfect timing, quick—”

She stopped mid-sentence. Her breath caught in her throat.

“You... who are you?”

Along with the advisor’s stunned question, the crowd also turned. Every single person who saw my face froze, slack-jawed.

Savannah’s face went instantly white.

I smiled faintly. “Professor, it’s Aria.”

A hand clamped down hard on my arm. Wyatt stared at me, his eyes wide with disbelief.

“You’re Aria?!”
