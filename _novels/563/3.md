Eleanor’s hand froze. A moment later, her gaze darted away, and she withdrew her hand.

“Nonsense. If you want, we could buy a house by the sea. Then, you could every single day…”

Watch the sea?

She left those two words unsaid, and a dead silence filled the car. The assistant driving jolted their hand, swerving the steering wheel. I slammed into Eleanor’s shoulder.

Eleanor immediately pulled me into her embrace, gently stroking my hair.

“It’s okay. Get some sleep. I’ll wake you when we get there.”

Looking at the face I had loved for three years, I couldn't bear it and closed my eyes.

After a long while, Eleanor seemed to think I was asleep. She let out a cold laugh and called her assistant's name.

“I’m warning you, if you dare to spill anything to Alex, your family will share the consequences with you.”

The assistant stammered, their voice trembling.

“Don’t worry, I won’t say a word.”

Eleanor finally relaxed, sighing.

“Blame him for getting in Damian’s way. Tonight, bring those thugs from before. I’ll get him drunk tonight, and you make sure they’re ready. Have them destroy his eyes. Even if it gets investigated, it’ll have nothing to do with us.”

“If it goes to court, we’ll just say… it was those men retaliating against Alex after they got out of prison.”

The assistant hesitated.

“But Ms. Eleanor, Mr. Alex has a deep trauma from those men. He trembles just seeing strangers, let alone anyone besides you.”

“If Mr. Alex is too traumatized, the consequences could be dire!”

Eleanor reached back and gripped her assistant’s shoulder, her voice filled with cruelty.

“So what? The worst that could happen is he goes insane. We’ll just keep him in the basement. I have plenty of money to support him anyway. He can live comfortably without ever working. He should be grateful.”

“Unless you have feelings for my husband? Is that why you keep spouting such nonsense!”

The assistant, cowed by Eleanor’s aura, could only squeeze out a few words of pleading.

The car came to a smooth stop on the beach. I opened my eyes, clenching my fists as I looked at the turbulent sea.

In this life, I had endured too much. I couldn’t bear this inhuman torment for another moment.

Tonight, to be buried in the sea I loved most. Perhaps it was my best option.

But before I die, Eleanor. I will make you pay for your actions!

Eleanor thoughtfully prepared a new wheelchair for me, and she was now pushing me towards the yacht. The aroma of the early prepared dinner was inviting, but I had no mind to savor it. As she positioned my wheelchair, I slipped a sleeping pill into her drink.

As we clinked glasses, Eleanor’s face flushed pink. Her movements became increasingly sluggish.

My phone buzzed. I pulled it out of my pocket; it was a message from a reporter.

“We heard about your experience and hope to speak out for you. Although you declined our invitation last time, I’d like to try again.”

“As a rising star in the sports world back then, you were highly anticipated. But due to an assault by thugs and betrayal by your ex-girlfriend spreading rumors, your career and life plummeted.”

“Although you won the lawsuit back then, the arrested individuals were hired. The real mastermind is still at large. Do you truly not want to uncover the truth of what happened that year?”

My grip on the phone tightened. The hatred in my heart grew deeper.

Eleanor, who was now slurring her words, looked up at me.

“Alex, who are you texting? Didn’t I tell you?”

“There are too many bad people in this world. It’s my fault for protecting you too well, making you so unguarded.”

“You shouldn’t talk to outsiders. Be a good boy, give me your phone.”
