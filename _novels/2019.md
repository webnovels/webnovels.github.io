The day I got out of prison, my parents dragged me straight to a promotion party for one of their star students.
Three glasses of champagne in, the student, Noah Gallagher—now a District Attorney—leaned toward my parents, his speech slurring slightly.
“Professor, Mrs. Albright, you are my saving grace! I wouldn’t be here today if Rory hadn’t taken the fall for me!”
I assumed it was drunken hyperbole.
“Come now, Noah, you’re the DA. You make it sound like my parents, both brilliant attorneys, would actually throw their own daughter under the bus.” I offered a tight smile. “I was careless. I was the one who accidentally leaked the confidential national security data.”
He froze, missing the frantic, subtle headshakes my mother was giving him.
“You don’t know? You didn’t volunteer to take the fall? Your dad was running point, waving your signed confession around town…” He stopped, staring at me with genuine surprise. “He said you were underage and would be out in a couple of years. But if I’d had that felony on my record, my career would be dead on arrival.”
Slowly, deliberately, I turned my head to face my parents.
They lowered their wine glasses, their voices dropping to a conspiratorial hush.
“Rory, Noah is a young man. He’s like a son to us now. He needs a spotless career trajectory. He can’t have a stain.”
“You’re different. A girl’s career isn’t as critical. Besides, we were able to negotiate an excellent plea deal. We never intended for you to truly suffer.”
Never intended for me to truly suffer?
Five years of beatings, the electric shock therapy, the solitary confinement… Every spoonful of rancid slop I’d swallowed was a biting reminder of how utterly ridiculous that claim was.
I laughed, tears streaming down my face. With a sudden surge of strength, I swept my arm across the table, sending the towering champagne flute pyramid crashing down.
“So, having high-powered attorney parents means I deserve to be locked away?” The sound of glass shattering was deafening.
“Well, today, I’m an orphan.”

1
Glass shards scattered, one slicing my forearm. Blood mingled with expensive wine, dripping steadily onto the pristine white carpet. I didn’t flinch. I just stared at my parents.
How could the people who came to visit me every week, rain or shine, be the architects of my destruction?
They didn't even look at me.
My father, Victor Albright, turned to the stunned guests, plastering on his professional, reassuring smile.
“Please forgive the scene, everyone. Our daughter… she’s just been released. She’s experiencing a severe psychological break.”
My mother, Elaine, nodded in practiced synchronization, her eyes immediately welling up with tears.
“It’s been a traumatic five years for her. We haven't managed her PTSD well. It’s entirely our fault.”
The guests instantly switched from shock to sympathy.
A few older family friends came over, patting my shoulder.
“Rory, sweetie, don’t make a scene. Your parents love you. They only have one daughter; they would never harm you.”
“Exactly. Your mother and father made an immense, selfless contribution to the field. They channeled their devotion to you into academic excellence—publishing her case study in the Journal of Criminology. You should be proud of them.”
The blood drained from my head.
The weekly, mandatory visits. The careful, probing questions about my emotional state, my interactions, the disciplinary measures. They weren't acts of care. They were data collection.
I wasn't just a scapegoat. I was their lab rat.
The final, frayed wire in my brain snapped.
I stumbled back, catching the edge of a small side table and flipping it completely.
“How could you?! How could you do this to me?!”
The scream ripped through my throat. I was blind with fury, oblivious to my father’s hand as it swung high in the air.
Snap!
The sharp crack of his palm against my cheek echoed the falling table. A stinging cut immediately bloomed where his wedding ring had scraped my skin.
I slowly turned, looking at him.
He was staring at me, his lips moving, the words more damning than any sentence.
“Have you made enough of a spectacle? Stop embarrassing us! You’re having a breakdown. Get home and take your medication!”
Drained of all strength, I was yanked out of the ballroom, through the service entrance, and shoved into the back of their waiting car.
The moment we were inside the house, my mother slammed me to my knees on the hardwood floor.
“Rory Albright!”
Her eyes were blazing, devoid of the slightest maternal warmth, only cold, calculated rage.
“Do you have any idea what you just ruined? That was Noah’s crucial promotion dinner!”
“He’s on the fast track to the DA’s office. You humiliated him in front of the entire Judiciary Committee! How is he supposed to manage his career now?!”
My father stood behind her, his voice a chilling monotone.
“We poured money and connections into him for five years. We plucked him out of the rural Midwest, put him through school, and worked the entire system for this moment. Your tantrum could have completely destroyed our investment.”
“And what about me? I was sixteen, I got into Georgetown Law, and you personally destroyed my future for him…”
My father cut my protest off, his tone detached, like a closing argument in court.
“Rory, be rational. Noah is a man. He must have a future; a single stain would prevent him from ever recovering.”
“You? You’re a juvenile female. The system is more forgiving. The national security leak charge was manageable, and your mother and I mitigated the sentence. It was the only rational, optimal solution.”
“Optimal solution?”
I laughed, blood and tears mixing on my face.
“Were the beatings, the shock therapy, the solitary confinement… were those also part of your calculated, necessary costs?”
My mother’s eyes narrowed dangerously.
“You have the nerve to bring that up? Clearly, the lessons in that facility weren't harsh enough! You didn’t learn a thing!”
“You’re twenty-one, and you’re still throwing public tantrums? You embarrassed us in front of our entire professional network!”
My father took over, his voice utterly cold.
“That’s right. You’ve always been stubborn and disobedient. Going in was good for you. A little suffering, a little character adjustment. You needed to see how harsh the world is, so you’d finally learn to obey.”
My mother nodded, a sickeningly self-righteous tone creeping into her voice.
“A criminal record isn't a bad thing. It ensures you’ll always rely on us. A girl should be obedient.”
I felt as if I’d been plunged into an ice bath. Every punch I took, every hour of solitary confinement, had been a planned component of their warped "tough love" educational program. Even the permanent felony—the lifelong stain—was a deliberate insurance policy to keep me tethered to them.
“Are you even human?!” I shrieked.
“I’m cutting all ties with you! I want nothing to do with you!”
My father’s face hardened. He grabbed my arm, his grip vise-like, threatening to crush the bone. My mother quickly opened a bedroom door, and together they shoved me inside.
“You stay in there and think about what you’ve done,” my father’s voice came from the hall, devoid of warmth. “Think about it carefully. Without us, where can a felon go? What can you possibly do?”
My mother’s voice followed, softer but even more chilling.
“Rory, you’ll realize soon enough. You can’t survive without us.”
The lock clicked shut.
I collapsed onto the floor, staring at my childhood room. The pale pink walls were long gone, replaced by a cold institutional gray. In the closet, a rack of expensive, tailored men’s shirts hung, clearly not mine. The air was thick with Noah’s high-end cologne.
The space in their hearts belonged to him. Now, even my physical space was gone.
Sometime after midnight, in the suffocating silence, I fumbled in a desk drawer and found an old, bent bobby pin. My hands were shaking violently, but I gritted my teeth and began slowly picking the lock.
I slipped out of that house and into the night.
2
I spent the night curled up in a 24-hour ATM vestibule, hidden from the cold.
My parents didn’t come looking for me. As long as I wasn't actively blocking Noah’s path, they likely couldn’t be bothered. Good.
The second the sun rose, I started looking for work.
Felony conviction. High school diploma (the college acceptance meant nothing now). Those two labels were plastered across my forehead. Everyone who interviewed me looked at me as if they already knew the whole story. No one would hire me.
My cash was running low.
I planned to buy a train ticket to a small town in the Midwest, a place where no one knew the Albright name, a place my parents’ influence couldn’t reach.
But at the payment screen, a red alert flashed:
“Warning: Legal Hold Applied. Cannot purchase ticket.”
I tried buying a Greyhound bus ticket. The same message.
I froze for a second, then gave a bitter laugh. My parents knew exactly how to use the legal system—the laws they’d sworn to uphold—to legally cripple and confine me.
Completely broke, I flipped through my phone contacts, stopping on the name “Uncle David.” He was the only person besides my parents who had visited me in prison.
The phone rang for a long time before a nervous voice answered.
“Hello?”
“Uncle David, it’s Rory.”
“Rory?! Where are you?!”
His voice was instantly raised.
“Your parents said you had a psychological break! They’ve been circulating an official statement on your mental fitness to the Bar Association, asking everyone not to engage with you!”
My grip on the phone tightened.
“The statement is a lie. They forced it. Uncle David, I need a little cash…”
“Rory, listen to your uncle. Just come home.”
He lowered his voice, but the fear and helplessness were palpable. “Your father called me personally. He said anyone who helps you is making an enemy of him, and he has the means to destroy anyone who crosses him…”
“Rory, it’s not that I don’t care, but I have a family to support…”
My heart was sinking with every word.
“Noah is a good boy; he treats your parents like his own. Your parents are just ambitious for him, that’s all. They love you, Rory. Everything they did was for the good of the family…”
“Uncle David.” I cut him off, my voice dangerously calm. “Do you know about the abuse I suffered in prison? The beatings, the electric shocks, the solitary confinement? Those were all explicitly requested by my parents to ‘teach me submission.’”
“Do you know my dream? I killed myself studying to get into Georgetown Law so I could become a prosecutor. They personally destroyed it, just to pave a clean path for Noah.”
“I’d rather die than have parents like that. Please take care of yourself.”
Penniless, I ended up sleeping on a park bench next to a dumpster. The stench mixed with the cold wind. A single, stale bagel lasted me three days.
But it was, at least, freedom.
A few days later, I finally found a job: working the janitorial night shift at a massive downtown shopping center.
The balding, middle-aged manager looked me up and down. “It’s tough work, kid. You won’t last. Just give me two weeks' notice if you quit, so you don't screw up my schedule.”
The work was brutal. The mall was always crowded; the restrooms were a constant disaster. Mopping floors, scrubbing toilets, unclogging sinks, changing overflowing trash cans—my hands never stopped moving. The caustic chemicals burned my eyes. Within days, my hands were raw, wrinkled, and covered in thin, painful blisters. Sometimes a drunk customer would vomit all over the floor.
But the physical pain was nothing compared to the sting of my mother's words.
My phone rang—an unknown number. I thought it might be a job interviewer, hastily wiped my hands on my scrubs, and answered.
“Have you finished playing games? It’s time to come home.”
My mother’s voice was like ice.
“You won’t find a job, Rory. We've made sure of that. No one will hire a documented felon with a psychological record.”
I didn't speak, my fingernails digging into my palm.
She must have heard my ragged breathing. Her tone softened slightly, making her words even more suffocating.
“Rory, stop being stubborn. I’ve arranged a position for you—a receptionist at your father’s law firm.”
“It’s a light schedule, nine to five. Everyone there knows you served time and have emotional issues. No one will pressure you.”
I didn't reply. I hung up the phone and jammed the scrub brush deep into the toilet bowl, scouring the stains with every ounce of frustration I had. Water splashed my face. It tasted salty.
I thought that was the end of it.
Three days later, she showed up.

I was kneeling on the cold tile, wiping up a mess a customer had thrown up, when I heard my mother and Noah laughing nearby.
“That custom suit fits you perfectly, Noah. I have no doubt you’ll be the youngest presiding DA in the city’s history.”
The conversation stopped abruptly. She had spotted me.
Our eyes met. The triumphant smile instantly froze on her face.
She strode over quickly, her eyes raking over my ill-fitting uniform and the filthy mop in my hand.
“You… you’re working here… doing this?”
Her voice was a low, disgusted whisper, a verbal whiplash.
I said nothing, bending back down to scrub the floor.
“Rory Albright!”
She grabbed my wrist. The force of her grip popped one of the thin blisters on my palm. Yellow pus smeared onto her manicured hand, but she didn’t seem to notice.
“Look at the state of you! Who are you trying to ruin? Yourself?!”
“What will people say about me? About your father? Where will we put our faces?”
I yanked my hand back, looking straight into her eyes.
“Were you concerned about ‘what people would say’ when you locked me in a federal facility?”
She choked on her words, her face cycling from white to deep crimson. She took a deep breath, trying to regain her composure.
“Rory, stop the theatrics. Let’s talk rationally. You working in a place like this… It breaks my heart.”
“Breaks your heart?”
I gave a humorless laugh.
“Do you care about me, or are you just embarrassed that your daughter, the brilliant Professor Albright’s daughter, is scrubbing a public toilet?”
Her face flushed completely, her chest heaving.
“Rory! How long are you going to keep this up?! You refuse to work at the family company, you insist on cleaning filth in this mall—you’re doing this just to spite us, aren't you?!”
I stopped working, turning to face her fully.
“Mom, the truth is, you knew Noah’s paper contained the stolen data. You could have pulled the paper, published an erratum, and used your influence to clear him quietly.”
I took a step closer, staring her down.
“But you didn't. You waited until the FBI was involved, and you sacrificed me—the kind-hearted idiot who collected the data for him—as a quick, clean solution. You saved time, and you saved Noah’s pristine resume.”
“Only I got thrown into prison, and everything I worked for was destroyed. You can’t tell me this level of misogyny and favoritism is normal, even for you.”
My mother’s lips trembled. She glanced away, unable to meet my gaze.
“Investigating your own parents? Rory, we gave you life, we raised you. Is this how you repay us? This petty, destructive revenge?”
A deep, angry voice cut in.
My father, Victor Albright, marched over from the other side of the mall, his face thunderous. Behind him, the balding manager trailed nervously.
“Mr. Albright, Mrs. Albright, this…” the manager began, wringing his hands, trying to de-escalate.
Victor ignored him, turning on the manager with chilling authority.
“Mr. Rogers, my daughter is mentally unstable. She cannot be employed here. It poses a risk to your customers and the mall’s reputation.”
“But… Mr. Albright, that's not exactly procedure…”
“Procedure?” Victor sneered. “Would you prefer I discuss labor laws with you, or perhaps the few dozen fire code and safety violations I noticed on my way in?”
The threat was blatant.
The manager’s face crumpled. He glanced at me, sighed, and looked away.
“…Rory, gather your things. You need to leave.”
I knew then. I wouldn't be getting my final paycheck.
“You are a disgrace! Come on!” Victor didn’t look at me again, turning his attention to Noah.
Noah stood impeccably dressed in his bespoke suit, bathed in the mall’s bright, clean light. I stood in rubber boots and industrial scrubs, smelling of antiseptic and trash.
The contrast was blinding. Blood rushed to my head.
“Fine! You want to play dirty? I’ll go online! I’ll expose the truth about five years ago and everything you did after! Let’s see who looks like the disgrace then!”
Victor’s eyes narrowed. A flicker of genuine fear crossed the fury in his face.
He paused for a few seconds, then softened his voice, the shift unnerving.
“We didn't come here to threaten you.”
“Your little stunt at the party did cause issues for Noah. A few key people have begun to question his background.”
Noah stepped forward, wearing a carefully calibrated expression of regret and plea.
“Rory, all the blame is mine. Look, how about this? Record a short video. Just say that the crime five years ago was entirely your fault, that your parents had no involvement, and that you regret your actions. I’ll compensate you. I’ll give you half a million dollars.”
Victor glanced at the scrub brush still in my hand, his tone patronizing, as if granting a privilege.
“If you record this, we promise never to contact you again, and you can continue with… whatever this work is.”
A crushing sense of powerlessness washed over me. I knew, with sickening clarity, that I could not win against them.
“…I’ll record it. But I don’t want the money. Just leave me alone.”
Noah and my father exchanged a look. Noah bit his lip.
“No! You have to take the money, Rory. I couldn’t live with myself otherwise.”
I was stunned. The desperate need to escape overwhelmed my growing sense of dread.
I recited the statement my father had conveniently already drafted, gritting my teeth as the camera recorded my confession.
After they left, I clutched the prepaid debit card with the half-million on it. I felt no relief.
I quickly packed the few things I had and rushed to the bus station.
But at the gate, two police officers stopped me.
“Rory Albright, you are being detained on suspicion of felony extortion. Please come with us.”

It was only after I was formally charged and placed on a travel restriction that I realized Noah had filed the extortion complaint.
My parents were his defense attorneys.
They were preparing to personally send me back to prison.
Before the trial even began, public opinion had turned into a firing squad.
My father used his firm’s official account to publish a lengthy article:
“A Father’s Agonizing Choice: When Your Daughter Becomes an Extortionist.”
The text was melodramatic, painting me as a vicious, manipulative daughter who had repeatedly victimized her grieving parents. The final line, “As legal professionals, we cannot tolerate crime—even from our own blood,” garnered tens of thousands of likes.
My mother, Elaine, posted a case study on prominent law school forums:
“From Juvenile Prodigy to Blackmail Felon: A Psychological Case Study.”
In it, Noah was a paragon of strength overcoming adversity, while I was the pathological negative example. She framed my search for the truth as a criminal’s sick attempt to project blame onto a loving family.
Trolls and bots swarmed the internet. My jail mugshot, a grainy photo of me scrubbing the floor, and even my cheerful sixteenth birthday photo were unearthed, analyzed, and accompanied by the vilest commentary. My phone was flooded with harassing, hateful calls.
Every single comment was a deliberate cut to my already shredded nerves.
And the handle of the knife was held by my mother and father.
Before the hearing, I made one request: the proceedings would be live-streamed.
Since they wanted my social death to be a public spectacle, I would make sure the spectacle was complete.
On the day of the trial, silence fell the moment I walked into the courtroom. Hundreds of eyes, filled with disgust and condemnation, were fixed on me.
Almost simultaneously, Noah entered, flanked by Victor and Elaine.
Victor naturally reached out, smoothing a non-existent wrinkle on Noah's suit jacket, then gave his arm a tiny, approving squeeze—a gesture he only used when he was deeply satisfied.
Elaine produced a thermos, unscrewed the top, and handed it naturally to Noah.
“Take a sip, Noah. Don’t strain your voice.”
My lips were dry and cracked from stress and dehydration. No one offered me a sip of water.
The trial began.
Victor stood first, presenting the evidence with practiced calm.
The first piece was the confession I had been coerced into signing at sixteen. He tapped my youthful signature with a pointed finger, his expression full of painful disappointment.
“Sixteen years old. The handwriting of a child, but the actions of a calculated criminal…”
He paused for effect, allowing the unspoken accusation to hang heavy in the air.
Next, he presented the desperate letters I had written to them during my time in prison. He pulled one out, reading the most desperate line aloud:
“‘Dad, Mom, I’m dying in here, please save me…’”
Then, he dropped the letter, delivering his devastating conclusion.
“This was not a cry for help, Your Honor. This was a performance. A deliberate, five-year-long act of laying groundwork for an eventual appeal and slander campaign. Note the depth of the defendant’s malicious forethought.”
Finally, he displayed the forced video clarification. Victor pointed to my numb, vacant face on the screen.
“Look at her eyes. No remorse, only the fanatical resentment of a guilty party. This was not an apology. This was a challenge to justice.”
With every piece of evidence, the gallery whispered and hissed its disgust. The live-stream comments exploded: [Born Bad!] [Psycho!].
I sat there, feeling as though I was being drawn and quartered by their words.
Elaine rose next. Her posture was elegant, her words lethal.
“Your Honor, based on my twenty-one years of intimate, close-proximity observation of the defendant, coupled with her behavioral patterns inside and outside the facility, I can confirm that Rory Albright suffers from classic Paranoid Personality Disorder, accompanied by severe Victim Complex and Antisocial Tendencies.”
She even offered an anecdote.
“When she was seven, she tore up a neighbor’s child’s award ribbon out of sheer spiteful jealousy. We dismissed it as childish mischief. In retrospect, that was the pathological genesis of her current destructive and possessive nature.”
She then pivoted to Noah, her tone shifting to proud relief.
“In contrast, the plaintiff, Noah Gallagher, has steadfastly served the public interest despite the malicious framing. His psychological resilience and social adaptation stand in stark contrast to the defendant’s deterioration.”
Finally, she faced the judge, her voice sincere and firm.
“As both a mother and a professional scholar, I implore the court to impose the harshest penalty possible, accompanied by long-term mandatory psychological intervention and isolation. This is our duty to her, and to society.”
With that, she turned away, dabbing a corner of her eye with a tissue, the picture of heartbroken restraint.
“Life sentence!” someone in the gallery yelled, instantly met with murmurs of agreement.
The chat was pure [SUPPORT!]
Noah seized his moment, looking at me with a complicated expression.
“Rory, our professors have your best interests at heart. Sometimes, a temporary personal sacrifice serves a far greater blueprint. You should try to understand that scale.”
A sudden, sharp spasm hit my stomach. It was the physical manifestation of days of fear and pressure. Sweat beaded on my forehead, and my vision swam.
Finally, Victor stood, his conclusion definitive.
“The defendant shows zero remorse, and her danger to society is extreme. As her legal guardians and attorneys, we request that the court sentence her to a minimum of ten years in a federal penitentiary, to uphold the law!”
Elaine faced the judge, her voice softening slightly.
“The plaintiff, Mr. Gallagher, is a man of high moral character. Though deeply traumatized, he has voluntarily waived all civil compensation claims, highlighting the vast moral chasm between him and the defendant’s actions.”
The pain in my stomach intensified. I had to bite down hard on the inside of my cheek to remain seated.
The entire courtroom was waiting for the judge’s gavel to fall and sweep me, the toxic waste, out of their lives forever.
I gripped the edge of the table, slowly standing up.
“Your Honor, I deny all charges.”
“I request permission to call my witness.”
A flicker of confusion, then outright contempt, crossed the faces of my parents and Noah. They likely assumed I’d managed to find some irrelevant, broken soul from the park to vouch for me.
They stopped sneering the moment the side door opened.
Their faces instantly went white.
