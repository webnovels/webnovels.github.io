When Laura saw Scott coming, she said happily, "Dad, you haven't come to see me for a long time. I miss you so much."
He smiled awkwardly and said, "Sorry, I've been really busy recently. Laura, when you open your eyes after the operation, we'll be here with you."
Before the operation, Laura looked at me nervously and asked expectantly, "Mom, can I have a doll as a reward?"
I almost burst into tears.
The birthday gift Scott bought for Kelly was a truckload of expensive imported dolls, while Laura's dolls were all handmade by me.
I quickly nodded and agreed, "Laura, I'll go and buy it for you right now!"
I immediately ran out. Worrying about Laura, I just wanted to come back quickly.
But the doll that Laura wanted had already been out of production. I ran to several stores and finally managed to contact a toy merchant to buy it.
Holding the doll excitedly, I rushed back to the hospital. But suddenly, the phone in my pocket rang loudly.
It was a call from the nurse. Her voice was trembling as she said, "Ms. Turner! Something terrible has happened. That heart has been snatched away! Laura is still on the operating table. Come back quickly!"
My face turned pale, and I almost couldn't stand up.
A kind passerby saw my pale face and sent me back to the hospital. By then, I was soaked in cold sweat all over.
I stumbled to the door of the operating room. The nurse waiting there sighed, "Your husband has already gone to the transplant bank and taken the heart away."
These words shattered all my hopes.
I took out my phone with trembling hands, wanting to call Scott, but my fingers were shaking so badly that I couldn't even press the dial button.
The nurse reached out pityingly and took the phone that I could hardly hold.
The call actually got through quickly. He said, "Honey, I have something urgent..."
I didn't want to listen to his lies anymore. I roared at him in a hoarse voice, "Where is Laura's heart?"
He paused for a moment and quickly explained, "Angela, the niece of my investor has also matched the heart. Laura can wait a little longer. This time, we'll just let..."
I was so angry that my voice was shaking as I interrupted him, "Laura is on the operating table waiting for the heart to save her life! Hurry up and bring the heart back! The operation is already halfway through! How could you do this?"
Scott sighed impatiently, "You're usually so generous. What's wrong with you today? Laura will still have a chance in the future. I took the heart all for you! As long as Sarah is happy and she makes an investment, there will be money for Laura's treatment, and you can live a good life too! I'm doing this for your own good!"
Before I could reply, he hung up the phone.
I called him like crazy one after another. He just turned off his phone.
Thinking of Laura, who was still waiting for the heart in the operating room, my heart ached so much that I couldn't breathe, and I knelt on the ground.
I stared blankly at the still-lit red light of the operating room and thought, "Scott made Laura lose the chance to live. His love is like this."
The nurse beside me sighed, "You can go and ask in other hospitals. My friend said that their hospital also has a heart transplant operation today, and they just got a heart donor. Laura's operation has already started and can't be delayed any longer."
My shoes had already worn out. My soles hurt and were bleeding.
But I couldn't feel the pain and ran like crazy towards the hospital that the nurse mentioned.
