When I picked up our son from school, he said Grandpa had called saying he missed him and asked if he could stay at their place for a week.

He wanted me to take him over.

I was taken aback but helped our son pack a small suitcase. He was so excited, saying Grandpa had promised to take him to fly a drone.

After dropping our son off, my mom walked me out: "Olivia, cheer up. Go out and have some fun."

As I got in the car, my mom stood there watching me for a long time before going back inside.

I opened the mirror in the car and saw my pale face and dejected expression.

I took out my makeup and applied a bright lipstick.

I went home and packed some things.

Then I traveled for a week, hurriedly seeing many people and places, hearing many stories along the way.

I came back feeling much more spirited.

I looked at the calendar. Divorce countdown: 21 days.
