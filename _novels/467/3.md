I debated whether to tell my parents about the divorce now.

I grew up in this city, with all my relatives and friends here.

My parents are retired teachers, and I'm their only daughter.

They're very open-minded, but my father's health hasn't been great these past couple of years.

I was thinking of waiting a bit longer.

Jack called after a couple of days.

He rarely called me. Usually, he would text on SnapChat, since I would always reply promptly, which he found convenient.

Last night, I had already deleted him from my contacts.

I answered the call. Jack's voice sounded normal.

"Olivia, your mom just called me. She said she's cooked a lot of dishes tonight and wants us to come over for dinner. I think since your dad's health isn't good, maybe we should wait to tell them about the divorce until he's better. What time do you want to go over? Also, next Sunday is your dad's birthday. Should I still go with you?"

I had been hesitating, but hearing Jack's words made me decide to tell my parents the news.

I replied that it wasn't necessary.

Jack: "You don't need to be stubborn. The elderly's health is important."

I said calmly: "If you really cared, you wouldn't have an affair and ask for divorce at a time like this. My dad's health may not be great, but his mind is clear. I don't think he would want me to continue in an unfaithful marriage."

"Jack."

"Hmm?"

"Don't call again. If you want to see our son, follow the agreement. Once a week."

Hearing this, Jack dropped his conciliatory tone.

"Olivia, I'll say it again. Jason is my son too, my family..."

"But you gave up the family he belonged to, didn't you?"

Finally, I heard Jack slam down the phone. I promptly hung up and collected my somewhat shattered emotions.

I decided to drive to the mall. The bedding, sofa, and all the furniture Jack liked at home - I planned to replace it all.

And I wanted everything in stock.

After replacing everything, I cleaned the house thoroughly, then went to my mom's place.

When she saw me without Jack, she assumed he was busy.

I fell silent, feeling a bit nervous as I called out, "Mom."

She immediately sensed something was wrong. Putting down what she was doing, she just stared at me, then gently pulled me into her arms.

I didn't say anything, but as a mother, she could feel my emotions and hurt.

I tried to calmly explain everything to her. My mom handed me a tissue to wipe my tears.

Her voice was very soft.

"It's okay, divorce is quite common these days. If he's not faithful, it's better to end it sooner rather than later. Olivia, Mom only has one request for you."

She finished speaking, her eyes growing moist as she held my hand.

"Since you've decided to divorce, no matter what happens, don't ever get back together with him."

I nodded tearfully: "Okay."

After dinner, my mom and dad talked in their room for a long time. When they came out, my dad handed me a big red envelope.

He said today was a new beginning, worth celebrating.

"I hope my precious daughter will always be happy and blessed."

Leaving my parents' house, I cried for a long time in the car.

Before coming, I was so afraid of disappointing them.

They've barely argued in their lives, always getting along harmoniously.

When I married Jack, everyone disapproved, but they said they respected my decision.

Now that Jack is successful, everyone admires them for having good judgment. Yet they calmly support my divorce.

I wiped my tears and looked at the calendar.

Divorce countdown: 28 days.
