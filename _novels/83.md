At Gabriel's bachelor party, his childhood friend Rose approached him for a kiss. "Gabe, you're not engaged until tomorrow. Since you're still single tonight, can I have a little kiss?"

He hesitated for a moment, then leaned in and kissed her without hesitation.

Their friends froze, all eyes turning to me - his fiancée.

Everyone expected me to cause a scene and call off the engagement right then and there.

Instead, I walked up to them and cheered them on.

"Bravo! I love it! Why stop at a peck? Use some tongue, why don't you?"
