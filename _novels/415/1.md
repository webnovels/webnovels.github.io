"Ms. Shaw, that was brilliant! With this evidence, we can even overturn a death sentence! You're truly a shining star in our field!" As my assistant finished speaking, I gasped. This wasn't the altar or the noose, but my familiar office?! I had been reborn. Back to the morning of the case, at 10 AM when the case evidence was about to be submitted. On the desk, my assistant had already plugged the USB drive into the computer. Seeing my horrified expression, he hurriedly comforted me, "I'll upload it first, Ms. Shaw. You should rest. You must be exhausted these past few days!" I grabbed his wrist. "Wait." "Bring the materials back, I'll revise another version." My assistant looked confused but still followed my instructions and didn't upload the materials. I counted the clock on the wall... Ten minutes later, my phone rang as expected. It was a call from the judge. "What?! Our evidence hasn't been submitted yet, but it's already been fully refuted by prosecutor Rachel Wilson?" My assistant shoved the phone in front of me, his voice shaking: "Jennifer, look, the materials in our hands haven't been sent out yet. How did Rachel Wilson know about them and how could she refute them point by point? Is it... is it possible that we have a mole in our team who leaked information?!" I closed my eyes, my breathing tense: It was the same time, the same evidence, the same case as in my previous life. For some reason, Rachel Wilson was able to know all the evidence I had in advance, Refuting everything and outmaneuvering me at every turn. She even managed to achieve a spectacular reversal victory in her career when we had the trump card. I remember that day in court, the applause for her was endless. I frantically tried to make the evidence sources public to everyone, but still couldn't prove my innocence. Instead, I was expelled from the law firm for leaking confidential information and completely lost my lawyer qualification. I thought my fiancé Ethan Cole would believe me and confided in him. But he made our conversation public. He came out to apologize for me publicly, expressing his disgust and cutting ties with me. He finally succeeded in eliminating me, his biggest competitor, allowing Rachel Wilson to stand on the pinnacle of the lifetime achievement award. On stage, Rachel Wilson was radiant, smiling and saying, "Justice will never be tainted." Off stage, I was in despair, hanging myself at the lawyer position I loved most. I never expected that the person I trusted most would stab me in the back so deeply. This life, I looked at the camera on the wall and smirked, "Check the surveillance footage for me." I want to see which ghost leaked the key evidence I had carefully prepared in advance.
