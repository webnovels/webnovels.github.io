I found myself in a novel as the malicious supporting character.

But I haven't done anything wrong. I've even become friends with the heroine and married the gentle second lead.

I always thought I was happy until I stumbled upon my husband's diary.

It turns out he was reborn. All these years of kindness were just to prevent me from harming the heroine...
