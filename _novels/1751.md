The first boom of the New Year’s Eve fireworks rattled the windowpane.
I had been fading for years, ever since I gave Graham a piece of myself—my kidney. Now, having used my last reserves of energy to bake his favorite holiday apple crumble, my heart seized, a violent, final spasm. I collapsed onto the living room sofa for a moment’s rest, but the rest never ended.
The wall clock read 8:00 PM.
Graham Pierce, our son Finn, and Vanessa Ray walked in, a tableau of the life he was already living.
Seeing me "asleep" on the sofa, Graham didn't yell. He just sighed the heavy sigh of a man perpetually disappointed. He tossed a small, designer clutch—my Christmas gift—onto the glass coffee table.
“What, you’re napping again? Liz, if you’re too sick, you shouldn’t push yourself to bake all day.”
Vanessa, predictably, was already tearing up, her eyes wide with manufactured distress. “Don’t blame Liz, Graham,” she whispered. “She texted me earlier, told me she didn’t want to see me, told me to leave... I really should go.”
Graham looked at my motionless form, and the flicker of pity in his eyes was instantly eclipsed by pure, weary frustration.
“Eliza Sutton, when are you going to stop this? Vanessa is here for work, nothing more. Can’t you show a little grace?”
I lay there, a cooling corpse, as he spent his New Year’s Eve railing against my imagined jealousy, his voice heavy with the injustice of having to choose between his sick wife and his dedicated assistant.
The lie—that I was merely sleeping—held fast, a thin, cruel veneer over my death, until December 26th.
…
My body was curled up, my hand still clutching a crisp fifty-dollar bill wrapped in a small, slightly wrinkled card—Finn’s holiday money. I watched as Graham, Vanessa, and Finn stood at the entryway like a real, perfect little family.
Graham was the first to smell the smoke. His brows furrowed in annoyance. He marched toward the kitchen and turned off the stove. The pot I’d left on to heat the crumble’s topping had boiled dry; the bottom of the pan was red-hot and warped.
“Getting worse and worse,” he muttered.
But when he turned and his eyes landed on me, something shifted. That annoyance was laced with a complicated, fleeting kind of tenderness. He walked over, his steps light. He was going to shake me awake, but he saw the dark, deep circles under my eyes and stopped, his hand halting inches from my face.
In the end, he simply draped the heavy wool throw from the sofa arm over my body.
“Just let her sleep,” he sighed. “She just keeps getting worse.”
That was the sentence that made my already cold heart ache.
Finn dropped his backpack and ran to the sofa, giving my shoulder a small shake. “Mom, I’m home.”
I couldn’t answer him.
Vanessa, seizing the opportunity while Graham stepped onto the balcony to take a phone call, swiftly pulled Finn away.
“Sweetie, Mom is so tired. Let her rest. Why don’t you go put your things away?”
She ushered Finn into his room. It was just her and me in the living room.
I saw a flash of something chillingly cruel in her eyes. She snatched my phone, which had fallen into the sofa cushion. She knew my password—Graham’s birthday—and she typed quickly. She edited a vicious text to her own number and set the timer for it to send later that night.
It wasn’t enough.
She walked to the bar cart, grabbed a crystal tumbler, and her eyes, filled with pure, venomous hatred, locked onto my unmoving face. She deliberately smashed the glass on the hardwood floor.
“Ah!”
She let out a piercing scream, instantly dropped to her knees, and plunged her hand into the jagged shards.
Graham burst in from the balcony. “What happened?”
Vanessa lifted her head, and the tears came instantly, fat and thick. She held up her blood-soaked hand, her voice thick with fake hysteria.
“Graham... I-I just wanted to get Liz some water. And she... she seemed so angry. She threw the cup and now she won’t even look at me.” She choked back a sob. “I shouldn’t have come. I’ll leave.”
Graham’s face was dark. He looked at the mess on the floor, then at my body, curled beneath the blanket, motionless. The last sliver of compassion in his eyes was replaced by profound exasperation.
“Eliza Sutton!”
“A guest is here, and you’re acting like a child! Throwing things? Stop being so dramatic!”
I couldn’t answer.
Finn, terrified, ran out of his room. He looked from me to Vanessa and burst into tears. “I don’t want apple crumble! I want pizza!”
Graham instinctively snapped, “Ask your mother to—"
He stopped short. He looked at my seemingly fragile form and waved a dismissive hand. “Forget it! I can’t rely on her. Come on. Dad’s taking you both out.”
Before leaving, he pulled out a sleek credit card and the designer clutch, pushing them onto the coffee table. He added the small, imported pill bottle I knew he’d paid a fortune for.
“I pulled strings to get this. Take it when you cool down.” He paused, and his voice turned ice cold. “Stop looking like death is around the corner just to punish me, Liz. I’m exhausted.”
Then he turned to go.
He reached the doorway, hesitated, and turned back, a strange impulse making him reach out to feel my forehead, check for a fever. Just as his fingers were about to brush my skin, Vanessa cried out in pain.
“Graham, my hand... it hurts so much. I think the bleeding won’t stop.”
Graham’s hand retracted. He rushed to Vanessa’s side, grasping her injured hand, his concern immediate and genuine.
“Let’s go. We need to get you stitched up. I don't want you to scar.”
The front door slammed shut.
The world went silent.
The bottle of medicine he’d gone to such lengths to acquire lay on the table, less than a yard from my cooling corpse.
I floated above them at the high-end Italian restaurant. Graham was patiently cracking King Crab legs for Finn. Vanessa, smiling, held up her phone and took a photo of the warm father-son moment.
She skillfully opened her social media app and typed out the caption.
“My world. So much to be grateful for this New Year's.”
The photo was of Graham's gentle profile and Finn’s happy, innocent smile.
Back home, the temperature in the living room was dropping steadily. My body, like the deepening night outside, was growing utterly cold.
Halfway through the meal, Vanessa’s phone chimed.
She glanced at the screen, and her face went instantly white. Her fork clattered to the floor.
She covered her mouth in an exaggerated gesture of terror, tears spilling out. She was shaking as she shoved the phone toward Graham.
“Graham... Liz... she sent me a text...”
“She says if I dare to come back to the house tonight, she’ll stab me with a knife...”
Graham’s face went black with rage. He snatched the phone.
The screen showed a text from my familiar contact photo, sent ten minutes prior. It was the one Vanessa had timed.
“Vanessa Ray, don’t think your little dinner date means you win. I just sharpened the carving knife. You step foot in my house, and I promise you, it will be a bloodbath. We’ll die together!”
Graham slammed his fist onto the table, the noise loud enough to make neighboring patrons turn their heads. He pulled out his phone and furiously dialed my number.
After three consecutive calls went unanswered, Graham let out a cold, low laugh.
“Good one, Eliza Sutton. You’ve grown teeth. Threatening people and now playing the disappearing act? Giving me the silent treatment?”
Vanessa melted into his arms.
“Graham, I’m so scared... Her mental state is terrifying. What if she really is waiting with a knife? Finn is there... we can’t risk him.”
Graham looked down at the terrified woman in his arms, then at his wide-eyed, innocent son, still chewing on a crab leg. His deep disgust for me finally crushed his last shred of reason.
He made the decision that would haunt him for the rest of his life.
“We are not going home tonight.”
“If she wants to have a breakdown, she can have it alone.”
He stood up, grabbing his coat.
“We’re driving straight up to Park City. We’ll spend a few days at the resort. When she’s calmed down, we’ll come back and talk about the divorce.”
He signaled the waiter for the check. His black luxury car merged into the city traffic, carrying them further and further away from our home.
The living room was pitch black.
My phone, which had been ringing relentlessly, was lying less than a yard from my body. The screen flashed in the darkness, illuminating the dark-purple livor mortis already starting to spread across my face.
It showed Graham’s three missed calls.
And his final, brutal voicemail notification.
“Liz, you’ve choked the life out of me for years. Vanessa is just my assistant. If you can’t handle that, you can spend the holidays alone. Don’t expect us back!”
Over the next few days, I didn't "bother" them.
He took my silence as proof that his cold treatment had worked.
He didn't know.
While he was laughing on the ski slopes of Park City, I was alone, in the freezing living room, beginning to slowly decompose.
Graham was a restless mess in the Park City hotel suite, despite the roaring fire and the view of the pristine white snow. His right eye wouldn’t stop twitching, filling him with a vague, deep irritation. He picked up his phone, an impulse urging him to call and check on the house, on me. But seeing the red icons of his three unanswered calls and the cruel message he’d left, he tossed the phone aside in an act of petty defiance.
Vanessa was a master manipulator. To ensure more intimate time, she faked an injury on an easy slope the next day, twisting her ankle.
“Graham, my ankle... I can’t put any weight on it.”
Graham had no choice but to carry her on his back down the mountain. Finn, trailing behind, clapped his hands and shouted with childish delight, “Dad’s carrying Ms. Ray! Like in the cartoons! Is she your new wife?”
Graham’s face, in that instant, went stone cold.
He turned back and snapped at his son. “Finn, don’t talk nonsense! Your mother is my wife!”
Having yelled the defense, he stopped, stunned. He didn't know why the need to protect me had been so instinctive.
Vanessa, resting on his back, heard the remark. Her eyes narrowed in a brief, venomous flash before she quickly replaced it with an expression of pained vulnerability.
That evening, Vanessa let out a bloodcurdling scream.
She held up her phone, her face sheet-white, and shoved it toward Graham. “Graham! Look what Liz sent me!”
Graham took the phone. The screen showed a graphic, close-up photo of a mutilated rodent. The caption below read:
“You’re all next.”
This message was from a burner phone Vanessa had ready. Graham stared at the sickening image and then at my gentle, smiling face on his own phone’s lock screen. He was utterly defeated.
“How could she become this?” he whispered, his voice thick with exhaustion and bewilderment. “Where is the kind, thoughtful Eliza I married?”
That night, Graham sat alone in the hotel’s living area, drinking heavily. Vanessa sat quietly beside him, offering soft, steady words of comfort.
Under the weight of alcohol, Graham’s last line of defense crumbled. He turned to Vanessa. “When we get back, I’ll arrange for her to go into a specialized treatment center. I can’t let her continue like this. She’s going to hurt Finn.”
He thought he was making a sensible decision for everyone.
Just as he felt a cold sense of relief, the property manager called.
“Mr. Pierce? Your downstairs neighbor is complaining that your unit is leaking. It’s soaked their ceiling.” The manager sounded stressed. “We’ve knocked and knocked. No one is answering.”
That leak was my body’s decomposition, the result of cellular breakdown, dripping through the floorboards.
Graham, already irritated by me, was impatient.
“My wife is asleep. She’s sick and difficult; don’t harass her.”
“Just shut off the main water valve for the building. I’ll deal with the leak when I get back.”
After hanging up, he felt a fresh wave of resentment. He pulled up my contact and sent a final, scathing text.
“Eliza Sutton, the house is leaking and you can’t even manage that? What are you trying to pull? Clean up your mess before we get back.”
The message went unanswered. He scoffed and shut off his phone.
He didn't know that the Eliza who could reply to his messages was already gone.
On the afternoon of December 26th, Graham, Vanessa, and Finn finally drove home. Vanessa, in the passenger seat, was already planting seeds of doubt.
“Graham, she must be furious. She might have trashed the whole place.”
She squeezed his hand. “Please don’t get angry when you see it. She’s unstable. Don’t provoke her.”
Graham drove in silence, his jaw tight with building anxiety.
The car parked, the elevator rose.
When the doors opened, all three froze.
Our entryway was swarming with people: uniformed police, the property manager, and a few neighbors whispering and rubbernecking. The most jarring sight was two people in white coats, masks, and gloves—forensic investigators—walking out of our apartment.
The air was heavy with a strange, sickly sweet, coppery smell.
Vanessa instantly played the damsel, dramatically covering her mouth and shrinking behind Graham.
“Oh, God... Graham, she... she didn’t hurt herself to get back at you, did she?” Her voice was laced with a chilling mix of fear and triumph. “She’s so terrifying! To resort to this...”
A cold dread plunged Graham’s heart into his stomach. He pushed past the crowd, rushing forward like a madman.
“Eliza Sutton! What is the big fuss about?!”
A young officer immediately stopped him, his expression grim. “Sir, please calm down. Are you the homeowner? What is your relationship to the deceased?”
Graham violently shoved the officer aside, his eyes locked on the open door.
“I’m the homeowner! Deceased? Who’s dead? My wife is asleep in there! She has a temper, don’t scare her!”
It couldn't be. In his memory, he’d covered her with a blanket on Christmas Eve. She had threatened Vanessa with a knife just last night.
A living person couldn't just die and stay dead without him knowing.
Vanessa quickly joined in, trying to establish an alibi.
“Yes, Officer, there must be a mistake. My sister-in-law is fine. How could she possibly be dead?”
She pulled out her phone, showing the fake text message record. “Look, this is the threat she sent me late on Christmas Eve. And this is the picture she sent Christmas morning. How could she be dead?”
The neighbors began to murmur.
An older coroner, a veteran with a weary expression, stepped out of the apartment. He removed his mask, looked at Graham, and then at the hysterically babbling Vanessa. He threw out a single, cold line.
“You claim she sent you a picture late last night?”
He gestured toward two workers who were carrying out a stretcher covered with a white sheet.
“Based on the degree of livor mortis, the advanced state of rigor mortis, and the early signs of decomposition at the scene,” the coroner stated flatly, “the deceased, Eliza Sutton, died of acute cardiac arrest. The time of death is estimated to be at least 40 hours ago.”
The coroner’s eyes fixed on Vanessa and Graham’s ashen faces. He spoke each word with chilling clarity:
“Which means she died at approximately 8:00 PM on New Year’s Eve.”
“The question is, how did a woman who has been dead for two days manage to send you text messages and photos late last night?”
“Did she rise from the dead?”
