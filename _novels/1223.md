Three years into my relationship with Rhys Davenport, the Crown Prince of the East Coast Elite, we were finally supposed to get engaged.

But at the engagement party, he was nowhere to be found, leaving me to face the humiliating crowd alone.

His friends offered dry platitudes about the endurance required of an elite wife. They were mistaken. I took every penny Rhys had given me over those years and vanished completely from the City.

The truth is, I knew the end of my story with him the moment it began.

I was worrying about my next meal when I happened to overhear a girl sweetly clinging to his arm.

“Big Bro, our student council president has a huge crush on Sutton. Go sweep Sutton off her feet so I have a chance with him!”

Rhys just smirked.

“If you insist, then I suppose I must obey.”

Between the two of us, there was never a single shred of genuine emotion, not from the start.

1

The starting time on the invitation had come and gone an hour ago, but Rhys still hadn’t shown.

Catching the pitying, slightly mocking stares of the guests, I sighed, a gesture of mild regret, and slowly began to unclip the expensive high-jewelry necklace from my throat.

His friend, Grant, was leaning against the doorway, his voice thick with its usual condescension.

“Sutton, what’s the rush? Rhys got held up. You want to be a Davenport woman, you need a little more patience than this.”

I ignored him, turning to the mirror to unhurriedly take off my diamond earrings.

Another girl scooted closer, feigning concern.

“Sutton, don’t be sad. Rhys wouldn’t do this on purpose. He’s probably just held up by something more important.”

She bit down hard on those two words, her pretty face momentarily twisting with the emphasis. Watching her in the mirror, I suddenly smiled.

“Sad?”

I repeated the word, placing the earrings gently on the velvet tray where they made a faint, delicate clink.

“Why would I be sad?”

The dressing room fell silent for a moment.

I turned around, my gaze calmly sweeping over each of them.

“I wasn’t waiting this hour because I expected him to show up.”

Grant frowned, demanding to know what I was trying to do.

I stood up and began to pull down the invisible side zipper of the couture gown.

“I’m changing clothes. Can’t you tell?”

My tone was as casual as commenting on the weather.

“Sutton! Don’t push your luck!”

Someone nearby started loudly talking.

“Rhys has spoiled you rotten! Are you seriously trying to use a runaway-bride stunt to blackmail him? You walk out that door today, and tomorrow you’ll be nothing!”

The zipper reached its end, and the expensive fabric slid to the floor, revealing the simple white T-shirt and jeans I’d already put on underneath.

I bent down into the silk heap and retrieved the old canvas backpack—a bag that looked utterly out of place in this gilded room—and slung it over my shoulder.

Then, I looked at everyone in the room and answered their question very seriously:

“I was never ‘anything’ to begin with.”

“So, I’m not afraid to lose anything now.”

Without another word, I didn't wait to see the mixture of surprise and offense on their faces. I walked straight to the side exit.

Rhys was the ultimate prince of this elite circle, the undisputed leader of these high-society kids.

They had always looked down on me because my family was utterly insignificant compared to theirs.

They couldn't understand why Rhys was with me, and they always spoke to me with a barbed edge.

Even on the verge of becoming his wife, their tone remained one of barely concealed derision.

Rhys was the one who fled the engagement, yet they were all ready to dump the entire disaster on my head.

I should have argued with them, let out three years of pent-up bitterness.

But I didn’t have the time. My flight out of the country was booked for today.

I wasn’t surprised at all by Rhys’s non-appearance.

A week ago, the high-jewelry set he'd ordered for me had just been delivered. I was about to call him when I heard his sister, Cassidy, screaming hysterically in his study.

“You’re really going to marry that low-class bitch, Sutton! You only got with her to help me hook up with Dean, didn’t you? You didn’t actually fall for her, did you?!”

Rhys’s indifferent voice floated back, airy and dismissive:

“How could I? I could never like someone so boring. Relax. I’m just setting the stage for you, little sister.”

Cassidy’s mood changed instantly. She sounded delighted.

“Are you going to dump her at the engagement party, Bro? I knew a charity case like her could never fool you.”

A single wall separated us, but I could picture Rhys’s familiar, playful smile as he consoled his pouting sister.

What a picture of sibling devotion.

If the "charity case" being discussed—the one who was about to be publicly dumped at her own engagement party—hadn't been me, maybe I would have admired the scene.

It was no secret that Rhys spoiled Cassidy.

Early in our relationship, when he wanted to introduce me to his friends, he had a special evening gown made for me.

It was a beautiful pale blue, and I loved it.

When I stepped out of the fitting room, Rhys’s eyes lit up.

“Sutton, blue looks incredible on you.”

The spoiled young man, who usually had a three-minute attention span, spent the entire afternoon with me, helping me pick out accessories and waiting while I got my hair and makeup done.

That evening, I was still nervous. The hand clutching his sleeve betrayed my anxiety.

Rhys chuckled softly.

“Don’t worry. Everyone’s friendly.”

The atmosphere was good. His close friends and the girls from their circle were gathered, playing cards. They greeted us warmly.

“Hey, Rhys! Hello, Little Lady!”

Rhys arranged for a few of the girls to play poker with me, while he was pulled away by his brothers to play pool next door.

No sooner had he left than Cassidy walked in.

She looked me up and down, her expression clearly mocking and malicious.

“Ugh, isn’t that the dress I asked the maid to throw out? You picked it up and wore it. You certainly know how to choose cast-offs.”

I didn’t even get a chance to explain before Cassidy waved a hand to cut me off.

“Ah, whatever. It’s too big on me anyway. Consider it recycling.”

Hearing the commotion, Rhys quickly came out of the next room to intervene.

“What are you bothering your sister-in-law for? You don’t even own a blue dress.”

Seeing Rhys, Cassidy became instantly saccharine.

“Oh, but I like it, Big Bro! I don’t care, you have to buy me ten of them!”

Rhys laughed, indulging her.

“Alright, alright, you always get your way.”

Cassidy mumbled happily and settled into the seat next to him, contentedly enjoying the cake Rhys handed her.

Everyone’s expression in the room became awkward. The girls who had been acting like my best friends minutes ago suddenly found the floor endlessly fascinating, completely isolating me.

It was obvious to everyone that Cassidy was intentionally trying to humiliate me. Rhys saw it too, but he did nothing to help.

Only after Cassidy left to go play with her friends did Rhys lean in to quietly apologize.

“Cassidy’s got a weak constitution, she can’t get upset, so we always give in to her. I’m sorry I put you through that, babe.”

From then on, Rhys kept Cassidy and me mostly separated. I knew why. But I didn’t care.

Because every time I was slighted, the compensation—a random piece of jewelry or a gift—was worth a luxury condo.

So, what was a little humiliation? A person can’t choose pride over money.

Because everyone knew Cassidy and I were at odds, they never thought I’d last long with Rhys.

I never managed to fit into their circle, and when Rhys realized it, he didn’t say anything publicly, but he quietly funneled even more money into my accounts.

That’s why our engagement surprised everyone.

A week before the party, Cassidy insisted on throwing a bachelor/bachelorette bash.

She chose an ultra-exclusive members' club and invited the most notorious party girls in their circle—all stunning, flirty, and eager.

I remained unfazed. Rhys, however, frowned and muttered in a voice only I could hear:

“What is my sister playing at? If you don’t like this, we can make a brief appearance and leave.”

He put an arm around my shoulder, guiding me toward the lounge, but Cassidy cut him off.

“Sutton, you haven’t been to one of our parties in ages. I get why you’re uncomfortable.”

She was dressed provocatively, handing a glass of champagne to both Rhys and me.

“You know, in our world, this kind of socializing is normal. It’s a little different from a strictly transactional relationship.”

I laughed softly, took the glass, and took a sip.

I smoothed the fabric of my dress, my voice utterly calm as I spoke to the siblings.

“It’s fine. Have fun, but don’t stay out too late. Cassidy, take good care of your brother for me.”

Rhys looked momentarily stunned, clearly not expecting that reaction.

Cassidy, missing her brother's pause, smiled triumphantly and hooked her arm through his.

“See, Bro? Your fiancée gave you permission. What are you waiting for? Come on in!”

“Some of the girls who used to have a massive crush on you are here. Last chance to be a bachelor!”

My heart no longer reacted to Cassidy’s juvenile provocations. I simply gave Rhys a serene wave.

To my surprise, he grabbed my arm, his expression darkening.

“Sutton, what is this? Are you trying to push me toward other women?”

Push you to other women? You were never mine to begin with.

Amused, I looked up at him.

“Well, if I asked you not to go, would you stay?”

The lighting in the room was dim and suggestive, the music deafening.

I watched Rhys quietly. Before he could answer, Cassidy’s voice rose, a little panicked.

“Big Bro! You promised me!”

Rhys instantly snapped out of his daze. His Adam’s apple bobbed as he reluctantly let go of my arm.

“Sutton, wait for me to come back.”

He didn’t finish the sentence before Cassidy forcefully dragged him into the room. The last few words were swallowed by the bass, as if they were never spoken.

The moment Rhys entered, the women swarmed him—some pouring drinks, others leaning in to whisper, practically plastered to his side.

Rhys looked distracted, his eyes constantly flicking toward the doorway, as if waiting for something.

I stood in the hallway, took one last look through the crack in the door, and turned away. I didn’t look back.

He’d never know how much I hoped he would fall apart that night.

The more reckless he was, the more justifiable my departure would be.

Rhys didn’t fall apart. He came home around 3 a.m., smelling of smoke and liquor.

I was still awake, organizing paperwork for my upcoming study abroad program in the study.

He came up behind me, wrapping his arms around my waist, his chin resting on my shoulder. His warm breath, mixed with the scent of alcohol, tickled my ear.

“Why are you still up? Waiting for me?”

Perhaps it was the alcohol, but his voice was a little husky, laced with amusement.

I didn’t turn around, continuing my work.

“Yes. Did you have fun?”

“It was fine. The noise gave me a headache.”

He nuzzled my neck, his tone seeking praise.

“I kept checking my phone. You didn’t send me a single text.”

I honestly didn’t have the energy to placate him, but he was unusually clingy when drunk. He pulled back and looked into my eyes.

“Are you jealous? I swear, I didn’t touch any of those girls. Didn’t even take their numbers.”

I met his gaze for a long moment, sighed, and resignedly helped him into bed.

I first truly met Rhys next to a dumpster in the alley behind an off-campus bar.

I was arguing with the bar owner, who was trying to stiff me on my wages. The air reeked of stale beer and trash.

“You agreed to eighty an hour. I worked five hours. That’s four hundred dollars.”

I tried to keep my voice steady, but my hand was shaking, and not just from the cold.

The owner, cigarette dangling from his lip, squinted at me.

“That imported glass you broke? That was two hundred. The other two hundred is a lesson fee. The real world isn’t a university, got it?”

I was about to argue when a lazy, drawling voice cut in.

“Oh? What kind of glass costs two hundred? Let me see.”

Rhys appeared, leaning against the streetlight at the alley’s mouth. The light framed his perfect profile and tall, imposing figure.

Two equally expensively dressed, amused-looking men stood behind him.

The owner froze. He clearly recognized Rhys’s bespoke suit and his entourage, and his bravado deflated.

“Mr. Davenport? What are you doing in a place like this? It’s just this little worker, she doesn’t understand…”

“Cut the crap.”

Rhys walked past the owner without a glance, coming straight up to me. He took off his cashmere overcoat and, without a word, draped it over my stained, worn jacket.

The coat smelled clean, of expensive soap and subtle warmth, immediately blocking out the stench of the alley.

He turned back to the owner, his tone quiet but carrying undeniable pressure.

“The money.”

The man, who minutes ago was a bully, immediately fumbled for his wallet.

Rhys took the crumpled bills, didn’t look at them, and shoved them into my hand. Then he told the owner,

“The cost of the glass. You can collect it from the front desk at Davenport Industries tomorrow.”

The owner was nodding and bowing, barely daring to breathe.

“Let’s go.”

Rhys casually placed his hand on my shoulder, guiding me out. His friends whistled softly and walked ahead.

Clutching the crumpled four hundred dollars and the coat still warm from his body, my heart, already hardened by the constant struggle of my life, accelerated uncontrollably in the frigid night air.

He drove an expensive sports car, its interior so clean it looked untouched. He told me to get in, offering to take me back to campus.

The heat was on high in the car. It was so quiet I could hear my own breathing.

I sat with my head down, staring at the creased four hundred dollars.

“That kind of place isn’t for you.”

He spoke, his voice deep and pleasant in the confined space.

“I need the money.”

It was the simple truth. I was desperately poor.

He glanced at me, said nothing. A moment later, while waiting at a red light, he asked abruptly.

“What’s your major?”

“Finance.”

“Coincidence. My company is looking for interns. The hourly wage is much higher than what you were making, and it’s safe.”

His tone was casual, as if discussing the weather.

“Start tomorrow?”

I knew this was sudden, that something was wrong. There’s no such thing as a free lunch. Combined with the conversation I’d accidentally overheard between him and Cassidy days earlier, the answer was obvious.

This was a calculated meeting, the opening move in a hunt designed to pave the way for his sister.

Every rational part of me screamed to walk away. But I turned my head, looking at his long fingers gripping the steering wheel, the surprisingly low-key but incredibly expensive watch on his wrist, and his handsome, almost aggressively perfect profile.

He could effortlessly solve the problems I agonized over. He could offer a wage I couldn’t refuse. He could pull me out of that chaotic, disgusting alley.

With him, I wouldn't have to worry about my next meal or next semester’s tuition.

The car stopped on a quiet street near campus. He didn’t rush me out, just rolled down the window, letting the night air rush in.

“Why did you help me?”

I heard myself ask, my voice dry.

He smiled, his finger tapping lightly on the steering wheel. The streetlights played across his eyes, flickering.

“I find you… interesting.”

He paused, then added,
