When I opened my eyes again after death, I had somehow returned to the past - specifically, to the day I advised her not to quit her job. It was as if I had been given a second chance at life, a chance to change the course of events.

The house was a mess. Olivia sat dejectedly on the sofa, sighing. When she saw me come in, she finally smiled:

"Thank God, Lydia, come help me quickly! Since having the baby, the housework has been growing like weeds. It's driving me crazy!"

Meanwhile, her husband Jack was sitting in a chair, leisurely enjoying his breakfast. He was still complaining:

"It's just some trivial housework. How hard can it be? Do you have to whine about it every day?"

Their baby was lying on the floor, wailing loudly and persistently demanding his mother's embrace.

If this were before, I swear I would have helped her without hesitation. But now, with the knowledge of what was to come, I just stood calmly in place, pretending not to hear what she said.

"Lydia! Why are you just standing there like an idiot? The dirty dishes in the kitchen are calling your name. Can't you hear them?" Olivia complained to me in frustration.

But I remained standing in place:

"Sis, isn't this the life you love? How could I possibly interfere with your plans and interests?"

Olivia was shocked that I would treat her this way. She stared at me with reddened eyes:

"I'm your own sister! It's bad enough that you won't help me, but how can you say such hurtful things!"

"If you came here just to laugh at my misery, then get out!"

Jack put down the newspaper in his hand and spoke up in displeasure:

"I never imagined you were this kind of person, just standing there like a statue to gloat over your sister's suffering."

So he was aware of Olivia's pain. Yet he chose to do nothing and was now scolding me instead. How hypocritical!

I looked at Olivia's face:

"I hurt myself rock climbing yesterday. The doctor advised me not to do any housework. Sorry sis, you'll have to handle this on your own."

I took out the fake medical report I had prepared in advance. With this proof, she couldn't keep demanding that I help with the chores.

Olivia put down the broom in her hand.

"Why didn't you say so earlier, silly girl! Of course your sister cares about you! In that case, come back and help me tomorrow instead."

I couldn't help but smile. If she truly cared about me, she wouldn't have killed me in my previous life.

I looked at her face. After all, this was the sister who had loved me when we were young.

I still couldn't help but speak up:

"Sis, family and career don't have to conflict. Maybe you could find a job first to gain some financial..."

"Lydia! Is this how you help your sister? Taking care of the family is her job!" Jack angrily stood up and interrupted me. The baby on the floor also started crying loudly:

"I don't want mommy to leave! Mommy has to stay home with me!"

This chaotic environment was giving me a headache!

But Olivia smiled happily:

"See, Lydia? They both need me so much!"

"I can understand your cold-heartedness. Sometimes you're just jealous of my happiness."

Seeing her satisfied smile, I felt a chill run through my body.

I made an excuse to leave this hellhole. But halfway out, I realized I had left my purse behind.

When I returned to the doorway, I was shocked to find Jack passionately kissing Alice next door. The two were inseparable.

And my nephew Tommy was hugging Alice's leg:

"Mommy! You're my real mommy! That other woman is just our free nanny!"

This scene completely stunned me!
