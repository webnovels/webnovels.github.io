The night before my wedding, Liam Caldwell's adopted sister, Chloe, suddenly turned pale and nauseous.
He frantically scooped her up and rushed her to the hospital.
Half an hour later, my phone rang. "She's pregnant," Liam's voice was disturbingly calm.
I was about to offer congratulations, but then he continued, 
"It's mine…That night, she'd just broken up with her boyfriend. She was drenched and shivering from the cold. I just held her to keep warm, I never expected…"
"We need to keep this from Mom and Dad. I'm bringing her home to take care of her. We'll figure things out after the baby is born."
"The wedding will have to be postponed for a year. You can go explain and apologize to the guests."
My throat tightened. I couldn't squeeze out a single word.
He continued, "Oh, and one more thing. You need to quit your job immediately. Chloe needs someone to look after her. We can't have any accidents in these next few months."
I suddenly chuckled, "Alright."
He hung up, satisfied.
But he had no idea, I'd made a bet with someone else. 
If I wasn't married by my thirtieth birthday, I'd marry him.
And today? Today was my thirtieth birthday.
