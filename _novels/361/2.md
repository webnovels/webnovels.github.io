That night, my parents made Felicity and me share a room. I lay quietly, unable to sleep, my mind racing with how to become independent and leave this family as soon as possible.
After everything in my previous life, I understood: from the moment Felicity entered this home, my Mom, Dad, and even my brother, all became her sole possessions.
Late in the night, Felicity quietly got out of bed beside me. I squinted, pretending to be asleep, and watched her head straight for my parents' room.
"Waaah, Mom, Dad, it's so dark, my eyes hurt so much, I'm so scared!"
My overly compassionate parents, blinded by sympathy, didn't even stop to think how Felicity, in such an unfamiliar environment, could have found their room so easily in the middle of a sudden "eye attack."
They just hugged Felicity tightly, their eyes welling up with tears in distress.
"Don't be afraid, Felicity, Mom and Dad are here."
Felicity trembled, burying herself in Mom's arms, looking utterly terrified.
"Mom, Dad, can I really stay in this home? Waaah, just now my sister..."
Overhearing this, my heart sank. The next second, Dad stormed into my room without a word, pulling me out of bed while I was still pretending to sleep.
"What did you say to Felicity?! How can you be so insensitive? Felicity has been sick since she was little, and her background is so tragic. Can't you just give in to her?!"
"Don't be like that, Chloe is still young. Just teach her, she'll understand!"
Mom said she was trying to calm Dad down, but she was still holding Felicity tightly, not even attempting to come over and shield me.
In the end, they took Felicity back to their room, leaving me, dressed only in thin pajamas, shut outside my own door. Before, Mom used to check on me in the middle of the night, tucking me in before she left. They seemed to have forgotten I was just a seven-year-old child. I also feared the dark, the cold, and I was at an age when I needed my parents' love the most.
In my previous life, Felicity often did this. She would fake an eye flare-up, then, while my bleeding-heart parents were overwhelmed with sympathy, she'd invent baseless lies to badmouth me.
As a young child, I gradually realized the danger. Ever since she arrived, I, their sweet and adorable little daughter, had turned into a "bad girl" in my parents' eyes.
So, I began to secretly compete with Felicity, always trying to outdo her. Anything Felicity had, I had to have too. But Felicity was skilled at playing innocent in front of people, appearing gentle, timid, and always deferring. My parents felt even more indebted to her.
I fought with Felicity my entire life, but I could never win against her. Even my brother, who used to dote on me, fell under Felicity’s spell.
Everyone in the art world knew that the Davidsons had a pitiful, talented adopted daughter, Felicity, and a rude, jealous, good-for-nothing biological daughter, Chloe.
This time, I decided not to compete with Felicity anymore. I would live the life I truly wanted.
