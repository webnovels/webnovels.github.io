When summer arrived, my older brother, Liam, who usually studied abroad, returned home for a reunion, mainly to meet the legendary new sister, Felicity.
Just like in my previous life, Liam was utterly captivated by Felicity the first time he saw her. Felicity had wrapped a cloth around her face, stumbling around the living room like a blind person, then "accidentally" fell into Liam's arms during their first meeting.
Felicity blushed, saying in a delicate voice,
"Because I don't know when I'll go blind, I want to learn to live in darkness first, so I won't be a burden to Mom, Dad, and my brother later."
Felicity was so good with words. She subtly excluded me, her sister, and hinted to Liam that I didn't get along with her.
The passionate young Liam was too stunned to speak. The girl before him was as endearing as a delicate, innocent-looking heroine from a K-drama. He instantly vowed in his heart to take care of Felicity for the rest of his life.
My parents suggested we all go out and have a fun day to welcome Liam home. I didn't want to go. They were a harmonious family of four; what did I, their willful, jealous, spoiled, unloved younger daughter, have to do with it?
But Felicity just had to stir up trouble, shrinking into a corner and letting tears roll down her face.
"Mom, Dad, you should just take my brother and sister. It would be so depressing if I were there when you all have your family reunion."
Liam panicked, gently wiping Felicity's tears.
"Why would you say that? We're already a family!"
Felicity feigned shyness, trying to evade Liam's hand, while casting a timid glance at me, as if making a silent accusation.
Liam immediately glared at me.
"Chloe! Why are you bullying Felicity? How did you become this kind of person? You weren't like this before!"
What kind of person did I become? The ones who changed were clearly *you*. Mom, who once thought of me in every way; Dad, who was strict but gentle; and my brother, who always protected me—they had all become strangers.
I simply gave a cold laugh, looking Liam directly in the eyes.
"Why don't you let Felicity answer? How did I bully her? I even gave her my room; what else isn't she satisfied with?"
Felicity, guilty, instinctively avoided my gaze. Her frightened look only fueled Liam's protective instincts, and he shouted at me without restraint,
"It's that condescending attitude of yours that hurt her! Felicity just arrived at our house, it's only right for you to give in to her!"
Suddenly, I felt like an enemy who needed to be vanquished, and he, Liam, was the prince protecting his princess.
My overly compassionate parents only took sides.
"Chloe, your brother is rarely home; don't make him angry. Go apologize to your brother and Felicity."
I scanned this family, whose favoritism extended all the way to Antarctica, and answered firmly, word by word,
"Anything Felicity wants, I can give it up, because I don't care. But make me apologize? No way!"
After throwing out those words, I locked myself in my room, shutting out Liam's enraged shouts. Afterward, the family of four happily spent the entire day out. No one remembered to call to check on me, and no one remembered to bring me back any food.
If it were the me from my previous life, I would have been incredibly wronged, starving myself or even running away from home to make my parents feel guilty. But now, I knew such actions were futile and would only torment my own body.
I cooked myself a rich bowl of instant noodles, and while eating, I laid out the study guides I had secretly bought.
Since being reborn, I had diligently studied and improved myself, not daring to slack off for a single day. This time, I wanted to forge my own path through my own efforts. After careful consideration, I decided to study medicine.
