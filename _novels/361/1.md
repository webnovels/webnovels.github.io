I was reborn, back to the very day Felicity came to our home.
If I'd been reborn just a little earlier, maybe I could have prevented Felicity’s biological parents from dying, or perhaps I could have threatened to kill myself to stop my parents from adopting her.
But now, she was already home. It was too late for any drama.
Felicity was the daughter of my father's respected mentor, a renowned artist who had her late in life, and she was cherished like a precious gem. She showed extraordinary artistic talent but suffered from an unknown eye condition, with her sight fluctuating and the constant risk of blindness.
Her parents had taken Felicity everywhere seeking treatment, but they died in an accident, leaving young Felicity orphaned.
Felicity's childhood was truly tragic, which is why my parents, at first sight, decided to treat her as their own, even valuing her more than me, their biological daughter.
"Chloe, haven't you always wanted an older sister? From now on, Felicity will be your sister. Aren't you happy?" My parents looked at me with loving eyes, hoping I would genuinely accept this adopted sister.
My seven-year-old self, in my previous life, was indeed happy. I thought the world had given me a warm new family member, and I was eager to share my love with this gentle-looking sister. I never imagined Felicity was a thief, not wanting to share my parents' love, but to steal it all for herself.
"Chloe, Dad knows you're a sensible girl. Felicity's health isn't good. Even though you're the younger sister, we need you to help Mom and Dad take care of her. Can you do that?"
Before I could even open my mouth, tears were already welling in Felicity's eyes.
"I know my sister will have a hard time accepting me. Who wants to share their family's love? Sister, don't worry, I'll just go to an orphanage."
Sometimes I truly suspected Felicity had also been reborn. How could an eight-year-old girl be so manipulative? I hadn't even expressed any opposition, and she was already branding me as a jealous, difficult child.
Mom gently wiped Felicity's tears.
"Don't cry, Felicity, it's bad for your eyes."
"Why are you still calling us 'Uncle' and 'Auntie'? We told you, from today on, we're your Mom and Dad."
Felicity lifted her small, innocent face, clear tears still clinging to her lashes. She looked so overwhelmed and grateful, anyone would feel sorry for her.
"Waaah, I have a Mom and Dad now!"
At that moment, the three of them hugged, crying together, and no one remembered to ask for my opinion. Felicity just had that kind of power.
