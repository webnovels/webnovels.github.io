My husband cheated. The other woman was a new intern under him.

He bought her a house, a car, paraded her in front of his parents, and even threw a lavish wedding. 

Everything but the actual marriage certificate was hers.

 He even had our own son, Leo, walk as their ring bearer on their wedding day.

Liam called me cold, too engrossed in my career, neglecting him and our home. 

Even Leo echoed him, claiming I was no mother, devoid of affection.

 Apparently, I was destined to be a terrible wife, a horrible mother, so I graciously—or perhaps bitterly—stepped aside.

Now, let's see if this 'perfect' replacement truly satisfies them.

Today was Liam Caldwell’s wedding day. Even Leo wasn’t home. He’d just posted on Ins five minutes ago.

"Dad and Mom's wedding, our happy family!"

The post featured a photo of the three of them, beaming, a picture of pure domestic bliss. 

Anyone seeing it would have gushed, 'Goals! Relationship perfection!'

But two of the three people in that photo were undeniably my husband and my child.

Even through the picture, I could see the dazzling jewels Brittany Hayes wore. 

That necklace alone must have cost a fortune—hundreds of thousands, easily.

 Far better than what I got. When Liam and I married, we were fresh out of college, flat broke. 

We barely scraped together a few hundred dollars between us.

Back then, he'd never tire of telling me, "Eleanor, just wait for me. I'll make something of myself, I promise I'll give you a good life."

Later, Leo was born, and his company took off. 

In just five short years, it successfully went public, and his net worth skyrocketed. We no longer had to fret over monthly rent, or whether we’d eat our next meal. 

We didn’t need to work endless side jobs just to earn a few extra bucks.

But sadly, the man who once earnestly promised me a good life was gone. Now, it was Brittany Hayes who held his heart.

I let out a bitter, self-deprecating laugh, then hailed a cab to his company. 

Perhaps because of the wedding, he’d given everyone at the company the day off to attend, leaving only Mr. Henderson, the building's security guard, at the front.

He seemed surprised to see me, his expression tinged with pity. Yet, he still managed to say, "Madam Caldwell, you're here?"

See? Even the security guard remembered I was Madam Caldwell. 

So why could Liam so openly invite the entire company to his wedding with Brittany Hayes? Why was Leo so thrilled to welcome his new mother?

I smiled and nodded, saying little, just walking into the company building.

When Liam first started his company, he brought me here, slinging an arm around me, gesturing grandly. "Look! This whole empire I built for you."

I stayed by his side, watching it grow from a tiny studio into an entire building.

 I witnessed its meteoric rise, and it, in turn, witnessed our tangled web of love, hate, and betrayal—mine, Liam’s, and Brittany’s.

Soon, it would witness my death.

I sat by the entrance, recalling everything from the past, my breath growing shallower. 

Noticing my distress, Mr. Henderson frantically dialed 911. The last thing I felt was my consciousness fading, my body slumping sideways. 

I tried to sit upright, to die with some grace, but the strength had long since left me.

When the hospital reached Liam Caldwell, he was toasting guests with Brittany Hayes. At the mention of my name, his voice was filled with impatience.

"Eleanor Vance? Her affairs have nothing to do with me. Don't call me."

Even Leo, hearing my name, remained impassive. No questions, no curiosity, no defense.
