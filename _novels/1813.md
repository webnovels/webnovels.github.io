My pregnant wife was in excruciating pain, so I rushed her to the ER.

After filling out the admission forms, the doctor gave me an earful:

"Look, intercourse during pregnancy is generally safe, but you need to cut back! And when you do, take it easy on her."

Those words hit me like a bucket of ice water.

I'd been on a business trip for two weeks and just got back today. I hadn't even laid a hand on her.


I asked the doctor in a low voice:

"Could masturbation cause issues too?"

The female doctor shot me a dirty look:

"Don't try to pin this on your wife! Whether you're the one or not, you need to take proper precautions during pregnancy to lower miscarriage risks."

I nodded numbly.

After a chaotic night, Cassandra had finally drifted off into a deep sleep in her hospital bed.

She'd struggled with mild insomnia throughout her pregnancy. This was the first time she'd fallen asleep so fast.

I went to tuck the blanket around her, when I caught a clear glimpse of the red marks all over her chest!

Had she really cheated on me?

Right before I came home?

If I hadn't texted her that I was landing soon, would I have walked in on them?

The marks varied in color—some darker, some lighter.

Clearly, they weren't all from today.

But remembering her past allergic reactions and skin rashes, I pulled out my phone to look it up.

I found that some pregnant women do develop red rashes on their chests as their breasts grow during pregnancy.

Once again, I pushed down the paranoid thoughts swirling in my head.

To get back early to be with Cassandra, I'd pulled three all-nighters in a row at the office.

Now, watching Cassandra breathing steadily in bed, I couldn't sleep a wink.

I stayed by her bedside all night long.

When Cassandra woke up well-rested and energetic, she was shocked by the dark circles under my eyes:

"Babe, you didn't sleep at all last night?"

She glanced at the empty bed next to hers, looking confused:

"Didn't the nurse tell you? You could've slept there."

I stared at her unblinking, looking kind of dazed.

This face I'd cherished and protected was so beautiful.

"Babe, is there something on my face?"

I shook my head:

"No, I was just too worried about you and the baby. I couldn't fall asleep."

At that, Cassandra's eyes immediately welled up.

She affectionately looped her arm through mine and kissed my cheek:

"Babe, I love you."

But the doctor's words loomed over me like a dark cloud.

When we got home, I found cigarette ashes while cleaning.

Nobody in our house smoked. Cassandra definitely didn't.

Before she got pregnant, the smell of smoke would make her feel suffocated. After getting pregnant, she couldn't stand it even more.

So which guy had been to my house?

And felt comfortable enough to smoke in the kitchen?

Just then, Cassandra said to me:

"Babe, your mom brought over a chicken the other day. Could you make me some chicken soup?"

My mom had been here?

That made sense then.

After all, my mom was a smoker.

I opened the fridge and sure enough, there was a fresh chicken, already cut up.

After getting everything ready and putting the soup on to simmer, I called my mom:

"Mom, thanks for looking after Cassandra!"

"How's her appetite been these past few days? Is the morning sickness any better?"

My mom went on and on with advice about taking care of pregnant women, but then suddenly asked:

"Liam, did you get a new car?"
