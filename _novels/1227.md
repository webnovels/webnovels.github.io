Sienna had told me to dump him about eight hundred times. Each time, I’d hesitate, weeping into my hands.

"But he treats me so well."

Sienna would just roll her eyes and tell me to go jump off a bridge.

It wasn't until I found another package of lingerie—meant for Liam, but definitely not from me—that I finally listened to her.

Even when he was on his knees begging, I didn't look back.

I was driving over to Sienna’s place to give her the good news when her Instagram post popped up on my feed. A hard launch.

The caption read: How could the pavement ever understand the moonlight? She never knew you. I do.

The photo was intimate. Liam, eyes red from crying, and Sienna leaning in to kiss his cheek, a consoling angel.

Someone commented, accusing her of being the other woman.

She replied without a shred of shame: If she could be fooled by a few cheap pieces of lingerie I mailed to her house, how can she claim she really loves him? Besides, she's so plain. She doesn't deserve Liam the way I do.

I slammed on the brakes and whipped the car around.

I was in such a rush to confront her that I didn't see the oncoming traffic. I died on impact.

Then, I opened my eyes.

Reborn. Or reset.

I was back in the parking lot. I immediately blocked Sienna on everything, got into my car, and prepared to drive away forever.

That’s when a woman, her face masked in blood, started pounding on my window.

"Mara! Save me! That’s not me!"

1

I froze, hand hovering over the ignition.

Outside, the woman was slapping the glass frantically. Her features were a ruin of blood and gore, but I’d known Sienna for thirteen years. I knew the shape of her eyes, the set of her jaw. That was her.

But I had just left her upstairs. We had just argued. She was sitting in her living room fuming. How could she be here, battered and bloody?

"Mara! Unlock the door!"

She yanked at the handle, looking over her shoulder in terror. Like something was hunting her.

Thinking of what Sienna—the Sienna upstairs—had done in my past life, a chill crawled up my spine.

What if... what if Sienna had been replaced?

The Sienna I grew up with wasn't the type to steal a boyfriend. She wasn't competitive like that.

I looked at the desperate, terrified woman outside my window.

I decided to trust my gut.

"Quick! Get in!"

I blinked hard.

And suddenly, I was just sitting in the driver's seat. Alone.

I turned my head. The window was rolled down. The wind was hitting my face, cold and sharp. There was no one banging on the glass.

Did I... did I just nod off?

"Mara, get back here!"

Sienna came storming out of the apartment building entrance.

Her face was clean. No blood. Just anger.

"What do you mean 'he treats you well'? You don't want to break up with him?"

She looked exactly as she had in my previous life. Furious, protective.

"How many times has he 'accidentally' received lingerie from some mystery woman? And this time it was used! The mistress is practically dancing on your grave, and you're still nostalgic?"

The exact same words.

In my past life, whenever a package arrived, I’d run to her crying. And she would say, without hesitation: "Dump him."

But I always felt I should let Liam explain. And every time he did, I’d send Sienna a text: It was all a misunderstanding. We’re good now.

It used to drive her crazy.

But now, looking at her indignation, I remembered the post she made after she took Liam from me.

It wasn't in vain, telling her to break up for so long. Every time I mailed those packages, I was terrified she'd figure out it was me. I tried so hard to confuse her. Finally, she's not thinking with her heart anymore. I won.

I opened the car door and stepped out.

I looked down at her from the curb.

"Sienna. We’re done."

Her pupils contracted. "You’re ending our friendship over a guy?"

"Did I stutter?"

"Mara, we’ve known each other for thirteen years. You’ve only known him for three!"

Exactly. So why did you stab me in the back?

I stared her down. "Yes. We’re done."

"Fine." She pointed a manicured finger at me. "When he ruins your life, don't come crying back to me!"

She spun around and stomped back upstairs.

For a second, I felt a wave of dizziness.

She sounded so much like the Sienna I knew. The real one. If I had said those words to the Sienna I thought I knew, she wouldn't have reacted any differently.

I shook my head.

The truth of the last life had been revealed. I couldn't ignore it, no matter how much I wanted to believe in her.

Even though the bloody Sienna was just a nightmare, the Sienna upstairs who plotted against me wasn't any different from a stranger.

This friendship was ending in the ugliest way possible.

I got back in the car and rolled up the window.

As I reached for the gear shift, my eyes locked onto the glass.

There, printed clearly against the sunlight.

A chaotic mess of bloody handprints.

Right where the woman in my dream had been pressing.

I looked up toward the apartment complex. Behind the curtains of Sienna’s bedroom window, a pair of eyes seemed to be watching me dead on.

2

I wiped the window clean.

People from dreams don't leave physical evidence.

Sienna’s complex was full of unruly kids. I decided it had to be a prank.

When I got home, there was another package on my doorstep.

I opened it.

Purple lace stockings and a matching corset. Reeking of cheap, heavy perfume.

In my last life, my first reaction was to scream at Liam. Then I’d go cry to Sienna.

But now, I knew exactly who had sent it.

The image of the bloody face from my dream flashed in my mind. My hand clenched around the stockings.

If the Sienna upstairs isn't the real Sienna, then the real one must be...

I thought about it.

I needed to go back to her apartment.

To avoid suspicion, I baked a "peace offering" cake.

When I showed up at her door with a fruit cake, her first instinct was to slam the door in my face.

I jammed my foot in the gap, putting on my best pathetic face. "Sienna, please! That woman sent more underwear to provoke me! I know I was wrong. He’s trash! Absolute trash!"

Sienna eyed me with suspicion.

I pouted. "Please, Sienna. Without you, who’s going to help me destroy him?"

She let out a cold laugh. "Fine. I’ll forgive you this once."

The door opened. I walked in, my eyes scanning everything. I was looking for any sign of a struggle, any trace of a second person.

"What’s with you?"

She turned around, holding a knife to cut the cake. "You keep looking around. What, you think I’m hiding a man?"

She was technically right.

But it was strange. Other than her things and mine, there was no trace of a third person.

If the bloody Sienna from my dream was here, she would have left a trail.

I watched her slice the cake.

Maybe... maybe I was wrong?

"Did that loser boyfriend of yours finally make you lose your mind?"

Sienna forked a piece of cake and shoved it into her mouth. She chewed enthusiastically. "Hey, the frosting isn't bad this time."

I stared at her mouth.

My heart stopped.

Sienna was deathly allergic to mangoes.

I had deliberately filled the middle layer with mango puree to test her.

And this person, who was eating it without a care in the world...

Who is she?

"What's wrong?"

She looked at me, chewing on a piece of mango pulp.

My face went pale. My legs felt heavy, like lead.

"Nothing..."

"If it's nothing, then eat!"

She smiled and handed me a fork.

I hesitated, taking it. Under the sleeve of my sweater, my other hand had already dialed 911 on my phone.

My hand trembled as I reached for the cake.

Slap!

Her expression darkened instantly. She smacked my hand away.

"What are you doing?"

"Sienna?" I looked at her, shocked by the sudden shift in her demeanor. My heart hammered against my ribs.

"Why are you trying to eat the mango?"

She stared at me with intense, terrifying focus.

My breathing hitched. Did she know? Did she know I was testing her?

"You're allergic to mangoes. Did you forget?"

"What?"

I pointed at myself.

Me? Allergic to mangoes?

Since I was a kid, mango had been my favorite fruit. Sienna was the one with the allergy.

"Did that guy drive you crazy? You forgot your own fatal allergy?"

Sienna glared at me.

I looked at her. I put the piece of mango from the fork into my mouth.

I stared right back. "Sienna, watch closely. The person allergic to mangoes has never been me. It's you."

Her face went white. "Mara..."

"So, tell me. Who the hell are you?"

She looked at me in shock.

"Speak!"

I stood up to grab her collar.

Suddenly, my throat seized up. Tighter than a vise.

I fell to my knees, clawing at my neck. I looked down at my arm and saw angry red hives erupting across my skin.

"I told you! I told you that you were allergic, why won't you listen!"

Sienna was on her phone, screaming. "Hello? 911? My friend is having a severe allergic reaction! Mangoes! Please hurry!"

Mango allergy...

Me?

That’s impossible.

Sienna was the one allergic to mangoes. Always.

Thud.

I collapsed onto the floor. The last thing I heard was Sienna’s frantic, terrified voice calling my name.

When I woke up in the hospital, I still refused to believe I was the one with the allergy.

Until the diagnosis report was thrown in my lap.

The doctor frowned. "You were admitted to this very ward as a child for acute anaphylaxis. Did I not tell you explicitly that you could never touch a mango again? Not even the juice?"

I looked at the words Mango Allergy typed clearly on the paper.

I turned a look of disbelief toward Liam.

He sighed, sitting by the bed. "Mara, when we first started dating, you told me you were allergic. I’ve been keeping mangoes away from you for three years. Did you really forget?"

My mind wasn't on the cheating anymore.

I crushed the medical report in my fist.

A terrifying thought took root in my brain.

What if... what if I’m the one who’s sick?

Not just the allergy. But everything else.

That afternoon, I found myself sitting in the psychiatric ward.

"I am absolutely certain the lingerie I received wasn't fake."

I dumped the pile of lace and silk onto the doctor’s desk.

The psychiatrist raised an eyebrow.

"So, I don't believe that what's happening to me is illogical. Take the underwear. Take the bloody handprints on my car. The mango allergy... maybe that was an accident."

I had just been reborn, after all. Maybe I got some wires crossed during the reset.

But Sienna’s betrayal in my past life—that wasn't a mistake.

The doctor adjusted her glasses and sighed. "You're right. These objects are real. But the lingerie..."

She turned my phone around and slid it across the desk. "I found a different story on your device."

The Amazon app was open. It was logged into a secondary account.

I clicked on the order history.

Page after page.

It was all lingerie.

The most recent purchase? Purple lace stockings and a corset. And a bottle of heavy perfume.

I slumped back into the chair.

For the past year... all those packages I received...

I bought them?

I looked over at Sienna.

Does that mean... she actually thought Liam was cheating on me? That she was trying to protect me?

And Liam.

He sat beside me, holding my hand, and sighed. "So you were buying them for me? I thought someone was trying to break us up, pretending to be a mistress. I spent months trying to track down the sender."

The doctor pushed her glasses up her nose again. "As for the bloody handprints, I asked a friend in law enforcement to pull the street surveillance."

She played the video on her tablet.

It showed me stumbling down the stairs. My hands were covered in red paint or dye from somewhere. I looked drunk, unable to figure out the door handle.

I smeared red handprints all over the window and the handle.

I accidentally triggered the window to roll down.

Finally, I managed to open the door, got in, and passed out in the driver's seat.

When I woke up in the video, I looked at the open window with total confusion.

"So, Ms. Mara. The bloody handprints? You left them."

I stared in disbelief as she placed a diagnosis on the table.

Delusional Disorder.

She spoke calmly. "Or perhaps a form of dissociative identity disorder. You do things that are out of character, and then you forget them. Based on the timeline, you’ve been suffering from this for a while."

So...

In my past life, when I thought Liam was cheating and Sienna was stabbing me in the back...

It was all me? I was directing the whole play?

Liam gripped my trembling shoulders and pulled me into a hug. "It’s okay. I actually noticed something was off. I’m ready to face this with you."

Sienna grabbed my hand too. "Don't be scared, bestie. We’ve known each other for thirteen years. We can get through anything. I’ll help you get better."

Tears welled up in my eyes.

No one betrayed me.

From start to finish, it was just my broken mind.

"Doctor? Is it curable?" Liam asked, his voice full of worry.

The doctor looked down, writing a prescription. "It can be controlled with medication. At the very least, she won't see things that aren't there, and she won't act out anymore."

Liam squeezed me tighter. "See? There's a solution. Don't be afraid."

I nodded vigorously.

I looked at Sienna.

No, I should say... the Sienna I was hallucinating.

Because standing right behind the Sienna holding my hand... was the bloody woman again.

"Mara..."

She took a step forward, leaving a wet, red footprint on the tile.

"I told you... that's not me."

I took a deep breath and closed my eyes.

"What is it?" the doctor asked.

"Nothing. Just another hallucination," I said, pointing behind Sienna. "I see the bloody version of Sienna again."

The doctor smiled gently. "Don't worry, once you take the meds..."

She followed my finger.

Her words died in her throat.

"AAAAHHH!"

She fell out of her chair, scrambling backward.

"Run! Run!"

Sienna turned around.

Her face went pale at the exact same moment Liam's did.

"RUN!"

The doctor shoved me aside and bolted out the door.

The last thing I remember was the back of my head cracking against a metal filing cabinet.

Then, darkness.

When I woke up, I was in a hospital bed.

Liam let out a breath and stroked my hair. "Does it hurt? Do you know who I am? You didn't knock yourself stupid, did you?"

"Liam!"

I grabbed his wrist. "Where is Sienna?"

"You rang?"

Sienna walked in the door carrying three takeout containers. "I go out to get us food and you miss me already?"

I froze. "How are you guys so calm?"

Sienna blinked. "What do you mean? The doctor said it’s just a mild concussion. You just bumped your head."

"No!" I tried to sit up. "You saw it! Both of you! Why are you acting like nothing happened?"

Sienna blinked again. "Saw what?"

"You!"

"I'm right here."

"No... the other one! The bloody one!" I gestured wildly, frustration boiling over. "You definitely saw her! You guys screamed!"

Their expressions shifted. A micro-second of a glance passed between them.

Sienna stepped forward and hugged me. "Okay, Mara, relax. You fell. You hit your head. You're hallucinating again."

"It wasn't a hallucination!" I pushed her away. "You saw it. I know you saw it! You were terrified!"

"Okay, okay."

A hand clamped over my mouth.

Liam cleared his throat. "Honey, you're remembering it wrong."

"I am not!"

"Really, Mara. We..." Sienna looked at Liam again. "We didn't see anything."

I nodded slowly. "Fine. You didn't see it. But someone else definitely did."

I swung my legs out of bed.

I marched down the hall and kicked open the door to the psychiatrist's office.

I pointed a finger at the doctor from before.

"She saw it!"
