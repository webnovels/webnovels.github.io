Olivia's choice of Jake was partly about "boredom and excitement", but more about psychological needs.

They both grew up in small towns, fighting their way to the big city. There's a sense of kindred spirits there. Olivia sees a bit of herself in Jake.

Olivia and I come from very different backgrounds.

As she puts it, she struggled for 20 years just to have the chance to drink coffee with me at Starbucks.

Between us, even though she now has high social status, there's still deep-rooted insecurity. Whenever we go somewhere fancy, she can't help but feel nervous, always observing others first.

But with Jake, given her absolute advantage in economic and social status, she must feel much more relaxed and empowered.

Plus, in their hometown there's a backwards notion that a woman's success isn't just about how much she earns or achieves, but how many men she can attract.

We discussed this topic back in college. Olivia vehemently criticized that view.

Unfortunately, ideas ingrained over many years become part of one's core. They can't be easily erased just by adopting the right values.

As for Jake, I won't speculate on whether he truly loves Olivia.

In the adult world, relationships are often just about mutual benefit.

When Jake interned with me years ago, he repeatedly expressed envy of my background, career and marriage.

So from my perspective, by being with Olivia, he gains material support. Emotionally, he probably feels like he's finally surpassed me in something.

"Here are their photos, boss. This is all we've got so far," the PI handed me several pictures. "Do you want to go to court now, or wait a few more days?"

I looked at the photos of them coming and going together, feeling conflicted.

Past vows of eternal love, no match for the passage of time.

"Christmas is in a couple days," the PI glanced at my expression cautiously. "Maybe you want to think it over some more?"

"In my line of work, you see a lot of dirty business," the PI said. "To be honest, women who never stray in their whole lives are pretty rare."

For a moment I wavered, but finally just said, "Keep a close eye on them for me."
