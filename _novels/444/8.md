That night, I met some friends at a bar. Surrounded by the noisy crowd, all I could picture was those two in bed together.

I got home at midnight. Olivia wasn't back yet.

I went into the study and reached for the computer. Before I even touched it, I knew why Olivia had taken twice as long to reach Jake after leaving the restaurant.

She'd come home first. Someone had used my computer.

Everyone has their own computer habits. My left and right eyes have different degrees of nearsightedness, plus my right eye has astigmatism. So I keep the computer slightly tilted on the desk.

Olivia knows this house too well. So well that she forgot to pay attention to these details.

The computer use history had been cleared.

Apart from some cutting-edge academic materials, the most important thing on my computer was the paper I was currently writing. Something Jake could directly use.

Once published in an academic journal, the paper would boost my industry ranking.

I don't want to assume the worst intentions from Olivia and Jake, but I have to prepare for the worst case scenario.

Although I only started writing that paper recently, I had been preparing for three years, analyzing thousands of cases and investing huge amounts of time and energy.

[Stealing my academic work is even more despicable than stealing my woman!]
