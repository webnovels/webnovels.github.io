The next day, I did two things.

First, "I went to a law firm and hired a lawyer to advise me on next steps."

The lawyer first affirmed my actions from the night before - don't confront her yet. Get everything prepared before showing your hand. You want to catch her off guard.

He was slightly concerned about the lighter: "You were a bit rash there. Given your wife's intelligence, she'll quickly suspect you planted it."

I replied, "She has no proof. I bought that lighter recently when getting cigarettes. It's not my usual brand."

The lawyer told me to be careful not to slip up, then recommended "three steps plus one additional suggestion."

"Step 1: Collect evidence of her infidelity."

"Step 2: Apply to the court for asset protection based on the evidence."

I don't need to compile a detailed list of assets. Just provide leads on the assets and apply for court protection. The court can then take protective measures.

"Step 3: File for divorce, request dissolution of the marriage. The judge will determine how to divide marital assets based on the evidence."

Additional suggestion: "If Olivia purchased any high-value items for her lover during the marriage, like a house or car, that's considered misappropriation of marital assets. I can legally reclaim those."

"The second thing I did was hire a private investigator to gather evidence of Olivia's affair."

This person is technically called a 'private investigator', though less politely they're known as 'paparazzi'. They often help dig up celebrity gossip too.

My requirements were:

"A. I want to know who the other man is and how long it's been going on."

"B. Dating photos that prove their relationship, like kissing or entering a hotel."

"C. I want to know if Olivia has given him any expensive gifts, like a house or car."

The PI readily agreed, though his fee wasn't cheap.
