Fame may seem intangible, but it brings very real benefits.

The revenue of my practice skyrocketed.

There's a saying: "A man's confidence and status come from money."

Because I was earning more, my position at home also rose. I felt more secure and was almost certain Olivia wouldn't cheat. But reality slapped me hard in the face...

The day after I first noticed something off, I picked her up from work and hugged her as usual.

The seed of doubt had been planted in my mind about her clothes. Seeing her suspiciously clean outfit again, I slipped a lighter into her coat pocket without hesitation.

Then I pretended nothing had happened and cheerfully took her out to dinner.

During the meal, she went to the bathroom once for a full ten minutes. When she came back, she looked uneasy.

"What's wrong?" I asked.

"Nothing, just some work stuff," she replied.

"Do you need to go back to campus?"

"No, I'll deal with it tomorrow."

We were both putting on an act - me playing the clueless husband, her selling the 'stressed about work' story.

When we got home, she took off her coat and grabbed her phone to shower. I felt in her coat pocket - the lighter was gone.

Classic guilty behavior.

I tiptoed to the bathroom door. First I heard the 'ding' of an incoming SnapChat message, then her lowered voice, sounding annoyed:

"Who else would it be? No need to explain!
...
I'm at home, we'll talk tomorrow!"

My heart sank.

Before we got married, we had both expressed the same view: "Zero tolerance for cheating, no compromises."

I backed away, poured myself a drink, and sat on the couch pondering my next move...

We don't have kids, so divorce would only involve dividing assets.

Apart from our fixed assets - house, car, collectibles and savings - Olivia manages all our joint finances. She handles the stocks, funds and insurance policies. All the linked bank cards are with her. I hardly ever ask about it...

"Honey, what made you decide to have a drink tonight?" Olivia came out of the bathroom, toweling her hair.

"Just to set the mood," I raised my glass in her direction, with a hint of invitation. "I saw you go straight to shower when you got home, so I thought you... Or am I wrong?"

"You're right," she straddled my lap and kissed me, arms around my neck.

Two people with zero interest, both pretending to be in the mood.

I still felt sick to my stomach, like I'd swallowed a dead fly, but I kept reminding myself: "Don't let her realize I know."

I've seen many divorces. No matter how passionate the couple once was, few remain civil when it comes to dividing assets. Most turn ugly.

I didn't want to see her ugly side, nor did I want her to see mine. So the best approach was to "elegantly calculate everything in advance."

I'm a selfish person. I don't want years of hard work to benefit someone else.
