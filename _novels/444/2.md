Olivia and I met in college. We both did our bachelor's and master's degrees consecutively - me in psychology, her in math. Everyone said we were a power couple when we started dating, a collision of two rational minds.

We got married right after finishing our master's degrees, to no one's surprise.

She became a lecturer at the university, teaching undergrads while pursuing her PhD. With my advisor's support and my parents' financial help, I opened my own psychological counseling practice.

I majored in applied psychology, with hypnotherapy as my specialty.

Psychology got a late start in the US. In the early days, people were more skeptical than accepting of psychology, let alone hypnosis. They thought the whole field was a scam.

My practice struggled at first, but slowly improved. After successfully handling a few big cases, I gained some renown in the industry.
