Death? I once attempted it when the astronomical medical bills almost crushed me. On Nora's second birthday, I mixed sleeping pills into the milk, intending to leave with her. When the thick smoke filled the air, she woke up first. She wobbled over to me, her small hands clumsily pressing against my chest. Her childish cries alerted the neighbors, and they eventually saved us. After that, I dared not think of dying again. Even though I've thought about it countless times, I always wake up at the last moment. I can't die. Nora's and my mother's lives are more important than mine. Especially my mother. I've already let her die once; I can't let her endure it a second time. So I choose to live, by any means necessary.

A phone ringing interrupted the confrontation. Rowan saw the caller ID, let go of me, and got in the car. Seeing Celeste's name on the screen, I couldn't help but sneer. Rowan, Rowan, after all these years of torment, you still ended up leaving Iris behind.

Since our reunion that night, he's been showing up frequently outside my apartment. That Maybach always parked there for half a day. Gideon soon noticed something was off, but he didn't know our past and just thought Rowan was interested in me. That day, I dressed up alluringly, but he pushed me away coldly.

"Sage, you're not young anymore."

He pinched my chin: "If you've lost your value, you should know when to back off."

I forced myself to stay calm, trying to appear more charming.

"I have a collaboration proposal. Rowan refuses to see me, but you should be able to persuade him."

Gideon handed me a document, saying if I could get the signature, he'd give me fifty thousand. Fifty thousand would be enough for my mother and Nora to live on for a long time. I took the document to find Rowan, even bluntly stating the deal's content.

"What, one patron isn't enough for you?"

"Why don't I just give you fifty thousand, spend a night with me? After all, I was your first love."

For eight years, I've despised the version of myself that fell for him. At this moment, that disgust reached its peak.

"Rowan, you're revolting!"

I threw the document at his face, but it felt like tossing a flimsy piece of paper.

"We've done it before. If you're willing, the bedroom's over there."

His hand rested on my waist: "If not, take your document and leave."

I dug my nails into my palm and said word by word:

"Even if I fall to the lowest point, I'll never let you touch me!"

The deal fell through, and I lost Gideon's protection. He was surprised by my refusal and turned to flatter Rowan instead:

"That woman is easy to deal with. She has a mother in a vegetative state and a seven-year-old daughter."

"I heard she's depressed. Someone like her will soon come begging you."

Rowan froze, his voice trembling: "Who did you say?"

"Sage!"
