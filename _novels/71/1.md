When I saw Rowan again, I was in the arms of another man, entertaining guests.

After eight years, Rowan still had that noble appearance, exuding an air of authority. Beside him was a glamorous socialite.

Gideon pulled me onto his lap, his hand wandering around my waist.

Rowan's expression shifted from shock to disdain. I knew he recognized me.

After several rounds of drinks, I understood the background of the socialite beside him.

Celeste, the prized jewel of the Su family in Z City, and Rowan's well-matched fiancée.

Recalling the absurd past, I couldn't help but find it laughable.

My first love was holding a wealthy lady, while I was flirting with a graying man.

"Mr. Nolan, don't keep her to yourself. Let the guys have some fun too!"

Mr. Nolan's eyes roamed over me, his intentions barely hidden.

Gideon, always perceptive, pushed me forward for the sake of future cooperation.

I obediently poured wine for Mr. Nolan, who tossed a wad of cash in my face.

"In this sweltering summer, let's cool off!"

"Little beauty, ten bills for every piece of clothing you take off, what do you say?"

The room erupted in jeers, only Rowan set his glass down heavily.

I caught the ridicule in his eyes, took the money, and removed my jacket.

Someone swallowed hard, others raised their phones to take pictures.

Mr. Nolan deliberately scattered the bills on the floor.

I knelt on the carpet, picking them up one by one.

Until Rowan's shoe stepped on the last bill, looking down at me:

"Even as a mistress, you've developed a superiority complex? Truly cheap to the core!"

I looked up with a sweet smile: "Boss, could you please lift your foot?"

Rowan hesitated for a few seconds, then moved his foot after Celeste softly persuaded him.

I was about to continue my act when a voice suddenly interrupted the scene:

"Stop!"
