The night before my wedding, Owen’s “girl friend”—Anya—burnt down my house while I was gone.

She’d been hosting a backyard barbecue, tossing the unextinguished charcoal embers haphazardly across the new wooden deck.

The raging fire that erupted took the lives of the four bridesmaids sleeping upstairs.

I drove like a maniac to get there, only to collide with the scene: firefighters carrying four charred bodies out on stretchers.

I collapsed, sobbing, unable to tell which was my sister, Lily, and which were my best friends, Zara, Brooke, and Leah.

But the one person who had managed to escape, Owen, was standing there, holding Anya close and whispering soft comforts.

“It was an accident, Anya. It’s not your fault. I’ve got you. No one is going to touch you.”

The hatred was so sharp it felt like a physical wound. I spat out a mouthful of blood, then spent every waking moment gathering evidence to take Anya to court.

Yet, before the case even made it to the courthouse, Owen destroyed every piece of evidence.

He was furious, his face a mask of righteous anger. “Those four people are never coming back, Sienna. Do you have to force Anya to kill herself, too?”

With nowhere left to turn, I walked the streets in a haze of despair until Anya found me and ran me over. I was dead before I hit the ground.

Then I opened my eyes.

I was back. Back to the day before the wedding.

I immediately invented an excuse to move my bridesmaids to a suite at The Langham hotel.

But that very night, a fire blazed up again, and four women were dead.

My heart plummeted. Who were they? And how had they ended up sleeping upstairs in my house?

1

After securing Lily and my three best friends at the hotel, I messaged Owen to cancel the wedding.

I told him to grab his friends and any of his own brothers who might have been there and leave the property immediately.

I thought I had been careful enough. I thought I had neutralized the threat.

But by dawn, I was getting a call about the villa being engulfed in flames.

“They’re going to get what they deserve,” a neighbor hissed from the crowd gathered outside the yellow tape. “They had time to run upstairs and save people, but they just…”

“I heard they were supposed to get married tomorrow, and he was carrying another woman out naked. They took forever to call the fire department.”

“Those two almost burnt down my house when they didn’t put out their coals. What gives them the right to hug each other like that?”

Flames clawed at the sky. I pushed through the onlookers just as the firefighters carried out four charred bodies.

A spine-chilling coldness crawled over me. It was the same as the last life—I’d been called away for an urgent work meeting, and when I returned, this was the devastation I found.

But my four bridesmaids were safe at the hotel. So who were the victims this time?

I looked toward Owen. He looked exactly as he had before.

There was no hint of guilt for the lost lives, only deep concern for his “girl friend,” Anya.

“This isn’t your fault, Anya. We have to blame Sienna…”

He stopped mid-sentence as his eyes landed on me, and his expression instantly hardened.

“Where have you been? Look at the mess you’ve caused. I told you during the renovation not to use wood decking in the courtyard. Now people are dead. Are you satisfied?”

His self-righteous blame-shifting was the last straw. I rushed forward and slapped him across the face.

The sound echoed sharply in the sudden silence.

“I told you the wedding was off! I told you to leave! How dare you have a barbecue?” I screamed.

“Who are those four people? How could you stand by and watch them burn alive? Are you even human?”

A flicker of panic crossed Owen’s eyes, but he quickly regained his composure.

“The wedding was tomorrow! You can’t just cancel it like that!” he countered.

“Your bridesmaids must have slept too heavily, or what? How is that my fault?”

“You should be thanking me and Anya that we were still here. If we hadn’t been, your sister and friends would have been burnt to ashes!”

Hearing him, Anya, who had looked shaken moments before, instantly found her nerve.

“Exactly. This fire was an accident, but the house is yours. Your bridesmaids were here for your wedding. You have to take responsibility for everything.”

My whole body shook with fury. It was the same toxic playbook as before.

Last time, my closest friends and sister died because of Anya’s recklessness. I was consumed by grief, but Owen’s first instinct was to protect Anya and pin all the blame on me. Then, when I found the evidence to prosecute her, he destroyed it and watched as she ran me down with her car.

Even as my life was fading out, I remembered his final words: “Sienna, it’s my duty to look after Anya. I can’t let you ruin her.”

My breath hitched painfully. I dug my nails into my palm, forcing myself back to the present. “I won’t waste any more time with you two. There are four bodies, and I’m calling the police.”

They still didn’t know the victims weren't the bridesmaids.

But I had a sickening feeling the reason four people couldn’t escape the fire was the same as the last life. I had to find out their identities and the true cause of death.

Smack!

I’d barely pulled out my phone when Owen knocked it out of my hand.

“Is this how you think you solve problems?”

“Anya was only trying to help with our wedding. The fire was an accident. They were your family and friends, anyway—just write a big check and compensate them! What else is there to do?”

I stared at him, unable to believe my ears.

Even though I’d witnessed his cruelty in my previous life, hearing him defend Anya with such callous disregard still sent a shocking, splintering pain through my heart.

“Owen, four vibrant lives are easily solved with money in your eyes?” I whispered, my voice thick with hatred.

“You are rotten to the core.”

My hysterical accusation finally made him flinch. A flicker of guilt crossed his face.

“I… I didn’t mean it like that…”

“What Owen said isn’t wrong, Sienna. Accidents are compensated with money, aren’t they? Why are you being so aggressive?” Anya jumped in, her voice edged with faux-concern.

“Unless you know I’m up for a big promotion and you’re trying to tarnish my reputation?”

Hearing Anya, the slight guilt on Owen’s face instantly morphed back into anger.

He glared at me. “I didn’t realize you were so manipulative. People are dead. Pulling Anya into this won’t bring them back.”

“The backyard security cameras aren’t connected yet. Just tell the police you’re responsible for everything. When the dust settles, I’ll still marry you.”

It was the same, sickening pattern.

A single word from Anya was enough for him to throw me under the bus.

Once, we were supposed to watch the sunset on a mountain trail, but he left me alone because Anya called, saying she had a stomachache. I nearly got assaulted walking back by myself.

Another time, I was kidnapped, and the ransom was due in two hours. But Anya was upset over a work error, so Owen took her to an auction to buy a ludicrously expensive piece of jewelry to cheer her up. He delayed paying the ransom, infuriating the kidnappers, who cut off my little finger.

I had always forgiven him because he once nearly drowned saving me when I fell into the lake. I felt indebted to him.

But I paid that debt with my life in the past. This time, I owed him nothing.

“Well, your wedding is definitely off. Owen and I are leaving now. You deal with the rest.” Anya sneered, sparing a contemptuous glance at the four bodies lying on the ground, as if they were nothing more than stray cats.

Grief and rage filled my chest. As she turned to walk away, I grabbed her arm and dragged her back toward the stretchers.

“The fire started and they were burned alive upstairs, but there wasn’t a single sound. Can you honestly tell me you didn’t do anything to them?”

I forced her head down, making her look at the horrifically charred remains. Innocent people lost their lives because of her reckless stunt, and she was going to walk away like it was none of her business?

Anya gagged at the sight of the bodies, then began to scream.

“They died because they were unlucky! If you hadn’t asked them to be your bridesmaids, they wouldn’t have died!”

“It’s all your fault! Why are you pinning it on me?”

Seeing her terrified tears, Owen yanked me away, then delivered a savage slap to my face.

“Sienna, that’s enough! I felt sorry that you lost your sister and friends, but now I think you deserve everything you get.”

The slap was hard and fast. I stumbled, collapsing to the ground, my ears ringing, blood already welling up at the corner of my mouth.

“They’re dead! What good does making a scene do? Do you only feel happy when Anya is suffering?”

He pulled Anya into his embrace, his face etched with pure disgust as he looked at me.

His chest heaved, and his next words were even more inhuman.

“They were troublemakers anyway. Maybe it was karma that they died.”

“If you don’t stop this now, I will break up with you, and I will never marry you.”

My cheek was throbbing, but even though I had already hardened my heart against him, the pain still felt like I was being slowly flayed alive.

Why? Why did the man who once cherished me, who promised me forever, become so morally bankrupt the moment Anya arrived?

I stood up, wiping the blood from my lip.

“Owen, I wouldn’t marry you if you were the last man on earth. And you and Anya killed four people. Even if you stop me, do you really think no one else will call the police?”

A flicker of fear crossed Owen’s face. He was about to speak when a stern voice interrupted him.

“Police! Where are the victims? Who started the fire?”

Owen and Anya instantly went pale, speechless with panic.

The fire was out, and the neighbors had mostly dispersed. I quickly walked over to the officer.

“Officer, I’m the homeowner. These two were grilling while I was gone and caused the fire that killed four people,” I said, my voice thick with sorrow.

“I suspect the victims were drugged beforehand. Please, you have to investigate the truth.”

In the previous life, harmful substances were found in my bridesmaids’ systems. I suspected the same was true now. The only difference was I didn’t know these victims, so I couldn't yet contact their families to demand an autopsy.

“Sienna! Don’t talk nonsense! They were your bridesmaids. If there was a drug, you’re the one who must have given it to them!”

I knew Owen would try to frame me, but I couldn’t stop the shudder that ran through my body.

“Owen, you are truly despicable. I regret every second I ever loved a man like you.”

Owen flinched, staring at me in disbelief.

I ignored his complicated expression and turned back to the police.

“They died in my house, and the circumstances are suspicious. I need to know who they are and how they ended up sleeping on the second floor.”

The officer checked the scene and, perhaps sensing that this was no ordinary accident, his expression became grave.

“Don’t worry. We will take the bodies to the station and get to the bottom of this.”

As persons of interest, the three of us were taken to the police station to give statements.

By the time we finished, the sun was fully up. I pulled out my phone and messaged my assistant.

【Check my networked internal cameras, and get the neighbors’ surveillance footage. Find out exactly who was sleeping upstairs in my house.】

In the morgue, I stood looking at the four bodies, so badly burned their faces were unrecognizable. I felt only deep sorrow.

Ignoring the stench of burnt flesh, I stepped closer to examine them.

I was just noticing a familiar necklace on the smallest body when the morgue door swung open.

Owen and Anya walked in side-by-side.

They saw me, and a strange emotion I couldn’t decipher flickered in their eyes.

“I have to admire you. Your own sister and three best friends died, and you’re still so calm, intent on pinning everything on Owen and me.” Anya sneered.

“Too bad. We have a big gift for you today.”

A deep sense of foreboding settled in my gut. The terror of the previous life—the ruined evidence, the car crash—enveloped me.

I lost control and lunged at Anya. “Aren’t you afraid of retribution for deliberately causing these deaths?”

“You are a snake. You deserve to die more than anyone…”

I raised my hand to slap her, but before I could touch her, Owen landed a vicious blow across my face.

“Sienna, you are the snake who deserves to die. Are you only happy when Anya is suffering?”

I clutched my cheek, my heart stinging. In his eyes, even in my grief over losing loved ones, I was not allowed to seek justice from the killer—because the killer was Anya.

Even though he saw Anya was the one baiting and provoking me, I was not allowed any self-defense.

My throat felt clogged with sodden cotton. Even breathing hurt.

“Anya’s death would be her just deserts,” I choked out.

“Do you two even know that one of the victims might be—”

“Enough!” Owen roared, cutting me off. He looked at me with cold dismissal.

“Say your final goodbyes to your sisters now. Don’t say I didn’t give you time.”

With that, he pulled Anya close and they walked out.

As Anya passed me, she shot me a knowing, cruel smile.

Less than four hours after leaving the morgue, I understood what they meant by their “big gift.”

Before any investigation could be concluded, I was informed that the victims’ families had signed compensation agreements.

They were dropping all charges and immediately requesting the bodies be cremated and buried.

My chest tightened with choked-off fury. Owen would truly stop at nothing to protect Anya.

I rushed to the funeral home.

The four burnt bodies were lined up, moments away from being wheeled into the furnace.

Owen stood there, cold and indifferent. Anya held his hand, a smug, contemptuous smirk playing on her lips.

I burst forward to stop them. “Stop! Owen, do you have any humanity left? You haven’t even confirmed their identities! How can you cremate them?”

Owen looked at me with undisguised irritation.

“How? By showing the signed compensation waivers from your friends’ parents, that’s how. They asked me to handle the rest. Now stop causing a scene.”

The moment he finished speaking, Anya presented three waivers to me, clearly bearing the names of my best friends’ parents.

“Look closely. Stop behaving like a rabid dog chasing after me. As for your sister, Owen has signed the agreement representing the family.”

My eyes went wide as I looked at Owen.

“You threatened my friends’ parents, didn’t you? And we aren’t even married yet! Since when are you a member of my family, let alone my sister’s next of kin?!”

Owen stiffened, then a flush of annoyance spread across his face. “Once this is over, I will marry you! Can you please stop this hysterics?”

Our commotion drew the attention of the other people at the funeral home.

Seeing the judgmental eyes on her, Anya immediately put on a distressed, tearful expression. She choked back sobs.

“Sienna, you brought your four friends to the wedding house to have a wild party, and you accidentally set the fire and killed them. I know you’re having a mental breakdown from the guilt.”

“But you already killed them! Can’t you even let them rest in peace now that they’re dead?”

Hearing her version of events, the surrounding people immediately started whispering and glaring at me.

“Having a party with escorts in the house and she’s getting married tomorrow? Disgusting!”

“Playing around and killing people. This trash deserves the death penalty!”

“My son jumped off a building after seeing his fiancée cheat! I’m going to kill this tramp!”

A crazed woman lunged at me, clutching my hair and yanking hard.

The sharp, searing pain instantly blanked my mind.

“It’s you filthy sluts! You weren’t faithful, and you drove my living son to his death!”

The woman rained blows down on me. I couldn’t dodge.

I screamed through the pain. “Owen! If you have any conscience at all, explain this! Now!”

Owen looked at my bleeding face, and a flash of pity crossed his eyes.

He took a step forward, but Anya quickly pulled him back.

He looked down at Anya’s distressed, worried face, then back at me, his eyes hardening with ruthlessness.

“Sienna, you made your bed. Now lie in it. If you don’t leave, I’m calling a psychiatric unit to have you committed.”

With that, he directed the staff to push the bodies toward the cremation furnace.

Pinned to the floor by the deranged woman, I was close to blacking out from the agony.

“Do you even know who you’re cremating?! If you don’t stop, you will regret this! Their families will never forgive you!”

But Owen wouldn’t even look at me, focusing entirely on comforting Anya.

Anya had killed people and was about to walk free. Seeing the bodies about to be swallowed by the flames, despair filled me.

“Stop! Who the hell do you think you’re bullying?”

“And which bastard forced my parents to sign a death waiver for me? I’m still alive!”

My sister, Lily, and my three bridesmaids, Zara, Brooke, and Leah, suddenly burst through the crowd, shoving the screaming woman off me.

Owen and Anya stared at the four very-much-alive women, their faces white with the terror of seeing ghosts.

Just then, my phone rang.

I looked at the video my assistant sent me, then back at Owen and Anya, my expression icy.

“I know who the four dead people are,” I announced, syllable by chilling syllable.

“They are Anya’s sister, Sasha, and her three friends.”
