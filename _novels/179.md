After a decade of marriage, he remained distant and indifferent.

I stood by him through tough times, so he assumed I could always handle them.

"Why hire a nanny when you're at home all day doing nothing?"

His disdain was obvious.

Yet he felt deep sympathy for his first love, even to the point of tears.

I divorced him, split the assets, and started my own business.

When we met again, he was working as a personal assistant for an older woman.
