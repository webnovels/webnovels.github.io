"My marriage was perfect. Or so everyone thought. My husband, Godric, was attentive, loving. People envied our life.

That was until the day he died.

He clutched my hand, whispering the name of my twin sister, Rowena, over and over.

That’s when I realized I was just a stand-in. A placeholder.

I woke up, reborn. Mom was holding up two photos, asking me to choose a fiancé.

""Darling, there's Godric and Jaxon. You prefer Jaxon, right?""

Everyone in town knew I, Willow, was head-over-heels for Jaxon Baker.

Last time, I’d had a ""pregnancy scare"" removed, begged, even offered to alter my lady parts, all for him.

“No.""

I shook my head. ""I want Godric.""

This time, if I could choose real love, I wouldn’t settle for a substitute."
