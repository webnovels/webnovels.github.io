“Sera, I said yes to Julian’s proposal!” Blair smiled, as innocent and charming as a child.

“Hm, congratulations.” I unconsciously tightened my grip on the book in my hand, my fingertips turning white, but I didn’t even notice.

Back then, I naively thought Blair truly loved Julian.

I refused to be the villain who tore them apart.

I’d consider my feelings for him just a long, beautiful dream.

Now that I was awake, I’d pay the price for indulging in it.

But in the end, Blair still ran away from the wedding.

And, she even took the wedding funds with her.

At the wedding venue, guests filled the seats, flowers and crystal chandeliers shimmered, everything arranged to the most luxurious specifications.

Julian, in his Italian custom suit, stood tall, but as he waited for Blair, he received the news of her elopement instead.

In an instant, his eyes widened, staring in disbelief at the empty end of the red carpet.

The composure on his face vanished, replaced by anger and panic.

“Where is she?!” Julian roared, his voice echoing through the entire hall, making the surrounding staff tremble.

Julian tore off his tie and flung it at the elegant dessert table, scattering pastries everywhere.

Then he stormed into the bride’s dressing room, and seeing the empty space, he became even more enraged.

He clenched his fists, veins throbbing on his forehead, muttering through gritted teeth, “How dare she!”

Julian rushed out the door, completely abandoning his usual image, his uncontrolled appearance a stark contrast to his usual self.

A few hours later, Julian returned, defeated.

He walked straight to me. “Sera, will you marry me?” Julian clutched my hand, as if afraid I’d refuse.

I knew he needed a bride today.

Whether it was to get back at Blair or save face.

“I…”

“Seraphina Miller, are you crazy? Can’t you see he’s just using you to clean up his mess?” Cole Hayes interrupted me.

“Miss Miller, so desperate to get married? You’re so desperate to get married you’ll take anyone, even a hand-me-down? Why not consider me instead?” Cole said casually, a cigarette between his fingers.

“What do you mean by that, Mr. Hayes? Are you openly opposing me?” Julian stared at him intently.

“Exactly what it sounds like.” Cole didn’t even spare him a glance, smiling. “So, Miss Miller, what do you say?”

“Yes, Julian.” I completely ignored Cole.

“Damn it! Seraphina Miller, you’re just determined to suffer, aren’t you?!” Cole smashed the champagne bar and the flower arch.

Then he turned and left.

Suddenly, a heavy rain began to fall.

The wedding venue was ruined.

And just like that, in such a miserable state, I married the man I’d loved my entire youth.

That wedding night, I didn’t sleep at all.

I was overjoyed, after all, I had waited for this day for so, so long.

I knew why Julian chose me.

His first love ran away, so naturally, he chose the next best option—the one who could help him the most.

He needed me to help him save face.

I didn’t care about any of that.

I just wanted him.

My parents were exasperated, but they spoiled me rotten and let me do as I pleased. After all, we had the means, so what was there to fear?
