Julian and Blair had been together for five years.

In those five years, his doting and favoritism towards Blair drove me insane with jealousy.

I had never seen Julian like that.

I forced myself to bury those feelings deep inside.

“I don’t want to marry someone I don’t love, please, Sera,” she pleaded, whining.

“Stop messing around, the wedding’s about to start.” I said, a little annoyed.

“Alright, fine, I’ll go get ready then.” Blair skipped off.

My thoughts drifted back to the past.

I absolutely hated horseback riding.

But I heard he loved equestrianism, so I signed up for riding lessons too.

On my first lesson, I was nervous and clumsy, trying to approach the restless horse, but I couldn’t calm it down.

Just as I was at a loss, Julian, wearing a dashing riding helmet, walked over with a confident stride.

He gently patted the horse’s neck, whispered a few words, and the horse immediately settled down.

Then he turned and looked at me, a smile in his eyes.

He patiently taught me how to properly hold the reins and mount the horse.

As he guided me hand-in-hand, I caught a faint scent of his cologne. His proximity made my cheeks burn.

“Thank you, Julian,” I said, blushing.

I’d liked him since childhood, but this was the first time I’d ever called him by name to his face.

The reason I liked him was simple: he was incredibly handsome.

“It’s nothing, Sera. Feel free to ask me anything you don’t understand.” When he looked at me, his eyes seemed to sparkle.

I nodded.

In that instant, my heart felt like it burst with fireworks.

Maybe he liked me a little too.

Was I really Julian and Blair’s matchmaker?

I asked myself countless times.

At a lavish private yacht party, I didn’t like crowds, so I stood alone on the deck, enjoying the breeze.

The sea wind gently lifted my hair. As I was lost in thought, a magnetic voice suddenly came from behind me: “Standing out here in the wind, aren’t you cold?”

I turned, and Julian Thorne, dressed in a white casual suit, appeared before me.

He stood tall, his presence extraordinary, the limited edition Rolex on his wrist glinting dazzlingly in the sunlight.

“It’s alright, the view here is beautiful,” I replied calmly.

He smiled, walking to the railing and standing beside me. “Indeed, this sea always lifts one’s spirits.”

“I remember you don’t really like attending parties.”

“I came with a friend.” I glanced at Blair, who was flitting between various wealthy young men.

“Your friend? She’s quite beautiful.” Julian followed my gaze.

Blair that day was in a custom gown, its train spilling like a river of stars, her exquisite makeup highlighting her striking features.

Yes, I bought it for her.

“Sera, I’ve never been to a yacht party!” she looked at me pitifully. “Please, please, take me!”

My heart suddenly softened, I gave her a makeover and brought her along.

“So, Mr. Thorne, is she your type?” I asked him boldly, secretly testing the waters. “Do you want me to introduce you?”

I waited for a long time, so long I thought Julian wouldn’t answer.

“No.” He waved his hand at me. “Let’s go, Miss Miller. Get back inside, it’s cold.”

He said he didn’t like her,

Yet his eyes never left Blair.

The next day, he began his relentless pursuit.

He pursued her relentlessly and patiently for almost a year, making sure everyone knew it.
