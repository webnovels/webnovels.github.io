I’d loved Julian Thorne for a full decade.

But he, he never knew.

The day he married me, I didn’t sleep a wink.

I’d longed for this day for so, so long.

The day Julian Thorne and I got married, it poured outside.

Originally, the one Julian was supposed to marry was Blair Thompson.

But on their wedding day, Blair took the wedding funds and ran, abandoning the ceremony.

Blair, she was my best friend.

Back in university, she was incredibly introverted, barely spoke, and came from no significant background. Nobody wanted to hang out with her.

Our university was an elite one, full of students from old money and powerful families.

Later, I learned Blair had forced her parents to borrow money from everywhere just to get into the school because she was determined to bag a wealthy husband.

The lazy afternoon sun spilled onto the garden path.

I was heading to the office to go over a paper with a professor when I heard a commotion around the corner.

A few entitled brats had cornered a young girl.

They were spewing all sorts of filthy language.

The girl had a large backpack, her body curled into a ball, eyes filled with tears, staring timidly at the aggressive faces surrounding her.

Liam Hayes ripped off the girl’s hat, threw it to the ground, and stomped on it.

Lucas Thorne snatched her phone, fiddling with it, letting out strange cackles now and then.

The girl pleaded, her voice trembling, “Please, give me my things back, I’m begging you…” But they ignored her, continuing their torment.

“Cole Hayes, is bullying part of the Hayes family’s values?” I said, my voice cold, staring at Cole.

Cole Hayes, the sole heir to the Hayes family, their future successor.

In this city, the Hayes family ranked first, the Millers ranked second.

“Maybe Miss Miller should mind her own business first?” Lucas glared at me, annoyed.

“You know the consequences if you don’t leave now.” I twirled my pen, speaking casually.

Cole gave me a deep look, then slightly raised his chin, signaling them to leave.

“Since when did Miss Miller start being so nosy?” they muttered as they walked away.

It was true, I was known in our circles for being aloof and reserved, yet that day, I stepped forward anyway.

My parents were always busy with business abroad, maybe I was just lonely too.

“My name is Blair Thompson, thank you for saving me just now.” Blair extended her hand to me.

“Seraphina Miller. Don’t be such a coward in the future.” I glanced at her.

But she just grinned and hugged me. “From now on, you’re my best friend!”

I didn’t like unfamiliar people getting too close, but that day, I don’t know what possessed me, but I didn’t push her away.

From then on, Blair followed me everywhere, every single day.

She chattered constantly, incredibly noisy.

But I never once cut her off.

Julian Thorne, he was utterly, madly in love with Blair.

At the most luxurious private club in the city, it was covered in Ecuadorian Royal Roses and Japanese Alpine Peonies.

A globally renowned wedding dress designer had custom-made a dream gown for Blair—gossamer-thin French lace, dazzling Swarovski crystals, every stitch radiating luxury.

The lavish wedding he gave Blair was the talk of the entire city.

That day, everyone who was anyone was there.

I watched it all in a daze.

Ten years of unrequited love, maybe it was finally time to end it.

Like a shell of myself, I escaped into the lounge.

Afraid that in the next second, I’d just completely break down.

“Sera, could you do me a favor?” Blair had followed me in, I hadn’t even noticed.

I looked at her, gesturing for her to continue.

Blair ran over, shaking my arm. “Could you help me elope? I don’t want to marry Julian.”

“Why?”
