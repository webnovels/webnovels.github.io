As soon as I entered, I saw Olivia and Lucas's matching shoes in the entryway.

His black leather shoes next to her white stilettos—they looked perfectly coordinated.

Actually, long ago, I had suggested to Olivia that we could be like other couples, wearing matching outfits and using couple items.

But she had dismissed the idea, saying we were too old for such childish things and it would be embarrassing.

Yet now, she was clearly enjoying it.

It seems Olivia hadn't disliked couple items—she just disliked the idea of doing it with me.

In the living room, our wedding photo had been deliberately defaced.

Someone had scribbled over my eyes in the picture and drawn a large X across my face.

Before I could process this, I heard playful laughter coming from the kitchen.

"Lucas, just stand there and be good. I promise this porridge will be perfect for your taste."

"Really? Then I can't wait to try it~"

In the kitchen, Olivia had her hair tied up, exposing her slender neck as Lucas leaned in close to help her tie on an apron.

Halfway through cooking, she didn't forget to scoop up a spoonful for Lucas to taste.

The two flirted and joked around, completely at ease with each other.

I felt like an intruder in my own home.

Just then, Lucas noticed me. "Jack! What are you doing here?"

"But it's good timing. Olivia just made some delicious rice porridge. Would you like a bowl?"

As he spoke, Lucas was about to go to the kitchen to get me some porridge, acting every bit the host.

Olivia quickly stopped him, giving me a cold look. "Lucas, that porridge was made specially for you. There's none for certain others."

"By the way, Jack, isn't it still work hours? Why are you home?"

"This counts as skipping work. That's a $200 deduction. Make sure you report it to HR later!"

After all this time, Olivia still didn't know I had resigned?

But I couldn't be bothered to explain. The resignation had been approved; she'd find out sooner or later.

I had more important matters to deal with.

"I came to see you. I need you to sign something."

I took out the divorce papers and handed them to Olivia.

Seeing this, Lucas immediately chimed in with fake concern: "Olivia, Jack must be here to apologize about the phone call earlier. Look, he even brought you a gift! I wonder if it's a car or a house this time?"

Hearing this, Olivia's expression softened. She also assumed these were some sort of gift to make amends, and signed without even looking.

It made sense. In the past, I often placated her this way.

Whenever Olivia was unhappy, I would secretly buy her jewelry or a car to cheer her up.

But this time, she was in for a disappointment.

"You've misunderstood. These are div—"

Before I could finish, Olivia haughtily cut me off. "Jack, just because I accepted your gift doesn't mean I've forgiven you."

"If you want my forgiveness, you need to apologize to Lucas first."

"Also, since you sold the apartment, Lucas has nowhere to stay. He'll have to move in with us for a while. You'll need to give up the master bedroom for him..."

"No problem," I replied.

Seeing me so agreeable, Olivia looked pleased. "Jack, if only you had been this understanding from the start."

I coldly interrupted her: "It's not just the room. I'm giving you up too."

With that, I turned to leave.

Lucas's eyes immediately welled up with tears as he stammered, "Jack must be mad at me. Olivia, I should go. I don't want to cause problems between you two."

"Don't worry about me. I'll be fine even if I have to sleep under a bridge..."

Every time Lucas played the victim, Olivia would melt with sympathy.

She immediately glared at me and snapped, "Jack, what's the big deal about giving up a room? If you don't want to, then don't. Why are you being so passive-aggressive?"

"Besides, Lucas is already in such a difficult situation. Do you really want him sleeping on the streets? If you keep acting like this, I swear I'll divorce you!"

Lucas quickly tried to mediate, while subtly fanning the flames. "Jack, you should apologize to Olivia. What if she really divorces you? What about your job?"

"The job market is tough these days, and you're not exactly young anymore. Without Olivia, what kind of work could you even find?"

Olivia snorted, also using my job as a threat. "That's right, Jack. You'd better apologize to me and Lucas right now. Otherwise, I'll divorce you and leave you with nothing!"

Olivia was certain I wouldn't dare leave her. She was trying to use this to force me to give in.

But I just laughed and tossed the divorce papers at her.

"No need for all that. We're already divorced."
