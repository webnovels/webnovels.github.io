Having been out in the cold last night, coupled with the lingering effects of falling into the lake, I woke up with a high fever.

In this unfamiliar place, I reluctantly called Chloe. Her voice came through, full of annoyance.

"It's the middle of the night, are you trying to kill me? Why are you calling?"

My throat felt like I was swallowing razor blades. I managed to croak out in a hoarse voice, "Chloe, I think I have a fever. I'm too weak. Can you bring me some medicine?"

The other end of the line was silent for a moment, then I heard her even breathing.

I laughed bitterly at myself. Chloe didn't care even when I almost drowned in the lake.

It was just wishful thinking that she'd bring me medicine now. I felt ridiculous.

I forced myself to the hotel lobby. With the help of the night staff, I managed to get some medicine.

"It's the holidays, your parents must be worried about you. Take care of yourself, young man," one of the staff said.

The staff even thoughtfully handed me a hot water bottle and a bowl of plain rice porridge.

My cold heart found a sliver of warmth at that moment.

Chloe, you couldn't even compare to the kindness of strangers. All these years, I poured my heart out for nothing.

After a night of tossing and turning, my fever finally broke. My phone vibrated, and Chloe's voice came through when I answered.

"Alex, what happened yesterday when you called? I was asleep."

I said coldly, "It's nothing now."

Jake snatched the phone. "Alex, why aren't you back yet? Chloe has a surprise for you."

Chloe immediately grabbed the phone back. "Alex, hurry back. I have good news for you."
