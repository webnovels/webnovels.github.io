I was barely clinging to life when the kind fisherman rescued me.

My body had already lost all sensation. The icy snow water clung to me, freezing instantly, making me shiver uncontrollably as if I were in an ice cellar.

The good Samaritan called 911 and had me rushed to the hospital.

My emergency contact on my phone was Chloe. The doctor called her, and her voice came through, dripping with indifference:

"He's a grown man, how could he fall into the lake fishing? It's New Year's Eve, I'm busy celebrating. I'll see him in a couple of days. What a hassle."

After she hung up, the nurse looked at me with profound sympathy.

Outside, families were celebrating together. The TV in the lounge was playing holiday specials, and I could smell people eating warm food down the hall.

But I was alone in a hospital room, far from home.

Last night, I thought Jake was deliberately blocking Chloe from answering my calls.

But the nurse had put her on speaker just now, and I heard everything crystal clear. I almost died, and she was still so cold to me.

If she hadn't insisted on having fresh fish soup, and live fish at that, I wouldn't have risked going ice fishing.

It was at that moment I realized my life meant absolutely nothing to her.

I pulled out my phone and dialed my boss's number.

"Mr. Sterling, is that remote development project still looking for people?"

On the other end, I heard his relieved voice.

"Of course! We're short on technical talent like you. It would be a godsend."

"But this assignment is for five years. Aren't you and your girlfriend getting married? Does she agree?"

"I'm not getting married."

A silence fell on the other end of the line. After a moment, Mr. Sterling said, "Young man, it's good to be able to move on."

"Alex, I'll help you apply. There's only one spot left, but time is tight – you'd need to leave in five days."

"Okay, thank you, Mr. Sterling."

I stayed alone in the hospital from New Year's Eve until two days after New Year's Day. Chloe and Jake finally showed up, fashionably late.

As soon as she walked in, she looked at me with disdain.

"You're such a grown man, and you fall into a lake while fishing? So useless. I was supposed to play cards today, and you ruined it."

For the past few days, I'd been eating nothing but bread and instant noodles in the hospital, while she was out feasting on lavish meals and playing cards. My heart instantly turned cold.

Jake, standing behind her, looked at me with feigned concern.

"Alex, that night, I thought you just slipped. I didn't realize you actually fell into the lake. I thought you were fine." He then chuckled, openly mocking me.

Chloe looked at me with a sneer.

"You messed up our whole New Year's. Hurry up and get discharged. Our whole family is waiting for you to cook for us."

So they only came to pick me up so I could go back and cook for them.

Every New Year before this, I'd gone to Chloe's hometown to wait on her entire family, old and young. I hadn't seen my own parents even once during the holidays.

This year, we'd agreed to spend New Year's at my house, but on the day we were supposed to buy tickets, Chloe changed her mind. She said her mom, being her only daughter, couldn't be left alone for the holidays. But I'm my mom's only son too, and I hadn't been home to see her in five years because of Chloe.

Jake chimed in from beside her, "Yeah, hurry up and get out of here. There's a ton of work waiting for you at home."

I looked at the two of them, feeling a strange sense of irony. So, the only reason they wanted me to come home with her was to make me work for their family.

Seeing Chloe roll her eyes at me, Jake's lips curled into an involuntary smirk, like a victor's provocation.

Chloe and I had a stable relationship for years, but everything changed after he appeared.

Ever since Jake's business failed and he moved back home, they hit it off instantly.

Whenever Jake was around, Chloe would unconsciously side with him.

If I showed even a hint of jealousy or anger, she'd bring up how they were just childhood friends and say I was overthinking things.

She insisted their relationship was purely platonic.

At first, I didn't think much of it, until I accidentally overheard their conversation.

"Chloe, you know I've never forgotten you."

"I specifically came back from the big city for you this time."

They were just using the excuse of friendship to openly carry on an affair.

Chloe and I started dating after college. I even moved away from my parents and came to this unfamiliar city alone for her.

My family and friends all warned me to think carefully, but I was willing to do anything for love.

I thought we'd be together forever, but it was just wishful thinking on my part.

Lying in bed, I replayed every little moment from the past. Chloe's cold words suddenly echoed in my mind.

"I've decided, we'll have Jake be the best man at our wedding."

"And you can let Jake wear your suit first. You can buy a new one for yourself later."

Normally, if I heard those words, I'd be furious.

But at that moment, my heart was perfectly calm. Once you're utterly disappointed in someone, there's no hope left.

I replied calmly, "Okay."

She didn't expect me to agree so readily. A flicker of confusion crossed Chloe's face, but mostly, it was delight.

"Good. At least you're sensible."

With that, she left with Jake.

Anyway, in five days, I'd be leaving this place for good. I wasn't planning on getting married to her.

Forget giving him my suit, I wouldn't even mind giving him the groom's spot.
