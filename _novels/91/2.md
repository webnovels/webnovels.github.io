The kidnapper still wouldn't give up. He called two or three more times, but my oldest brother kept hanging up.

He didn't even get a chance to show Alexander the photos of me being kidnapped.

On the last call, Alexander finally exploded, yelling into the phone: "Lily, what are you playing at? I don't have time for your games!"

Then he not only hung up but also blocked my number.

The room fell into a deathly silence, and the smell of cheap tobacco slowly wafted into my nostrils.

He must have been frustrated, smoking and questioning his life choices.

After a long while, I calmly asked, "Are you going to kill me?"

He slowly said, "Huh?" Then he started trying to reassure me: "Girl, don't rush. You've got several other contacts. I'll call them one by one. Someone's bound to pay the ransom, right?"

I gave a bitter smile.

Would they?

My contacts were only my brothers, and they were probably all gathered around Rosalie right now, celebrating her birthday.

No one would care about my life or death.

Sure enough, when he called my second brother, William immediately questioned me: "Lily, it's one thing to be rebellious normally, but today is Rosalie's birthday. Can't you let her have this day? Do you have to fight for attention right now?"

"Who's Rosalie? Her or me?"

For the first time, I fought back: "Is there a possibility that today is my birthday too?"

William was silent for a long time.

In the background, I could hear the "Happy Birthday" song and the sound of people laughing and cheering.

Rosalie's voice was particularly sweet: "William! Come cut the cake!"

He seemed to snap back to reality and lowered his voice: "Lily, stop this nonsense. Come back quickly, don't ruin everyone's mood."

Then he hurriedly hung up.

At that moment, I felt utterly pointless.

If I had known it would be like this, why did they even bother bringing me back?

It would have been better if they had let me die out there, pretending I never existed.

Wouldn't that make them happier?

The kidnapper was still making calls, but I stopped him.

"Don't bother, no one will pay the ransom. Just let me go, and I'll transfer you my savings."

When I first came home, Alexander gave me a card.

He said Rosalie got $2 million in pocket money every month, so I should have the same. He'd been transferring money to me monthly.

I had never seen so much money before and didn't know how to spend it, so I just saved it all.

The card was linked to online banking, so I gave the kidnapper the password and told him to transfer it himself.

He was quite principled and immediately untied me, letting me go.

Before I left, he suddenly asked, "Girl, do you want me to take you home? Will you be okay on your own?"

I waved him off with a smile, saying, "No need, I have somewhere to go."
