Jack went out to buy me a cake, reminding me not to wander off before he left.

With nothing else to do, and not wanting to eat his cake for free, I felt my way around the room and made the bed.

When he returned, there was a hint of surprise in his voice: "You can do housework?"

"A little bit. I can manage by feeling around," I smiled and asked, "Impressive, right?"

As I smiled, I lowered my head, and the corners of my mouth slowly turned down.

Actually, I knew I wasn't just keeping busy; I was deliberately trying to please.

Over the years, I had grown accustomed to smiling at everyone. I tried to do whatever I could, humbly pleasing everyone.

Afraid of causing trouble for others, afraid of being disliked, afraid of being abandoned again...

Just like a stray dog that had been taken in, carefully observing the owner's expression every day, not daring to eat even an extra bite of food.

Thinking that this way, I could hold onto a bit of warmth.

I lowered my eyes, not saying a word.

Jack seemed to notice my low mood and pushed a piece of cut cake towards my hand.

"Girl, eat some cake. Don't think too much. Those brothers of yours are sick in the head. If I had a sister like you, I'd cherish you more than anything."

I suddenly froze. The soft cream slowly melted in my mouth, but I couldn't taste any sweetness.

Tears fell from the corners of my eyes, sliding down my cheeks and past my lips. They were salty.

At that moment, even I was shocked.

I was actually crying.

Before, I didn't cry when the traffickers beat me, I didn't cry when I couldn't beg for money and had nothing to eat, and I didn't even cry when my brothers abandoned me.

But now I was crying because of a kind word from a stranger.

I really was useless.

I bit my lip, trying to hold back, but the tears were like a broken dam, unstoppable.

"Hey, girl, why are you crying?"

A rough hand brushed across my cheek, and I instinctively flinched, saying, "Don't hit me."

The hand froze instantly, then moved away.

I wiped my tears and explained with a smile, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. I just remembered some bad things."

Perhaps because I had cried, the atmosphere became particularly heavy.

For some reason, I suddenly asked, "Brother, if I pay you, can you be my brother for a day? Just one day."

Before Jack could respond, my phone rang.

I fumbled to answer it, and my third brother Christopher's cold voice came through: "Lily! Where the hell are you? Do you know Rosalie has been waiting for you all day? Why do you always have to cause trouble for us?"

"I'm not coming back," I took a deep breath, trying to keep my voice calm. "I won't bother you anymore from now on."

"You think you're all grown up now, huh? If it weren't for Dad's dying wish, do you think anyone would want to take care of you? I'll give you one hour. If you're not back by then, I'll tell Alexander to cut off your allowance!"

I wanted to argue back, but I couldn't help but burst into tears.

Just as I didn't know how to respond, someone took the phone from me.

Jack's angry voice came from beside me: "Didn't you hear her say she's not coming back? What's with all the questions? Go to hell!"

Hearing a man's voice, Christopher was stunned for a moment, then his tone became somewhat anxious: "Who are you? Why are you with my sister? What have you done to her?"

Jack's tone was hostile: "Who I am is none of your business! And she's not your sister anymore. Don't call again! Get lost!"

The call ended, and the person beside me sighed, handing me a pack of tissues.

"You don't even know how to argue, just crying. It's okay, I told him off for you."

Something ruffled the top of my head, very gently, like petting a cat.

"Girl, from now on, I'm your brother."
