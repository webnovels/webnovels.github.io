It was late June, and the world was baking under a scorching 100-degree Fahrenheit heatwave.

My family was chilling in the living room, blasting the AC and munching on ice-cold watermelon. Me? I’d locked myself in my bedroom and cranked the heater to max.

“Electricity isn’t free, you know? Turn that off!” my dad, Robert, bellowed.

My brother, Kevin, sneered, “Too much studying has fried your brain! Hope you roast, you psycho!”

“Open this door, or you’re sleeping in the hallway!” my mom, Sharon, threatened.

I didn’t react. In fact, a faint smile played on my lips.

Because they had no idea.

Tonight, the global temperature would plunge by a hundred degrees.

The extreme cold apocalypse was coming.
