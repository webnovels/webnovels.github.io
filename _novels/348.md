"I was terminally ill with cancer. The only chemotherapy treatment that could save my life was snatched away by Tiffany Hall, who bought it for Harper Sweet, who was in the early stages of cancer.

I gave up on the life-saving treatment the doctor recommended and swallowed a powerful painkiller. The price? My organs would fail in three days, and I would die.

I gave up everything during those three days.

When I gave all my hard-earned money to Harper, my parents smiled with relief.

When I signed the divorce papers that Trent Hall offered me, he sighed and said I was so understanding.

When I pushed Lily to call Harper ""Mommy,"" she happily said that Mommy was the best.

They didn't suspect anything, even when I gave Harper my house and savings.

They just looked at me with relief and said, ""Our sensible Riley is finally back.""

But I was curious, would they think of me after I died?"
