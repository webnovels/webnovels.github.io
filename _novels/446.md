My girlfriend returned from a month-long business trip with her old flame, only to find that I had changed.

She helped her old flame steal my project, but instead of quitting in anger, I busied myself helping him write proposals.

For the sake of her old flame's year-end bonus, she ruined the design I had worked so hard on. But rather than trying to prove myself, I took all the blame and accepted her punishment.

Even when she wanted to promote her old flame to general manager, breaking company rules, I didn't get angry. Instead, I voluntarily gave up all my shares for my girlfriend to distribute freely.

My girlfriend was puzzled by my sudden obedience.

Her old flame was smug.

"See? I told you the cold treatment would work. Make him lose you once, and he'll become docile."

My girlfriend had a moment of realization and smiled, saying I was being good and that she would promote me. She even unexpectedly suggested I propose to her.

But she seemed to have forgotten that during our cold war, she had already signed my resignation letter.

And I had already broken up with her.

From now on, we would have a clean break, with no more entanglements.
