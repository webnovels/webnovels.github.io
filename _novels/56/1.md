"Asher! I've told you, no funeral for your sister. If people find out I have such a sickly sister-in-law, where would that leave my reputation?"

"Get back here immediately! Caspian's legs are sore. Aren't you a top-tier rehabilitation therapist? Hurry back and give him a massage." As soon as I hung up, Amanda's furious voice echoed for everyone to hear.

Caspian, as she mentioned, is her new boyfriend, who bears a striking resemblance to her childhood friend.

I glanced down at the urn in my arms and said, "I didn't..." hold a funeral for my sister; it was a direct burial. Before I could finish, she hung up.

Just then, Mrs. Mason arrived hastily after hearing the news.

Mrs. Mason frowned at the surroundings and turned to the butler, "Why isn't Amanda here? Doesn't she know today is her sister-in-law's burial?"

The butler, wiping his forehead, replied softly, "Madam, I can’t reach the young master..."

Mrs. Mason called Amanda several times before she answered.

"Amanda! You've been causing enough trouble daily, but do you even know what today is..." Mrs. Mason was impatiently interrupted.

"Mom, is Asher spinning tales for you again? Ignore him; he's nothing but a lying fraud."

"You..."

All Mrs. Mason was left with was a busy tone.

Mrs. Mason looked at me apologetically: "Asher, I'm sorry. Amanda is spoiled by me."

I shook my head. She wouldn’t even arrange my sister’s funeral, so why would she come to the cemetery for the burial?

I’ve long been used to it.

For seven years, Amanda detested me, believing I ruined the grand wedding she planned for her childhood friend. She treated me coldly, allowed the staff to bully me, and looked down on my background.

Later, for Declan, she aborted our barely two-month-old child and sent me the video to boast.

I still remember the icy look in her eyes that day: "Asher, you're not fit to be my child's father!"

She even pointed at my sister with hatred: "Asher, you and your sister are the disgrace of my life!"

Thinking of this, I looked at my sister’s smiling photo on the tombstone and silently said, "Mom, the seven-year promise is up."

Mom, upon hearing this, looked flustered for a moment.

I agreed to marry into the Mason Family to repay them for the medical expenses they covered for my sister, setting a seven-year term with Mrs. Mason.

Now, my sister is gone, and the term is up. It's time for me to go.

Mrs. Mason dismissed the butler and others, her voice hoarse: "Asher, I know you don't want to stay with the Mason Family. I can let you go, but..."

Her expression changed, turning stern: "You must always keep the wedding secret and never mention a word to Amanda until the day you die!"

With that, she handed me a black card: "Consider it a token of my appreciation. The money inside is enough to secure your life after this. Take it."

It wasn't appreciation; it was hush money.

If I didn’t take it, Mrs. Mason probably wouldn’t let me leave easily.

Seeing me accept the black card, her tense expression relaxed a bit, and she said quietly: "There are still seven days until the end of the seven-year term. Leave after seven days. The Mason Family also needs a legitimate reason for the announcement."

I nodded. The purpose of marrying me into the family was for the Mason Family's reputation and Amanda's public image. Waiting seven more days was nothing to me.

Mrs. Mason took the flowers from the butler and placed them in front of the tombstone, regretfully saying: "We've received news from abroad that they've found medicine to treat your sister. We just needed a few more days..."

She sighed deeply: "I should never have softened and agreed to let her leave the hospital. If only..."

My sister's condition originally didn't allow her to be discharged, but her health suddenly improved, and she insisted on leaving the hospital, not wanting to stay there. That's why I agreed for her to come home to recuperate.

I placed my sister's favorite toy in front of the tombstone and said softly: "Perhaps this way, she won't suffer from illness anymore."

For her, it was a form of release.

After offering some comfort, Mrs. Mason left with the butler.

But soon after, a few familiar-faced bodyguards barged into the cemetery, raising hammers to destroy my sister's tombstone.

I stepped forward to stop them: "What are you doing!"

The lead bodyguard signaled to stop, speaking coldly: "Son-in-law, please don't make it difficult for us. These are the lady's orders. She also asked us to deliver a message."

I clutched the hammer tightly and asked: "What message?"

The bodyguard hesitated: "This is the consequence of being late. From now on, for every second you're late, you'll kneel in the ancestral hall for another minute."
