"The things have already been loaded into the car for you, if you leave later, you'll hit traffic."  

Mrs. Taylor came back to remind me.  

Outside the window, the sun was half-set, the light dim.  

I snapped out of it, hastily put on a jacket, and got in the car.  

Because I suddenly realized, this was ten years ago, everything was still possible.  

The driver merged into traffic, "The road to the hospital is already blocked, should you call Mr. Beckett and let him wait..."  

"Not going to the hospital." I watched the ever-changing traffic lights outside the window, changed my mind, "To the company."  

...  

Actually, I don't have much impression of Jasper's company.  

When I was young, I hated him, never visited once.  

Later, when I loved him, he was targeted by enemies, surrounded by danger, I didn't dare to find him.  

So now, standing at the foot of the towering office buildings, I felt a bit lost.  

Which one was his office building?  

Passersby curiously glanced at me: holding a huge bouquet, dressed exquisitely, with makeup on, like a girl ready to confess.  

Uncomfortably, I pulled out my phone, brought up Jasper's number.  

His full name, not even an emergency contact.  

I pressed the call button, thinking I would have to wait long.  

But after two short rings, it was picked up.  

A cool, distant voice came from the receiver, "What's up?"  

Hearing his voice again, my eyes suddenly felt hot, my voice choked involuntarily.  

"Jasper, where's your office? I can't find it..."  

Passersby looked at me even more strangely.  

A woman who couldn't find her husband's office, standing on the curb, wailing.  

Jasper seemed to be in a meeting, he paused slightly, said, "Let's stop here for today."  

Then he said to me, "Stand on the sidewalk, I'll come down."  

A few minutes later, Jasper walked out of the office building.  

His tall figure cut through the neon lights, impeccably dressed, dignified.  

In contrast, the reflection in the mirror showed my eyeliner running down with tears, like the protagonist in a horror movie.  

Damn, all ruined.  

"Why are you here?"  

His tone was very light, almost cold.  

I turned back.  

The tall, handsome man was looking at me coldly, his pupils reflecting my messy face, his expression slightly stiff.  

No matter when, Jasper was always impeccable.  

Like a flower blooming on a cliff, pure and untainted.  

"I'm sorry," I lowered my head, not daring to look at him, "I disturbed you..."  

"Today..." he only said two words, didn't continue.  

I knew what he wanted to say.  

Today I should be spending Beckett's birthday with him, not appearing here.  

This did remind me.  

I shoved the flowers into his arms, mumbled, "Happy Birthday."  

A long silence.  

I sneaked a glance at him, found him staring at the bouquet, not looking happy.  

After a long time, he curled a bitter smile, "Lydia, is it what he didn't want?"  

"What?"  

I realized his mood was off, my gaze suddenly fell on the bouquet, my heart sank.  

Oh no!  

Frozen blue roses.  

The floral message is: giving you the stars and the sea.  

Beckett's favorite, also the stars and the sea.  

When I woke up, my memory was too chaotic, I was just focused on finding Jasper, neglecting these details.  

"I'm sorry, I—"  

"Thank you for the birthday gift." Jasper's tone was almost stiff, "It's late, let the driver take you home."  

He turned and walked away.  

I quickly grabbed his coat hem, "Wait!"  

Jasper didn't expect me to do this, didn't stop his steps, pulling me to stumble, crashing hard into his back.  

The back of his tailored suit bloomed into colorful flowers.  

Jasper turned back, stared at my fingers, silent for a long time.  

I was stubborn, said, "Jasper, I'm not going back."  

He looked serene, "Lydia, how do you plan to hurt me this time?"
