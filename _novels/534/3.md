I climbed into the director's office.

He was shamelessly making out with a nurse in the dark.

I turned on the lights and stared at them expressionlessly.

The

The nurse let out a scream. The director frantically covered himself with a blanket.

"Y-y-you...are you crazy?" he stammered.

I looked at him puzzled. "If I wasn't crazy, why would I be in a mental hospital?"

I sat down in the leather chair in the center of the office and propped my feet up on the desk.

"Get me a new identity."

The director flew into a rage. "What do you think you're doing?! Giving me orders! You want to rebel?!"

I reached out and opened the venetian blinds. Outside was a camcorder, its red recording it recorded.

It was a gift Ethan had bought me with his first month's salary as a cop. High definition even in the dark.

I had left it outside when I climbed in through the window.

"The movies they show in the activity room have been so boring lately," I said, waving the camcorder. "Should I give everyone this to watch instead?"

The fat on the director's face trembled. "What...what kind of identity do you want?"

I thought for a moment, then turned to the nurse. "What was your name again?"

There were dozens of nurses here, but I remembered hers as the prettiest.

The nurse stammered, "R-Rachel."

"Nice name," I said. "I'll take it."
