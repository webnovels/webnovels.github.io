"Rachel, with six years of nursing experience at Southside Psychiatric Center."

With this identity, I stood before Lucas.

Thanks to that insanity plea, he had escaped criminal charges.

The price was that he needed to stay at a psychiatric facility for a few months to lay low.

The moment he saw me, Lucas smiled.

"What a pretty new toy. I like it."

Before me, Lucas had already driven away over a dozen caretakers.

One of them was found covered in blood and is still in the ICU.

So even with sky-high pay, no one dared to come take care of this violent maniac anymore.

But I was different.

"I'm not here to be your toy," I said softly.

Before I finished speaking, a glass cup flew straight at my head.

It shattered, blood immediately flowing downehead.

Lucas lounged on the bed, smiling at me.

He was waiting for my reaction.

The previous caretakers had either screamed, broken down, or gotten angry.

But I did none of those things.

I just stuck out my tongue and licked the blood that had dripped to my lips.

Lucas stopped smiling.

His world had always been full of sheep.

But now, one wolf had finally encountered another wolf in the wilderness.

It must be quite a novel experience for him.

I walked towards Lucas step by step, sat down, and stared intently into his eyes.

"Do you enjoy seeing others in pain?" I asked softly.

This was the psychological mechanism of sadists.

Seeing others suffer gave them intense pleasure.

"Too bad, I can't feel pain. Torturing me won't do any good."

"You can't feel pain?" Lucas asked in a low voice.

"Don't believe me?"

I picked up a glass ashtray and placed it in Lucas's hand. "If you don't believe it."

Glass items weren't allowed in psychiatric facilities.

But Lucas, the only son of Starlight Group's chairman, was naturally above all rules.

He held the ashtray in his hand, staring into my eyes, not moving.

My gaze was too calm, like a still water surface with no ripples.

A person can't get any sense of accomplishment from repeatedly striking a calm water surface.

This made him lose interest.

But that's okay, I can help you find some fun.

Looking into Lucas's eyes, I spoke softly: "Although I can't feel pain, if you want to see suffering, I still have a way to help you achieve that."

I have very abnormal eyes.

Normal people would be scared of them.

But lunatics are drawn to them.
