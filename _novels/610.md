Chapter 1
Evan Carter's mistress, Chloe Carrington, had been in a car accident and urgently needed a liver transplant. The only compatible donor turned out to be Lila Monroe's mother, Margaret Rhodes.

On the day of the surgery, Evan had Margaret strapped to the operating table. Lila dropped to her knees, sobbing so hard. She begged him to stop, banging her forehead on the floor until it split open. Instead of showing her mercy, he had her locked in a detention room.

Three days passed, and the surgery was a success.

Evan stood before her, dressed sharply in a suit. He looked at Margaret like she was a stranger. "The surgery went well. I've arranged care for Margaret," he said, voice devoid of emotion. "I'm staying at the hospital with Chloe. I won't be coming home."

Lila stared at Evan, the man who once would've walked through fire for her. Her tears had long since dried. 

Just as he turned to leave, she couldn't help but rasp out, "Evan, you used to love me so much. When did that stop?"

He paused. Without looking back, he said, "We were just a political match. When did I ever love you?"

As the door clicked shut behind him, Lila slid down the wall and collapsed to the floor. The tears she thought had run dry came flooding back.

He never loved her? That couldn't be true.

Because in her previous life, Evan had loved her to death.

That was right—Lila had come back to life, in more ways than one.

In her previous life, the Monroe and Carter families had formed an alliance through marriage. She had married Evan.

Evan had adored her obsessively. She could've asked for the stars, and he still wouldn't settle for the moon. He would give her anything she wanted.

If she as much as mentioned a piece of million-dollar jewelry in passing, it'd be sitting on her vanity the next day.

If she had gotten sick, he'd be by her bedside all night without a moment's sleep.

But none of it had mattered.

She had hated him because the one she had truly wanted was her childhood friend, Damian West.

Forced into the marriage by her parents, she had fought it every step of the way. She had refused to share a bed with Evan, refused to attend social events with him. She had even gone to bars and flirted with different men just to humiliate him.

In the end, she had believed Damina's lies and run off with him.

What she hadn't realized was that Damian had never loved her. His family had a long-standing grudge against the Carters, and when he had seen how Evan felt for her, he had used her as leverage.

He had kidnapped her and threatened Evan, "Send me one of your fingers every day, or I'll kill her."

Evan hadn't said a word. He'd just started sending fingers.

On the tenth day, the last blood-soaked finger arrived—still wearing his wedding ring. 

Lila had broken down. She couldn't bear to let him keep sacrificing himself. So she had bitten through her tongue and ended her own life.

After death, her spirit had hovered above, watching the always-composed Evan descend into madness. He had come for vengeance, broken every one of Damian's bones with his bare hands. As Damian screamed in agony, Evan's eyes had gone blank.

Then he'd given up everything—his fortune, his company, Carter Corporation–and walked into a fire with her corpse in his arms.

As the flames consumed them, he had kissed her lips gently and whispered, "Lila, if there's a next life, will you love me, just once?"

Floating above, Lila had sobbed so hard her soul ached.

In that moment, she had finally seen the depth of his love.

Then she opened her eyes again.

She was back—returned to the first year of their marriage.

She cried tears of joy. This time, she vowed she'd love Evan properly.

She deleted all of Damian's contact information. She made breakfast for Evan every morning and waited up for him late into the night. Her world revolved around him.

But Evan had changed.

He no longer treated her gently, and he didn't come home every day. The warmth was gone, replaced by distance and cold indifference.

And now, he wasn't just keeping a mistress, but he was openly protecting her.

Today, he'd even forced Margaret onto an operating table just to save Chloe's life.

After Evan left, Lila collapsed onto the cold floor. She was too numb to cry—her tears were already gone.

Fine. If he no longer loved her in this life, then she'd let go of him, completely. She'd give him exactly what he wanted and set him free.

Lila staggered to her feet, dragging her exhausted body as she made her way to her mother's hospital room.

When she opened the door, Margaret was still asleep. Her face was ghostly pale beneath an oxygen mask, chest rising and falling in a weak rhythm. 

Lila stood at the bedside, staring at the frail body wrapped in a hospital gown. Her throat tightened with grief.

"Lila."

She turned sharply. Her father, Richard Monroe, stood in the doorway. He had clearly rushed back from abroad. His suit was wrinkled, his tie askew.

"Dad," she croaked. Her knees gave out, and she collapsed to the floor. "I'm sorry. It's all my fault."

Richard rushed over and pulled her up. "Don't be ridiculous! The floor's freezing. Why are you kneeling?"

His calloused hand trembled slightly as it gripped hers. "This isn't your fault. None of this is."

Lila hung her head. Her tears splattered onto the floor.

Richard sighed, gently patting her back. "Evan was the one who insisted on marrying you. He said he'd been in love with you for years."

His voice was filled with confusion. "What happened? Why is he like this now?"

Exactly. Everyone knew he loved Lila. So why had he changed?

"Dad." Lila drew in a breath. "I've made up my mind. I want a divorce. Our business is slowly moving overseas anyway. Let's just leave."

Richard fell silent. His gaze moved between her and Margaret. After a long pause, he finally asked, "You really don't love him anymore?"

Her nails dug into her palm, blood seeping through her fingers, but she didn't feel a thing.

"After what he did to Mom," she said, her voice barely a whisper, "how could I still love him?"

Another silence. Then Richard sighed, heavy and final, like he'd made a decision. "Alright. Let's go."

He patted her shoulder. "Go get the paperwork done. I'll take care of things here."

Lila nodded, eyes red-rimmed, and walked out of the room.

The immigration paperwork went smoothly. When she stepped outside, the sunlight stung her eyes.

She stood at the curb, feeling like she was floating.

It was finally over.

Then a screech of tires shattered the moment.

"Look out—!"

Before she could turn, something slammed into her and sent her flying.

…

Pain shot through her body as she woke up. When her eyes fluttered open, Evan's face was hovering over hers.

He looked down at her, disgust plain in his eyes. "Lila, was that on purpose?" he asked. "Chloe got hit in a car accident, so you had to copy her too?" 

He sneered and added, "I told you this marriage is political. There are no feelings between us. No matter how hard you try to be like her, it's useless. I don't have time for your games."

Lila opened her mouth to speak, but just then, the hospital door swung open.

"Mr. Carter, here's your chowder." Ryan Bennett, his assistant, respectfully handed over a takeout container.

Evan took it and lifted the lid. His expression darkened. 

"Why is it seafood chowder?" His tone sharpened. "She's allergic to seafood. Go get something else."

The words hit Lila like a bolt of lightning—Evan knew she was allergic to seafood.

In their past life, he hadn't known until their second year of marriage, when she nearly went into anaphylactic shock.

But right now, it was only their first year.

She thought about how strange he'd been lately. The sudden distance he kept from her. The unexplained affection he showed Chloe. And that cruel line—when did I ever love you?

A wild, impossible thought shot through her mind, and Lila began to tremble.

Her voice was barely a whisper, hoarse and broken. "Evan… did you come back too?"

Chapter 2
Evan frowned. "Come back? What are you talking about?"

Lila stared straight into his eyes. "Then how do you know I'm allergic to seafood?"

"Your parents visited me recently," Evan said, his expression calm. Not a flicker in his expression. "They asked me to treat you better, so they gave me a notebook with your preferences and dietary restrictions. I flipped through it before I tossed it."

His answer was airtight, but it still sent a sharp pain through her chest.

Had she merely been overthinking it?

Just then, a nurse pushed the door open. "Mr. Carter, Ms. Carrington is awake. She's asking for you."

Without so much as a glance in Lila's direction, Evan turned and walked out.

He never came to see her once during the three days she was hospitalized. Each time the nurse came to change her dressing, the hesitant look in her eyes felt like silent mockery.

On the fourth morning, Lila discharged herself from the hospital.

The immigration process was already complete. All that was left now was one final step—divorce.

She sat at her desk and carefully wrote out the divorce papers, each stroke of the pen slicing into her like a blade. The terms were simple—she wanted nothing but her freedom.

Suddenly, her phone buzzed with a new social post from Chloe.

In the photo, Evan sat behind his desk while Chloe leaned against his shoulder, flashing a peace sign. The caption read, "Someone said non-staff weren't allowed in his office, but he made an exception for me today."

Lila's finger hovered over the screen for a long time, unmoving.

In their past life, Evan had also broken countless rules for her. He hated spicy food, but still sat through fiery meals until he ended up in the ER.

He was a clean freak, yet carried her home when she was drunk and barely standing.

He loathed the sunlight, but still showed up for a magazine interview just because she asked.

Lila took a deep breath and forced those memories out of her head. She grabbed the divorce papers and left.

The Carter Corporation building was just as grand as ever. As the elevator rose through the floors, she was still figuring out how to bring up the divorce. 

When she neared the CEO's office, Evan's assistant, Ryan, appeared with a stack of documents.

"Mrs. Carter?" Ryan looked surprised. "Are you here to see Mr. Carter?"

"Yes." Lila tightened her grip on the folder. "Just need his signature on something."

Ryan's eyes lingered on her pale face. "I'm heading in now. I can take it in for you."

After a brief hesitation, she handed him the folder. "Thanks."

He slipped it in with the documents he was carrying and knocked gently on the door.

The moment it opened, Lila's blood froze.

Evan was kneeling on one knee, gently massaging Chloe's feet. She was lounging on the couch in a short skirt, her pale legs resting on his thigh. There was a sweet smile on her face.

"Mr. Carter, these documents need your signature." 

Ryan's voice made Evan look up. Without even glancing through them, he signed off on the documents while still focused on massaging Chloe's feet.

Lila stood at the door, her nails digging deep into her palm.

In her past life, she'd twisted her ankle playing tennis, and Evan had knelt just like this, carefully applying ointment to her foot. His brow had been furrowed with worry, afraid of even pressing too hard.

Soon, Ryan returned and handed her the signed document. "Here you go, Mrs. Carter."

Lila stared at the bold signature sprawled across the page, her eyes turning red. She nodded, murmured a thanks, and walked away.

While waiting for the elevator, she called her lawyer, Alex Sterling.

"We've both signed. How long until the divorce is finalized?" she asked.

"Mrs. Carter, after the one-month cooling-off period, it'll be official."

She nodded and had just ended the call when a voice rang out behind her.

"Lila? What are you doing here?"

She turned sharply to see Evan letting go of Chloe's hand, striding toward her with a dark expression.

"Who told you to come here?" he asked, grabbing her wrist. "How many times do I have to tell you? This is just a political marriage. I don't interfere with you, so stay out of my life."

Lila yanked her arm free. "Got it. It won't happen again."

The tension crackled between them. Chloe quickly stepped in and took Evan's arm. "Evan, don't be like that. She's still your wife," she said sweetly. 

Then she turned to Lila. "Actually, it's good you're here. Evan and I are going to an auction. You should come. Your mom saved me, and I haven't had the chance to thank her."

"No need." Lila rejected her offer. "My mom doesn't need anything."

Chloe's eyes instantly reddened. "But if you don't come, I'll feel terrible…"

"Lila." Evan's voice turned cold. "If I told you to go, then go. Don't be ungrateful."

His gaze was icy, so different from the soft, loving way he used to look at her.

Lila suddenly felt exhausted. She was too tired to argue.

Chapter 3
In the end, Lila was forced to attend the auction.

She sat among the crowd, surrounded by the rising calls of bids. Evan raised his paddle with elegance and ease, each bid drawing gasps of admiration.

"50 million dollars! Mr. Carter has bid 50 million dollars!" the auctioneer shouted excitedly. "The sapphire necklace goes to Mr. Carter!"

Chloe leaned against Evan's shoulder, smiling like a victor. "Evan, the necklace is so beautiful."

"As long as you like it," he said, gently tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ears.

"Mr. Carter really spoils his mistress," someone whispered from the back row.

"That's nothing," another voice replied. "Last month, Ms. Carrington mentioned she liked that island in Blue Dominion—worth over a hundred million dollars—and Mr. Carter transferred the deed to her the very next day."

Lila clenched her paddle, her knuckles turning white.

In her past life, Evan had spoiled her the same way. But now, all that tenderness belonged to someone else.

"Lila," Chloe said, suddenly leaning over, "which one do you like? I'll have Evan bid on it for you."

Lila shook her head coldly. "No need."

"Then wait for the next one," Chloe urged. "Maybe it'll be something you like."

The auctioneer tapped his gavel. "The next item is rather unique. Please enjoy the presentation."

As the screen lit up, the room erupted into chaos.

Photos of Chloe completely naked showed up on screen. She was posing in obscene and degrading positions. The high resolution and full-body close-ups revealed every detail.

"Damn, her skin's really fair."

"That pose is filthy."

"Wonder how much she charges for a night."

Vulgar whispers filled the air. Chloe's face turned from red to white, then to ashen gray.

"Turn it off! Turn it off now!" she screamed, trembling. "That's not me! It's not!"

She spun toward Lila, tears streaming down her face. "Lila! Do you hate me that much? You had to humiliate me like this? Are you trying to drive me to suicide?"

Covering her face, she ran out sobbing.

Evan's expression darkened dangerously. "I'll buy every single one of those photos. Remove them in three seconds. If you're late by even one, I'll shut your auction house down."

His sharp gaze swept across the room. "If anyone dares to leak a word of what happened tonight, be prepared to face the consequences."

Then he turned to Lila. His voice was like ice. "Just wait."

Lila returned to the villa in a daze, cold all over. Her mind was blank.

She had no idea how those photos ended up at the auction. Yes, she disliked Chloe. Yes, she was prideful. But she would never stoop this low. She didn't even have those pictures.

But Evan would never believe that. To him, it would only sound like excuses.

She sat on the couch, waiting in fear the entire night.

As dawn approached, the front door slammed open with a violent kick.

Evan stormed in, fury radiating from him. His eyes were bloodshot. "Lila!"

He grabbed her by the chin, his grip so tight it felt like he might break her jaw.

"Do you know that Chloe jumped into the sea?" he growled, his voice raw with anger. "If I hadn't gotten there in time, she'd be a corpse right now!"

"It wasn't me," Lila managed to choke out. "I didn't release those photos."

"Not you?" He sneered and let go with a harsh shove. "What, are you saying she posted them herself?"

Lila had no words.

Just as she opened her mouth, Evan cut her off coldly. "This marriage is just an alliance. We're nothing to each other. But you've hurt the person I love again and again. You're going to pay."

The words stabbed her like a knife.

In their past life, when people had hurt her, Evan had stood in front of her and said, "Anyone who touches Lila will die with their whole family."

But now, he said that for someone else.

"Lila, go to the hospital and apologize to Chloe now!"

Tears welled up in her eyes, but she stubbornly stared back. "I did nothing wrong. I don't even know what I'm supposed to apologize for."

Evan let out a cold laugh and snapped his fingers. Two bodyguards entered immediately and pinned her down.

"Take her to the shock room," he said without looking back. "She can come down when she realizes what she's done."

The shock room? 

Lila stared at Evan in disbelief. He was really going to shock her just to make her apologize to Chloe.

Before she could even react, she was dragged into a cold basement and strapped to an electric bed. Her arms and legs were tightly secured, the leather straps biting into her skin.

The guard flipped the switch.

"Ahh—!"

Electricity tore through her body. She arched violently, only to be yanked back down by the restraints. Her teeth cut into her lip. The taste of blood filled her mouth.

"Ready to apologize?" the guard asked, pressing the button to increase the voltage.

It felt like thousands of needles were stabbing through her veins, from her fingertips straight into her heart. A low, inhuman whimper escaped her throat. Her teeth tore her lower lip into a bloody mess.

She shook her head. Her hair clung to her sweaty face.

She had done nothing wrong. Why should she apologize?

The shock hit again, stronger this time.

Her vision blurred. Her muscles convulsed out of control.

"Ah—!" 

A third time.

A fourth.

A fifth.

The tenth.

"Stop… please stop." She finally broke. Her voice cracked into sobs, tears mixed with blood streaming down her face. "I was wrong… I'll apologize… I'll go apologize—I'll apologize!"
