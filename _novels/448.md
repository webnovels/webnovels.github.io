Two months after my facial reconstruction surgery following a car accident, my husband Jack Young got together with my well-mannered sister Emily. When our parents found out, not only did they not blame them, but they actually persuaded me to step aside voluntarily.

Even my own daughter showed nothing but disgust towards me.

"I don't want this ugly freak as my mom. I want Aunt Emily to be my mom," Lily said coldly.

I calmly agreed and chose to leave the Young family, cutting ties with them completely.

After years of hard work and struggle, I finally achieved financial freedom.

Later, I adopted two children from an orphanage. Under my careful nurturing, they became a rising star in the tech industry and a business tycoon worth billions respectively.

Watching them succeed, I decided to go crazy once and take an aimless budget trip around the world.

Halfway through my journey, Jack Young and our daughter found me.

Looking at my weathered appearance from sleeping rough, their faces were full of mockery.

"Looks like we were right. After leaving the Young family, you can only live like a beggar, barely scraping by," Jack sneered.

"Now our parents want to see you. We're giving you one last chance to come back with us," he continued.

"It'll also let you experience the wealthy lifestyle our family enjoys now, you beggar," Lily added with a smirk.
