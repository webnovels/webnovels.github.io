"Nancy, are you really going to divorce Ryan and go abroad for further studies?" In the quiet living room, Nancy Xu looked at Mrs. Sullivan's surprised face across from her and nodded.

"Yes, Aunt Sullivan. And as you know, I wasn't the one who was supposed to marry him in the first place. For Ryan, I was just an unexpected stand-in, a substitute when the real bride didn't show up. Now that she's back, he's been very happy lately, so it's time for me to go."

Outside, fine snow was falling gently, creating a beautiful winter scene.

Nancy smiled lightly, "Going abroad to study has always been my dream anyway."

Mrs. Sullivan looked at the young woman before her, remembering three years ago when Fiona Quinn, who was supposed to be the bride, ran away abroad on Ryan's wedding day.

Just as Ryan was standing awkwardly at the altar, red-eyed and not knowing what to do, Nancy put on an ill-fitting wedding dress and slowly walked up to the stage.

Full of apology, she picked up the microphone and apologized to all the guests: "I'm so sorry, there was traffic on the way, I'm late."

It was this act that saved Ryan's face and the Sullivan family's reputation.

Mrs. Sullivan sighed deeply and asked uncertainly, "Will Ryan agree to the divorce?"

Nancy shook her head with a smile, "I already have the divorce agreement."

After all, she had sent the divorce papers half a month ago. At that time, Ryan was in such a hurry to finish work and go see Fiona that he signed without even looking, and left.

Now, she just had to wait seven more days to get the divorce certificate, and then she would be free.

After all, the Sullivan family, for three generations, couldn't go abroad due to the confidential nature of their work.

So once she went abroad, she and Ryan would never have to see each other again.

Just as Mrs. Sullivan was about to speak, a magnetic male voice suddenly came from behind the two of them.

"Nancy, what are you chatting about with Mom?"

Nancy turned around and saw Ryan, whom she hadn't seen for days, in a black suit walking towards them.

"...Ryan."

Seeing her son approach, Mrs. Sullivan was about to step forward to scold him.

"Why are you here?"

With three parts surprise and seven parts reassurance, Nancy stood up and gave Mrs. Sullivan a pleading look, interrupting her at the right moment.

"I missed you, so I came to pick you up on the way."

Ryan's eyes were a bit guilty. Actually, he had come on purpose after learning of Nancy's whereabouts.

After saying goodbye to the worried Mrs. Sullivan, the two took their bags and left the Sullivan family mansion.

On the way back, heavy rain beat against the car windows, but inside it was completely silent.

Ryan was silent for a long time before he finally spoke.

"Nancy."

"Actually, Fiona and I are over. It's just that she just came back to the country and had heart surgery a few years ago, so her health isn't good. As an old... friend, I just went to help her settle in, so I hope you can understand."

Nancy looked out at the rain blurring her view through the window and nodded.

If only she hadn't seen how excited Ryan was when he dropped everything to run and meet Fiona the day she returned.

If only she hadn't seen Ryan sell the watch he had used for years and exchange it for a cheap bracelet Fiona had given him.

If only...

There were too many "if onlys".

Nancy no longer had any expectations or trust.

The car was quiet for a moment before Ryan spoke again:

"Nancy, what was that document you had me sign half a month ago?"

As soon as he finished speaking, Nancy turned to look at Ryan, her eyes three parts surprised and seven parts bitter smile.

He only remembered to ask now?

But then again, since Fiona came back, how could he care about anything else?

Nancy was about to speak when Ryan's phone suddenly rang.

Seeing the name displayed on the car screen, Ryan's face suddenly became tense.

"It's okay, answer it. Maybe it's something important?"

Nancy looked out the window, appearing unconcerned, which made Ryan suddenly feel afraid.

But in the end he still answered the call, with the car's speakers automatically on.

"Ryan, I miss you so much it hurts. Can we meet?"

Hearing the coquettish tone on the other end, Ryan's slender fingers gripping the steering wheel turned slightly white, and his expression suddenly turned cold.

"Fiona, I'm married now. I've told you many times, don't talk to me in that tone!"

There was silence on the other end for a moment before Fiona said, "But Ryan, I was supposed to be the bride at that wedding back then."

The car suddenly screeched to a halt in the middle of the road, the tires making a huge sound as they skidded on the ground.

In three years of marriage, this was the first time Nancy had seen Ryan lose control. He shouted at the screen:

"But you left! You left me all alone!"

The phone went silent for a moment.

A moment later, the voice on the other end became a bit choked up: "I'm sorry. My health wasn't good at the time and I didn't want to worry you. I didn't know it would have such serious consequences."

"Ah! Ryan! My heart hurts so much. It's okay, just let me die like this. Then I won't bother you anymore, and you can live happily with that substitute of mine."

Soon, there was no more sound from the other end of the phone. Ryan immediately panicked and looked at Nancy.

Nancy spoke first: "It's fine, I'll take a taxi back. You go see her, don't let anything really happen to her."

Ryan still felt somewhat guilty and said softly, "I'm not going to see her, I just remembered there's an urgent matter at the company, so I'm going there for a bit."

"I'll come back to be with you after I'm done."

Nancy nodded and opened the car door to get out.

Watching his car speed away, Nancy stood in the rain holding an umbrella, her eyes dimming slightly.

A moment later, she gave a bitter smile and started walking towards home, over ten miles away.

Three years. It was time to end it.

Three years ago, she had put on that ill-fitting wedding dress and married a man who couldn't even remember her name.

Relatives and friends privately said Nancy was pitiful, saying she was just a substitute for her husband's true love.

But in the three years since, the two of them had spent time together under the moonlight and stars, dreaming of the future.

Nancy thought she was loved.

But now, Nancy clearly knew she was wrong.

Since that was the case, she chose to let Ryan go.

It was also liberating herself.

Thunder split the night sky, followed immediately by a downpour that swept over like a tidal wave,

Also sweeping away Nancy's last bit of affection for Ryan.
