"It's me who's given you too much f**king face. You're even riding your boy toy on top of my head now!"

I couldn't be bothered to hold back anymore and snapped at her directly.

There was a moment of silence on the other end before Olivia spoke again, suppressing her anger,

"Adrian Quinn, what the hell is wrong with you? Such vulgar language, is this how you honor the 20 years of education your parents provided? Is this what you learned from all those years of study - to make unreasonable scenes?"

"I already said I'd play with you next time. What are you still making a fuss about?"

"You'd better go prepare for that professor delegation reception right now. If you mess it up, we're through!"

I clenched my fist tightly, "Fine, let's be through then. I've wanted to end things with you for a long time!"

Before I could finish speaking, I heard William calling Olivia from the background, "Olivia, mom's calling you for dinner."

Then I heard Olivia's voice become unprecedentedly gentle, "I'm just wrapping up some small matters. I'll be right there."

Her tone turned icy cold again when she spoke to me, "What did you just say? I didn't hear clearly."

I laughed coldly:

"Olivia, listen carefully. I said you've found yourself a new mom in just half a day, huh? Better hurry, or your mom might get annoyed and smack you with that rolling pin."

"Oh right... I'm just being petty and fussy."

Olivia lowered her voice and roared:

"People in the countryside always bully honest kids like William. As his mentor, what's wrong with me helping him get some payback? You can't expect everyone to be as cold-blooded and heartless as you!"

"Adrian Quinn, you come back to the office right now and coordinate with the team receiving the visiting professor delegation. Otherwise, don't blame me for ruining your reputation in the translation industry!"

She cursed a few more times before hanging up.

I stood in the stuffy, cramped communication room, listening to the dial tone with a feeling of desolation.

I had made a huge mistake. I should have divorced Olivia long ago, back when she first started treating me coldly and ignoring my feelings.

I lost all desire to play and was about to take a cab back to the hotel.

The next second, messages flooded in until my phone was vibrating non-stop. Everyone was privately messaging me to come back to the office to work.

Though it was an urgent matter where they needed my help, their tones couldn't have been more disrespectful.

The divorce certificate would be in my hands in two days. I couldn't care less about the mess at Olivia's company. I deleted that batch of fair-weather colleagues and opened the company app to submit my resignation.

But as soon as I opened it, I saw the company's announcement of my dismissal, with an attached notice criticizing my poor work performance and low moral character.

I laughed. It was my first time seeing someone burn bridges before even crossing the river. Olivia really did love her little toy boy.

I enjoyed myself for two days, then went straight to the office to pack up my things after getting off the plane.

To my surprise, when I got to my office door, neither facial recognition nor my work badge could open it.

I was confused when the door opened from inside.

"Adrian, what are you doing here? Hurry to the airport! The team receiving the delegation left a long time ago!" William walked out of my office, wearing my watch on his wrist and drinking from my mug. Now he was even ordering me around!

I shoved him aside and walked into the office. "It's not your place to give me orders."

As soon as I entered, I saw that all my belongings had been cleared out. The trash can held photos of Olivia and me, along with the voice recorder and brooch she had given me.

Yes, Olivia had loved me once. Those years when we started the business together were the most difficult but also the happiest.

William caught my moment of distraction and deliberately exclaimed, "Oh Adrian, I forgot to mention, Olivia gave me this office. Your things were probably thrown out by the cleaners."

He stared at me intently, hoping to see me explode or go crazy.

But I smiled at him and glanced casually at the trash can. "Thanks for throwing out this garbage for me. Saves me from getting my hands dirty."
