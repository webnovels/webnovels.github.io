"Adrian Quinn, why are you still here? The delegation is about to arrive!" Olivia's face was as cold as iron, her voice anxious.

I frowned and glared at her. "So what? Why should I care?" I said as I strode out.

"But Adrian, you can't..." William hurried to block my path. As we brushed shoulders, he suddenly cried out and fell heavily to the ground.

"William! Are you okay?" Olivia, who had just been glaring at me, instantly panicked. She took two big steps, shoved me aside, and anxiously helped William up, gently patting his back to comfort him when she saw he wasn't injured.

Olivia glared at me furiously. "Well, Adrian Quinn, have I given you too much face? Is this what you learned from all those years of education - bullying colleagues and picking on the weak? Apologize to William right now!"

I laughed coldly. Before I could speak, William added fuel to the fire, sounding wronged, "Olivia, don't be angry. Adrian must be too anxious about the professor delegation project. He didn't mean to push me."

Reminded of this, Olivia also grew nervous. "Are you trying to get fired? If this project gets messed up, you can resign on your own!"

I laughed strangely. "Olivia, are you pretending to have amnesia on top of finding new parents? I was fired by you yesterday. The life and death of your precious company have nothing to do with me now."

Olivia's whole body trembled with anger. She raised her hand to slap me but ended up knocking the computer off the desk. Her voice was terrifyingly low,

"Fired? Are you deliberately sabotaging such an important project just to threaten me with quitting?"

I really didn't know whether to laugh or cry. She was the one who issued the dismissal notice. This pair of cheaters was too much. I quickened my pace to leave - spending another second with them made me want to vomit.

But Olivia called out as I was leaving, "Adrian Quinn, according to company policy, for major losses caused by personal mistakes, compensation must be paid..."

I didn't even look back as I walked away. "Yeah, if you keep yapping instead of cleaning up this mess, it won't be compensation - it'll be bankruptcy!"

Thinking of Olivia's gnashing teeth, I felt secretly pleased.

She had wanted to manipulate me into cleaning up William's mess, but this time I didn't give an inch. She had kicked an iron plate.

After leaving the company, I listed the marital home I had bought years ago for sale online, priced for a quick sale.

The real estate agent said those school district apartments were in high demand. He quickly found a buyer offering much more than my asking price.

The price didn't matter. What mattered was that anything related to Olivia felt like a thorn in my side.

Then I drove straight to the civil affairs bureau and got the divorce certificate I had been longing for.

Our mutually torturous marriage was finally over!
