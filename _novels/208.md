I have been in an on-and-off relationship with Declan for seven years.

I was the one who ended things, and he always tried to get us back together.

But the last time I suggested breaking up, he didn’t try to win me back. Instead, he found someone who bore a striking resemblance to me.

To support her, he took away my opportunities.

He effortlessly passed the Oscar-winning Actress title, which I had been striving for over ten years, to her.

At the award ceremony, a reporter asked if I regretted breaking up.

I smiled, raised my hand to show off the diamond ring on my finger:

"I'm getting married."

As soon as I said that, everyone saw the usually composed and proud Heir of the Declan Family suddenly have reddened eyes.
