Just before I took my last breath, I finally agreed to sign the divorce papers.

Ten years of love couldn't withstand one taunt from his first love.

I clutched the pen and died in Jack's arms.

Jack, who had patiently asked me for divorce 100 times after our marriage,

Broke down crying uncontrollably after my death.

Later, he took my ashes and disappeared into the sea.

Just before the waves engulfed him, he said:

"Lucy, I was wrong. If there's another life, I'll make amends."

Perhaps moved by his words, when I opened my eyes again, I had returned to the fifth year after we first met.

Looking at the completely changed Jack before me,

I finally understood.

Maybe our ending was too tragic in the previous life, so in this life he just wanted to choose the path he truly desired.

But when I was lying in the hospital bed again,

He cried until his eyes were red, cursing himself over and over for being useless.
