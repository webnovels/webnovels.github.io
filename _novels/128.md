I had been dating Zachary Xavier for three years before I found out he came from a wealthy family when we got married.

But Zachary's brothers all said I was just after his money, and urged him to control my finances.

Zachary actually believed them.

After we got married, he not only wouldn't let me work, but also only gave me $100 a month for expenses.

He said it was enough.

It really was enough.

I not only went shopping every day, but could also afford luxury skincare and designer bags.

He grew suspicious and demanded to know where I was getting money from.

I put on an innocent face: "Honey, it's from the allowance you give me every month!"

He got angry: "I only give you $100 a month, what can you even do with that?"

So he did know that $100 a month wasn't enough for anything.

But it didn't matter.

He gave me $100 each month.

His good brothers each gave me $100,000 every month.
