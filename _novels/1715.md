I brought my three-month-old son and husband home for Christmas.

But my ten-year-old niece,  Claudia, and her friend threw my son from an upstairs window.

I frantically scooped him up, my mind screaming for the hospital, but it was too late. He died right there.

Because  Claudia was so young, she faced no punishment.

The judge ordered  Claudia’s family to pay eight hundred thousand, but  Claudia twisted it, claiming I was trying to ruin their lives.

I didn't want compensation; I just wanted my baby back!

I sobbed until my chest felt ripped open, demanding justice. My husband, Owen, and his mother, Mrs. Miller, just lashed out at me:

“ Claudia is just a child! Are you really going to destroy her life just because *your* son is gone?”

My quest for revenge was futile, and eventually, a heart attack claimed me that winter.

When I opened my eyes again, I was back on Christmas Day. I immediately called my parents and had them take Kalan away.

But this time,  Claudia still killed a baby!

Whose baby was it?
