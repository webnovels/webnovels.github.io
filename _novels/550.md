It was the third year with Landon when I overheard his buddy ask him:

“Landon, you had your brother pretend to be you? Dating and even kissing your little naive boyfriend? He seriously won’t figure it out?”

Landon exhaled a puff of smoke, utterly unconcerned.

“We look practically identical. Julian’s simple-minded; he won’t notice a thing.”

“Besides, my brother is totally homophobic. And he doesn’t do used goods, so he’d never actually sleep with him.”

I lowered my gaze, pretending I didn’t know.

For three years, the one I’d been dating, holding hands with, kissing – it was all Landon’s brother.

The one who gripped my waist every night, whispering for me to call him 'Husband' – that was him too.

Landon’s supposedly homophobic brother was now holding me in the bathtub, gently murmuring.

“Just let me clean you up, sweetheart. You’ll get sick.”

I turned my face away, feeling drained.

His expression remained unchanged. He could talk dirty and still look like a perfect gentleman.

Who knew his kinks ran that deep?

While I was silently fuming, a phone chimed.

I watched Jasper subtly angle his phone screen away.

I knew immediately it was Landon on the other end.

Sure enough, he kissed my forehead. “I’ll just step out for a call. If the water gets cold, let me know.”

I stood up, following him silently.

*Click.*

The sound of a lighter sparked from the balcony first.

“Bro, is he with you right now?”

“Hm.”

Jasper lowered his head, loosely gripping the cigarette between his teeth.

A moment of silence passed on the other end.

“You really don’t need to go to such lengths. Just string him along normally. Why let him stay over… I went to his dorm tonight, couldn’t find him.”

“Didn’t you tell me to pretend to be you and keep him placated?”

Jasper exhaled a thin stream of smoke, unhurried.

“What, changed your mind? You’re not chasing girls anymore, and now you want to date a guy?”

“How could I?” Landon’s voice instantly filled with disgust.

“He’s nowhere near Stella. At most, I’d just take pity on him and sleep with him a few times, that’s it.”

Laughter and jeers erupted from the phone, and Landon’s voice grew even more contemptuous.

“A real relationship? He’s not worthy.”

I stood behind the door, listening silently, my throat tightening.

“Landon, are you really okay with just tossing him to your brother like that? Julian is way prettier than a lot of the girls at school.”

They were probably at a bar; Landon’s voice slurred with drunkenness.

“No matter how pretty, he’s still just a guy. Can’t even get pregnant.”

“Damn, you’re getting me all worked up!”

“—Last time Julian kissed you, his lips were so red. Jasper, tell him, wasn’t that just so damn tempting?”

“Knock it off! You know my brother’s homophobic. Kissing a guy is his limit. Right, bro?”

Jasper slowly toyed with the lighter in his hand, not answering.

The air suddenly went still.

“Bro?”

In the almost eerie silence, Landon’s voice grew noticeably tense.

I quietly peeked at the man standing in the night.

After our intimate moments, Jasper still looked perfectly put-together, not a hair out of place.

He leaned against the railing, slowly exhaling smoke.

After a long moment, he finally stubbed out the cigarette, speaking faintly.

“Mm.”
