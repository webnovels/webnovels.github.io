I was the last holdout. For three years, I'd turned down every developer's offer to buy my house.

Today, during yet another negotiation, a barrage of transparent comments suddenly flickered across my vision:

"Holy shit! Her husband's banging his first love in the basement RIGHT NOW!!"

"Layla Thompson is so clueless. Any payout will just fund his mistress!"

"Forget the money. She'll end up BURIED down there if she's not careful!"

I am Layla, and I was so enraged, my hands trembled.

I snatched the pen from the table, signed the demolition agreement. Then I added a single condition.

"Demolition to commence immediately. Flatten it. Now."


Mr. Davies, the developer's lead negotiator, stared at the signed agreement in his trembling hands.

"Ms. Thompson, are you sure? This contract is final and effective the moment you sign."

His voice was excited, almost euphoric.

He had every reason to be thrilled. For three long years, I'd been the reason for his migraines and, quite possibly, the premature gray in his hair.

I was the last holdout in the entire village.

And my house sat right in the center of it all.

The developers couldn't get around it, couldn't avoid it.

If pleading would help, he would have groveled at my feet.

But at that moment, I was still reeling from the bullet comments.

My husband and his first love, having a passionate encounter in the basement?

I couldn't confirm if it was true yet.

My husband, Mark Allen, was supposedly on a business trip, far away.

For so many years, I'd doted on him, treating him like he was made of glass.

When I married him, he was a nobody. I was the one who funded his company.

Now that he'd made it big, he dared to cheat on me right under my nose?

How could I possibly stand for that?

After three years of haggling, I'd finally negotiated the compensation up to a very satisfying 18 million.

I was ready to sign.

It was Mark who stubbornly held out for 25 million, delaying everything.

Fine. If he wants to play it that way, let's just demolish the house first.

Money was never the point for me anyway. I came from wealth.
