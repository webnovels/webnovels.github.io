The moment I agreed to take Rhys Easton back, his so-called 'sister-figure' was right back on his lap.

Her arm draped around his neck, she shot me a condescending smirk. “Chill out, Avery. Don’t get all psycho-jealous again. It’s no big deal. You know I don’t even like this jerk.”

I simply offered a thin smile and said, “It’s fine.”

From the second we reunited, I had committed to becoming Rhys Easton’s idea of the perfect girlfriend.

No more raging fits of jealousy over his casual banter with his female 'bro.' No more secretly installing GPS trackers on his phone to monitor his every move.

Now, even if he and his sister-figure shared a joke-kiss, slept in the same bed, or—as they had last night—had a drunken hookup, I could deliver the morning-after pill without a flicker of emotion.

“I get it,” I said calmly, placing the water bottle and foil packet on his nightstand. “It was an accident. You were just drunk. I’m not mad.”

It wasn't because my love for Rhys Easton was that deep.

It was because the System had promised me that anything I gained from him—any physical asset—I could take back with me to my original world.

I wasn’t going to waste three years of my life with him for nothing.

“Why aren’t you angry?”

Rhys looked at me, his brow tightly furrowed.

I already knew what I would find behind the door when an anonymous text led me here.

I used to be angry. I used to be an inferno of rage.

From the start, Rhys had indulged his childhood friend, Dakota Riley. He called her his best friend, his ride-or-die. But when he started eating off her fork, I’d flipped the table. When they lost a game of Truth or Dare and kissed, I’d slapped Dakota so hard her face swelled up, and then I put a tracker on Rhys’s phone.

His friends hated me. Rhys called me crazy, hysterical. Dakota, crying, swore she’d cut him out of her life.

The breaking point was when Dakota fell critically ill with a 104-degree fever. After she was rushed to the ER and stabilized, she looked at Rhys, weak but furious.

“Why did you even bother, you asshole? Your psycho-girlfriend is just going to show up and beat me senseless again. She’ll finish the job for the fever, you idiot!”

The fear of losing Dakota was what finally made Rhys snap.

He dumped me.

I had only come to this world for him. Once the initial mission failed, the System went silent. I was stranded. No documentation, no degree, no way to get home. I went from the pampered girlfriend of the City’s richest heir to scrubbing floors and waiting tables. The fall from grace was devastating.

Rhys and Dakota had even come to look down on me once.

“When you finally learn some grace and forgiveness, when you can actually tolerate Dakota, maybe I’ll consider taking you back.”

Then, the System reappeared.

I swore I would never endure that kind of humiliation and pain again.

I smiled, my voice slow and steady. “Because...” (Because I don’t love you.) “Because this was an accident. It wasn't your true intention.”

I had finally mastered the "tolerance and grace" he demanded.

Rhys watched me in silence for a few seconds, then let out a visible sigh of relief.

On the bed, Dakota, covered in hickey marks, impatiently threw a pillow at Rhys.

“Rhys Easton, your technique is awful. You hurt me, and then you wouldn’t stop when I asked. Annoying.” She waved him away. “Now get out. Stop with the nauseating couple act. Trying to make me feel bad for being single, asshole?”

On the drive back, Rhys kept glancing at me. Once I was buckled in, he spoke, his voice low.

“Avery, you’ve changed. A lot.”

I was scrolling through my phone, comparing prices on bespoke high-end jewelry, and didn't look up.

“I love you, of course I’m going to change for you,” I cooed, flashing the phone screen at him. “It’s my birthday, remember? I want this necklace. Can you get it for me?”

I had chosen the most expensive piece with the highest collector's value.

Rhys was the sole heir to an immense fortune. He was never stingy, but he was completely devoid of romance. He usually only bought me ridiculously priced things after I had a jealous fit about him and Dakota.

It was guilt money. Pure and simple.

Rhys hadn't answered when Dakota suddenly called.

“Get your ass back here now! That… stuff you left on me leaked all over the floor and I slipped and can’t get up.”

Dakota’s voice was loud, even though he wasn’t on speaker. She seemed to want me to hear. “Are you trying to murder me so your girlfriend can take my place? Hurry up, or I’m cutting you out of my life, you ungrateful jerk!”

This was the same old routine. In the past, no matter how much I’d begged or pleaded, Rhys would have left, probably accusing me of being dramatic and manipulative.

But now, I smiled sweetly at him.

“Go ahead. I can grab an Uber or the subway home.”

He froze, his thin lips pressed into a line. Then, astonishingly, he spoke into the phone.

“Can’t you handle it yourself? I’m going home with Avery. It’s her birthday.”

I was genuinely taken aback, but I immediately suppressed the flicker of warmth I felt. Don't be a fool. Don't be sentimental.

I didn’t hear what Dakota said next, but Rhys eventually pulled the car over and asked me to get out. He looked genuinely guilty.

“I’ll get you the necklace, I promise. I just need to check on her first. I’ll come back tonight, and we’ll celebrate.”

But by the time evening rolled around, Rhys was—as usual—missing in action.

The promised necklace? It was already on Dakota’s neck, judging by the triumphant posts on her social media account. I wasn't upset. Every single item Rhys promised me, I could take with me when I left.

“Host, are you sure you want to leave this world? The male lead’s love index is at ninety percent, you know. His family is so rich. If you stay and marry him, you’ll escape your old, miserable life.”

I shrugged internally. “That’s still a ten percent failure rate, and I’m not interested in eating lukewarm leftovers. Who cares about the scraps?”

He’d been at one-hundred percent love before, but he’d still dropped ten points for Dakota. He could lose it all again just as easily. Love, in the end, was too brittle. Money was hard, cold, and solid.

At ten p.m., Rhys finally called, saying Dakota had thrown me a surprise birthday party.

When I arrived, they were playing Truth or Dare.

Dakota was holding up a deck of cards, a look of gleeful malice on her face. “Whoever pulls an Ace gets the grand prize: ten seconds of kissing me! Don’t be shy, boys. A kiss from me is worth more than gold.”

Rhys turned his card. It was the Ace of Spades. The sudden silence in the room was deafening.

Everyone immediately looked at me.

I walked over to Rhys, sat down calmly beside him, and pulled out my phone.

“Go for it,” I said cheerfully. “I’ll record it. It’ll be a great memory for you two to look back on when you’re old.”

No screaming. No table-flipping. No cursing. My expression was perfectly serene.

Rhys’s face darkened.

The next second, Dakota hooked her arms around his neck. “Avery gave the green light, so what, are you a coward now? You were manhandling me all night last night, and now you can’t kiss your sister-figure? Is that what I taught you?” She shoved him away in fake annoyance. “Whatever. If you’re not willing, I’ll find someone else to sub in.”

She reached for the guy next to her, but Rhys yanked her back, hard.

They started kissing. It was a vicious, competitive exchange, lasting far longer than the ten seconds.

Seeing that I wasn’t reacting, the surrounding crowd started cheering, elbowing me in the arm.

“Attagirl, Avery. You’re finally being chill about this. You’re smart. Since you’re so understanding, we’ll start inviting you out with the guys.”

I was finally accepted by Rhys’s inner circle.

How wonderfully ironic, just when I stopped caring about him entirely.

Rhys wasn’t kissing with any real passion. Every few seconds, his eyes darted to me. I wasn’t sure what he wanted, so I just gave him a thumbs-up, signaling that he was doing a great job.

Rhys’s face turned glacial. He abruptly shoved Dakota away, grabbed my hand, and dragged me out into the hallway.

“Why don’t you get jealous?”

I paused, then laughed lightly. “You’re siblings, aren't you? Isn’t kissing your sibling normal?”

I had thrown his own words, the very words he’d used to wound me, right back in his face.

Rhys’s expression was an ugly mask of displeasure.

“This new you... I can’t read you at all. Just stop hiding what you’re thinking, okay?”

“I’m not hiding anything. What’s wrong with you?” I countered.

His voice rose in frustration. “It’s your attitude! The way you’re acting! It just... makes me uncomfortable.”

I feigned confusion. “What attitude do you want? Do you want me to grab Dakota’s hair and slap her until—”

My sentence was cut short by his sudden roar of anger.

“Do you have to be a crazy bitch who only knows how to hit people? Try touching her again, I dare you!”

I stared at him, saying nothing.

Rhys couldn't articulate why he was so enraged.

In the midst of the stalemate, Dakota ran out, wrapped her arms around Rhys’s elbow, and playfully punched him on the arm.

“What are you two fighting about this time? Don’t bully Avery. You know she’s sensitive. Come on, be a man, take a page from my book.” She winked at me. “I never bother with little people or women. Let’s go cut the cake.”

Rhys’s friends, though morally questionable, were generous when it came to appearances. I walked away from that party with nearly a million dollars in gifts.

“Avery, I didn’t get you a gift, but I’ll give you a demo of the new moves I taught Rhys in bed last night. His old ones are boring as hell. And he kept calling me ‘baby’ and ‘sweetheart’—so tacky. Really—”

Dakota’s bragging was interrupted by the sound of Rhys slamming his phone against the wall.

“Enough! Why are you talking about this?”

Dakota rolled her eyes. “I can talk about whatever I want! You were willing to do it, but you’re too scared to let me talk about it? Why? Was it not you calling me ‘baby’?”

She sat down intimately next to me and took my hand.

The necklace around her throat slipped out of her shirt—the one Rhys had promised me. I stared at it, a fraction of a second too long. Dakota noticed.

“This necklace is eighty million dollars. They called it ‘Heart of True Love’—such a cheesy name. But hey, the ungrateful son bought it for me, so I’ll take it.”

Rhys looked sick.

Instinctively, I reached out. Rhys’s expression snapped into horror, and he roughly yanked my wrist away, shoving me aside.

“Are you trying to hurt Dakota again? When are you going to get rid of this toxic need to attack her?”

My head slammed against the edge of the low table. I felt the warm flow of blood instantly.

“You…” Rhys stammered, his mouth open.

It hurt, sure.

But it was nothing new. Rhys had let me suffer plenty of small, stinging wounds for Dakota’s sake. The difference was that this time, the wound in my heart was already gone.

I stood up calmly, walked over to Dakota, and plucked a stray strand of hair off the surface of the diamond necklace.

“It’s a beautiful piece.”

A snagged hair could easily pull a diamond out of its setting, devaluing it considerably.

The room was silent.

I looked at Rhys, perfectly composed. “I’m going to the ER to get stitched up. You should stay here and keep the party going.”

Rhys followed me out. He grabbed my shoulders, his eyes full of anguish.

“I’m sorry, I just had a knee-jerk reaction. Let me come with you to the doct—”

“Rhys! Get back here! Dakota just passed out!”

Rhys looked back and forth, torn.

As his perfect, understanding girlfriend, I had to be empathetic.

“Go back. She looks worse than I do.”

His guilt deepened.

“I… I’ll go back, then. I was wrong. I’ll make it up to you. Send me everything you want—I’ll buy you all of it!”

The ATM had spoken. There was no way I was going to refuse.

I was ruthless, selecting close to half a billion dollars in high-end assets. Perhaps due to extreme guilt, Rhys authorized the transfers without batting an eye.

“Avery, I did a lot of thinking yesterday. I think it’s time we got married. Next week, maybe.”

I paused mid-scroll, looking up at him with a playful smile. “Sounds great. What kind of prenup and settlement are we talking about?”

Rhys frowned slightly. “I don’t really know about the specifics, but I promise I’ll make you the happiest bride in the entire City.”

I thought Rhys was just placating me with a fleeting promise, and I was only in it for the collateral.

But he actually started planning the wedding.

When his assistant came over to present the list of assets to be put in my name, it took half an hour just to read through it.

“Mrs. Easton, the boss is so good to you. A royal princess wouldn’t receive half this much.”

I just smiled, asking the System in my mind.

“Anything designated for me, I can take, correct?”

“Yes, Host. Also, I must inform you that the male lead’s love index has increased by five points.”

“Oh.”

And what of it?

On the day of the wedding, I was debating whether to simply dematerialize in front of him just to watch him panic.

Rhys burst into the room, his expression frantic. He walked straight up to me, eyes red-rimmed, and couldn't speak.

“What’s wrong with him?” I asked the System.

“Dakota Riley staged a fake kidnapping because she’s pregnant and doesn’t want him to marry you. Also, she’s arranged for the fake kidnappers to target you next.”

“Do I leave now? One less headache.”

A headache? Not quite.

“What happened?” I asked gently, taking Rhys’s trembling hand.

He gasped for breath, his voice raw. “Dakota was kidnapped, Avery. I… I might have to postpone the wedding.”

“It’s okay. Go. You have to find Dakota. A life is more important than a wedding.”

Rhys hugged me tightly, overwhelmed with gratitude. “Thank you, Avery. When I get her back, I’ll make it up to you. I swear.”

After he left, the wedding was canceled. On my way back to the apartment, I was ambushed and knocked unconscious.

When I woke, I was tied up next to Dakota.

One of the kidnappers held a knife, tracing the blade along Dakota’s throat, then mine. He looked at Rhys, who had arrived with a briefcase.

“You have ten million dollars. It can only save one person. Your sister-figure, or your future wife?”

Rhys clenched his fist, his eyes bloodshot. Before he could speak, Dakota cried out, hysterical.

“Rhys! I’m pregnant! It’s your baby! Are you going to let both of us die?”

“You’re pregnant?” Rhys sounded stunned.

Dakota nodded desperately. “Rhys, my stomach hurts so badly! Save our child!”

When he looked back at me, his eyes were full of tortured anguish.

“I’m sorry, Avery. Dakota is in pain, I have to take her to the hospital first. But I will come back for you, I promise.”

I burst into a desperate performance of tears and screams, struggling until the ropes cut into my wrists.

“Rhys! I don’t want to die! I’m your fiancée! How can you leave me here to die?”

Despite my tearful pleas, Rhys was silent. He lowered his head, trembling, and handed the ten million to the kidnappers. He picked up Dakota and looked back at me.

“I’ll compensate you, Avery. Tell me what you want, and it’s yours.”

His choice was solid, immutable. The person who mattered most to him was, and always would be, Dakota Riley.

I offered a small, terrible smile, my eyes wide with manufactured despair.

“I want your company. Do you still promise?”

“I’ve already decided you’re my wife. You can have the company. Everything I have is yours. Just this once, Avery, please. Just this once. I promise I’ll be back for you. Wait for me!”

He turned and walked away without looking back.

I let the tears vanish from my face, replacing the anguish with a strange, cold indifference.

“Rhys Easton, I don’t want you anymore.”

His figure paused momentarily before disappearing from sight.

“System, activate de-linking.”

I was finally going home.
