Don't be fooled by my ordinary appearance as a small-time mukbang streamer.
But I never purge.
"Eat More Today" is my online username.
My real name is Bella Tang.
But I've never felt full since I was little.
So be careful when choosing names, okay?
It's not that my family was poor.
They say I cried day and night when I was a newborn.
My mom almost went crazy.
Until my grandma came to visit and made me a full bottle of milk.
I only stopped crying after drinking it all.
My mom was puzzled why my formula intake was over ten times the feeding guidelines.
It's like I was literally starving for a month.
They say my first word was "eat food".
My mom always says,
There's nothing in the house I haven't tried to chew on, except the toilet.
Everyone in the family eats from bowls.
But I use a pot.
Because it's too tiring to keep going back for more food each meal.
All the buffet restaurants in my hometown have circulated my photo to their staff.
As soon as I show up, they pay me to go eat at their competitors!
My parents even took me to the hospital, but the doctor said I was very healthy.
He said some people are just born with big appetites and good digestion.
During my teenage years,
I tried to eat less like other girls.
But by afternoon, I would feel dizzy.
By the next meal, I couldn't pretend anymore.
The bowls of rice I ate could stack up half a meter high.
My classmates were stunned by how much I could eat.
They said I was born to be a mukbang streamer.
It turned out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.
My mom always worried I wouldn't earn enough to feed myself after getting a job.
But I do, I do.
After all, how can eating not be included when your job is to eat?
After graduation, I couldn't find a job, so I started livestreaming my daily meals.
Somehow people started treating me as a mukbang streamer.
In reality, I was just eating normally.
Although my stream doesn't have as many viewers as the big streamers, it's steady.
Many fans say they've never seen a streamer who broadcasts three meals a day like me.
More punctual than an alarm clock.
And I chew slowly and enjoyably.
They praise me for making eating look so delicious!
Of course, I always eat on time, sleep early and wake up early, never picky about food, and enjoy every bite.
Many people treat me as their virtual dining companion.
I picked up the red envelope Mrs. Quinn gave me.
"Thank you so much! I need to go digest now!"
Her eyes lit up with curiosity, "Digest?"
Zach had an "I knew it" look on his face, "Eating so much and still so thin, heh."
I patted him.
"You eat too little. Your stomach is empty. Otherwise, we could go together."
Mrs. Quinn looked excited.
"Why don't I come along? Can I see the secrets of this industry?"
I was a bit confused.
Don't rich people know how to digest after meals?
