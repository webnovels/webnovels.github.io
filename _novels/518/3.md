I led them along the street and started walking.
Clapping my hands in front and behind while walking.
"Walk a hundred steps after meals, hey, live to ninety-nine, hey!"
Then raising and lowering my arms, crossing to pat my shoulders.
"Rotate to balance yin and yang, boost yang and strengthen the body!"
Then snapping my fingers with both hands.
"Snap snap, worries go away, hey!"
Half an hour later, I closed my eyes contentedly.
Mrs. Quinn's pupils were shaking.
"This is what you meant by digesting...?"
Zach's expression was like he'd seen a ghost, his lips pressed tightly together.
I nodded.
"Don't you know how to digest after meals?"
"I do this set of after-meal walking exercises every day."
Mrs. Quinn suddenly jumped up.
She quickly pressed another envelope into my hand.
"Good, good, good. Here's $1,500. Please eat with him for a month first."
"I'll also arrange for a chef to come. You can have food made according to your requests."
Look at that, I have to brag to my mom.
People who know how to eat always have good luck!
$30,000 a month!
Mrs. Quinn insisted on sending me home.
The next day, she sent Zach to live across from me.
"I thought about it. Going to my place might make you uncomfortable. Sending him to you is more convenient."
"His nickname is Big Strong. He's a year younger than you."
She left without looking back after saying that.
That's when I realized they had bought the apartment across from me overnight.
They really are wealthy...
When will I become one of the rich people in this world!
I looked at Zach, whose thin legs looked like ostrich legs.
"Big Strong?"
He slammed the door shut with a bang.
Then opened it a crack, speaking haughtily.
"My name is Zach."
Oh well, I told you to be careful when choosing names!
Diligent eater, he doesn't eat!
"Okay, Big Strong!"
