The next morning, I prepared breakfast.
Then I knocked on Zach's door.
Seeing the table full of food I had prepared,
Each dish in colorful plates,
His handsome face looked as pretty as my plates.
What's that phrase? A feast for the eyes.
I had Zach sit at the other end of the long table.
Then I set up my phone on a stand and started the livestream.
My regular viewers know my streams are very quiet.
I only say a few words.
"Hello everyone, it's breakfast time! Here are today's delicious dishes."
"Bella is going to start eating."
Then I focus on enjoying the food.
I first took a bite of the yam, hawthorn and date cake. The sweet and sour taste really opens up the appetite.
Zach sat across from me. As I kept chewing and chewing,
He couldn't help but pick up a piece of cake too.
Then he drank some porridge just like me.
I watched him slowly and robotically mimic my movements.
I couldn't help but share.
"Big Strong, I pickled the side dishes myself. They're super fragrant!"
Suddenly comments started flooding the stream.
"Is the streamer eating breakfast with someone else today? So last night...??"
"Wah, my little cabbage has found a pig."
"Who is it? Which pig dares to go after my soft and tender bun!"
I laughed and explained.
"My little brother is visiting. I'll be eating with him for a while.
He won't be on camera. The stream content won't change!"
"Oh it's her brother. The streamer is so cute, her brother hehe, let us see him too."
"I just like watching the streamer, don't distract us."
"It's her brother, that's fine then. As long as it's not a pig going after a cabbage."
"Too bad my son is only in first grade, otherwise streamer you should wait for him."
The comments often make me laugh.
After I finished eating everything, I ended the stream.
"All done, bye bye, see you at lunch!"
As I was cleaning up the dishes, Zach stood in front of me with narrowed eyes, his voice rising.
"Little brother?"
Though thin, he had a large frame and broad shoulders, completely blocking the kitchen entrance.
"Little brother Big Strong, what's wrong?"
I pushed him aside. As I expected, no chest muscles. Disappointing.
"You..."
He moved away from the door, changing the subject.
"Other people do product promotions all day. Do you earn enough to cover how much you eat?"
I opened my phone to show him the viewer count.
Now I have over a thousand people watching me eat every day.
Although I never promote products or make big money,
I can at least break even.
He really knows how to hit where it hurts. I gave him a long look.
He let out a light snort and raised his head, not saying anything more.
I started doing my post-meal exercises.
"Big Strong, join me! When you eat food you made yourself, it feels different."
I went up to him to teach him the movements. His fingers were so long, like a hand model's.
I couldn't help but pinch them!
He pulled back slightly, his ears turning suspiciously red.
"What... what are you doing?"
"I'm teaching you! You have to do it like this, pound your tiger's mouth to strengthen your spleen and stomach."
He acted annoyed.
But following my one-two-three-four rhythm, his hands also moved a bit.
Like a 90-year-old grandma doing the tango in a wheelchair - 10 beats behind!
Just then, a voice suddenly came from the door.
The door opened with an angry shout.
A bouquet of roses was thrown to the ground.
