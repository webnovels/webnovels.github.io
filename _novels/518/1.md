He even picked up the bowl and took a few sips of mushroom soup.
The lady beside him watched with tears in her eyes.
But I only stared at his unfinished bowl.
"Um, are you not going to finish that? Can I drink it?"
He looked at the table full of empty dishes.
Silently, he moved a little to the side.
The beautiful lady tried to help me out, "Bella, are you still hungry?"
I scratched my head and nodded sheepishly.
"Well, the portions here are a bit small. Each plate only has this much."
She looked at the dozen or so empty plates on the table and quietly ordered another table full of food.
My eyes lit up.
This place is so delicious, the mushroom soup is to die for.
Soon I finished everything again.
The handsome guy saw me constantly eyeing his bowl with desire.
He couldn't help but take a few more sips.
I wiped my mouth and started eating the fruit platter.
Zach finally couldn't help but ask.
"You can still eat fruit?"
I looked at him curiously.
"Fruit is so delicious, why wouldn't I be able to eat it?"
He reached out and put a slice of honeydew in his mouth.
I felt a pang of regret in my eyes.
Unconsciously, I pulled the fruit platter closer to myself.
The beautiful lady's eyes were full of excitement.
She grabbed my hand.
"Bella, I'm begging you, please eat with my son every day."
"Oh, don't worry, I'll cover all the food expenses. You just need to be there."
"$15,000, how about $15,000 a month?"
It turned out the handsome guy had anorexia, and it was so severe he needed IV fluids.
I looked at her in surprise. Was there really such a good job?
Seeing I didn't respond, she said, "Is that too little? $30,000 then."
Zach suddenly let out a light snort.
"Mom, let's go. If we don't leave soon, she'll have nowhere to purge!"
I stared at him blankly. You can insult my character,
But don't insult my eating habits.
If there weren't four eyes watching me, I'd be a bit embarrassed.
I could still eat another table full.
Food is so precious, I never waste it.
