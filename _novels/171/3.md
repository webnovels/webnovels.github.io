Jasper approached, looking at Lachlan's departing figure, and asked.

"Who was that?"

Caught off guard, thinking about whether to come clean, he suddenly looked at me, unconcerned, and started berating me.

"Why are you still here and not answering your phone? How long are you going to keep this up? Do I have to come pick you up personally every time? When will you change your spoiled heiress attitude?"

"Our Jasper family has always been kind and gentle. If you don't tone down your drama, how will you marry into our family?"

Looking at him like this, my earlier worries seemed unnecessary. I smiled bitterly.

Just as I was starting to feel anxious, considering whether to reveal everything, he suddenly looked at me. Unconcerned, he immediately began a stream of criticisms.

"Why haven't you returned after all this time? You don't answer calls either. How long are you going to keep this up? Do I have to come and get you myself before you'll stop your spoiled behavior?"

"Our Meng family has always been kind and gentle. If you don't curb this dramatic attitude, how will you marry into our family in the future?"

Seeing him like this, my earlier worries seemed unnecessary, and I gave a bitter smile.

"Jasper, we've already broken up. I’m not going to marry you. What you're worried about won't happen. You can leave."

He froze, then tried to soothe me as he used to.

"Adeline, I made a mistake, but I explained everything over the phone. Once she has the baby, I'll send her abroad. She won't be in your way."

He stepped forward to grab me, but I subtly dodged.

He paused awkwardly, his hand dropping to his side, his temper flaring up again.

"I've explained so many times and even came to get you. What more do you want? Do I have to pay forever for one mistake?"

I wasn't feeling wronged, yet he was acting like he was. It was amusing.

"You did nothing wrong, and there's no need to apologize. I'm just tired. Let's end things amicably without making it ugly."

Seeing my determination, he got a bit panicked, grabbing me with a voice desperate and humble.

"Adeline, please, my dear, I really messed up. There's nothing between me and Phoebe. She's just a junior colleague. That incident was an accident. I love you, only you. Please, let's not fight. Come home with me, okay?"

I stepped back to avoid his touch and bluntly exposed him.

"Last month was an accident, but what about last night?"

"When I was excitedly waiting at the City Hall to marry you, where were you? At the office, a hotel, or in Phoebe's bed?"

He staggered back, clearly flustered, and after a moment, apologized sincerely.

"I'm sorry, I drank too much last night."

As he spoke, he tried to grab me again, attempting to sweet-talk like before.

But Phoebe's call interrupted him, and hearing the familiar ringtone, he hesitated, looking at my expressionless face.

I knew it was a ringtone he set specifically for Phoebe. I mocked him.

"Go ahead, answer it. She might get emotional and affect her pregnancy."

He didn't catch the underlying meaning, genuinely released me, and answered the call.

As he stepped away, he even complimented me.

"You're so understanding, thank you."

Watching him pace back and forth, getting increasingly anxious, I found it amusing.

At that moment, eight years of relationship felt like a joke.

Silently declaring my foolishness.

As the call wrapped up, he turned towards me, looking conflicted.

When I looked back, there stood a man marked by time, respectfully addressing me.

"Madam, Mr. Lachlan sent me to pick you up."

Jasper returned just in time to see this, his eyes filled with unease.

"Who is he, and why did he call you madam?"

I had the driver Lachlan sent wait aside before explaining.

"He's my family's driver, Uncle Zack."

"When did your family change drivers?"

Jasper was preoccupied with the situation at home involving Phoebe, thinking it was a personnel change in my family, and had already dismissed his earlier curiosity about why the driver called me madam.

Even asking when the driver changed was more of an afterthought, with no intention of delving into the truth.

So, after asking, he ignored my resistance and dragged me into his car.

On the way back, he didn't forget to scold and warn me.

"It's your attitude that's causing the problem. Phoebe was worried and insisted I come find you. Now look, she tried to make something to eat and ended up falling."

"When we get back, control your temper. Phoebe is also a victim in this. Don't be so malicious."

As he endlessly criticized me, he seemed to forget that just minutes ago, he was apologizing and asking for forgiveness for cheating last night.

I didn't respond, just glanced in the rearview mirror to see the concerned Uncle Zack. I waved him off, signaling him to go back.

Back at the house, the first thing I saw was Phoebe struggling to get up.

Jasper quickly released my hand and rushed to pick her up.

In his arms, Phoebe wore a smug smile.

Jasper anxiously carried her to the sofa, thoroughly checking for injuries. Only when he found none did he relax.

He didn't notice that when he passed me, he bumped me aside, causing me to hit the corner of the dining table with a sharp intake of breath.

Looking at me leaning against the table, he ordered unhappily.

"What are you standing there for? Phoebe got hurt because of you. Go make some light dishes and apologize to her!"

His cold demeanor felt unfamiliar.

Seeing me motionless, he got annoyed and, surprisingly, put on a cartoon apron.

As he headed to the kitchen, his grumbling continued.

"I know I made a mistake, but I've apologized. What more do you want? Holding onto this endlessly, is it fun?"

"I'll make this meal for you. Use this time to think clearly. I hope when we eat, you won't sulk like everyone owes you."

Watching his skilled cooking, I felt a sense of disorientation.

In our eight years together, he never cooked.

Every time I cooked, he never hesitated to praise me.

"Adeline, you're wonderful. Having you is happiness."

But when I asked to try his cooking, he always said his hands were for research, not cooking.

Yet now, this skillful scene, who is it for?

The answer was clear.

Watching his adept cooking, emotions surged, and tears silently fell.

I turned away and went to the bedroom to pack my things.

Upon entering, I found all my belongings replaced by Phoebe's items.

Even my custom wardrobe was filled with her various outfits.

I rushed to the bedroom, opened the nightstand, and found my important documents replaced by a box of glaring condoms.

Overwhelmed with anger, I stormed out to confront Phoebe.

"Where are my things?"

Unexpectedly, Phoebe, who was leisurely eating watermelon, suddenly acted like she was facing a formidable enemy.

She answered timidly.

"Adeline, I'm sorry. Your things were moved to the storage room by the maid."

I grabbed her hand, my anger palpable.

"Who gave you permission to touch my things?"

Hearing this, she dropped her pretense, gazing past me with a smirk.

"What do you think?"

The watermelon in my other hand slipped away. She grabbed my hand, and in the commotion, she deliberately stepped on the watermelon rind and fell hard.
