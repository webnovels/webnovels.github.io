Over the phone, I heard the doctor's reprimand.

"Phoebe's family, she's been pregnant for over a month. How could you sleep together? What kind of husband are you, so irresponsible?"

Jasper instinctively wanted to explain but was distracted by Phoebe's weak cough, so his explanation turned into an apology.

"Sorry, I'll be more careful."

My fingers tightened as I took a deep breath and made a decision.

"Jasper, let's break up."

Hearing my words, the initial guilt evaporated, replaced by a flood of blame.

"Cora, what are you throwing a fit about? Is it fun to compete with a pregnant woman for attention?"

"Every time there's a problem, all you do is threaten to break up. Have you ever really left? After eight years, who else would want you? Do you dare to really break up?"

His words were like sharp knives, stabbing straight into my heart.

This was the 99th time Jasper stood me up for Phoebe.

The previous 98 times, Phoebe always had some excuse to call him away whenever we were about to get our certificate.

The first time, she had just returned to the country and needed a pick-up.

The second time, she twisted her ankle in high heels, and Jasper rushed to take her to the hospital.

...

The 98th time, she got drunk and was being followed by some men. She called Jasper crying, and without hesitation, he left me on the roadside and sped off.

That night, without my phone, I walked over ten kilometers to get home.

When I opened the door, I saw him holding Phoebe on the sofa.

Seeing me, Phoebe sat up first, tears in her eyes, pitifully explaining.

"Adeline, I'm sorry, it's not what you think. I was just so scared, and Jasper was just comforting me."

I looked at her, my words sharp with sarcasm.

"What kind of comfort needs you to be in each other's arms?"

Jasper shielded her behind him, reprimanding me.

"She was just frightened and couldn't sleep. I just lent her my shoulder for security. She's just my junior. Cora, can't you be more generous? Stop being jealous over everything, you seem so bitter and mean."

That night, we had a huge fight.

And just like now, I suggested breaking up.

But back then, the breakup was mixed with sadness and grievance, wanting comfort, wanting someone to coax me.

Every time it was the same.

Every time he stood me up for Phoebe, I'd get angry and suggest breaking up.

But within a couple of days, I'd fall for his sweet talk and forgive him.

Never thinking that this would become a weapon he could use to stab at my heart.

Not hearing my answer, Jasper realized he was too harsh and softened his tone.

"Alright, Adeline, stop being petty. I didn’t mean it. I just made a mistake every man makes, and it was planned. You know, in our line of work, these things happen often. I really couldn't prevent it."

"I promise you, I won't let her threaten your place as my wife. Once the baby is born, we'll get married, and I'll give you a grand wedding. Don't be sad, okay?"

"Where are you now? Still at City Hall? I'll come pick you up."

Before I could speak, he was drawn away by Phoebe's groans of pain.

"Phoebe's not feeling well, she can't be left alone. You take a cab back first, and later, I'll buy you your favorite crawfish."

The call ended, and I stared at the black screen of my phone, laughing until tears came to my eyes.

Jasper, why do you think I, the heiress of New York's Johnson family, would want a man with a tarnished reputation?

And why do you think someone like me, a beauty queen of Southwest F4, would be unwanted?

Watching the crowd disperse at City Hall, I snapped a picture and sent it to his arch-enemy, Lachlan, the playboy of New York.

Captioned: "Does what you said about the certificate still count?"
