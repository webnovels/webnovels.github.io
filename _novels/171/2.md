As Lachlan was entering the airport, he saw the message and didn't think twice. He delayed his flight, jumped on a helicopter, and rushed over, afraid he'd miss his chance.

When I saw him, he was breathless, drenched in sweat, clearly having run over from the helicopter.

Without a word, he grabbed my hand and headed to the counter.

Just in time, the staff stamped the papers, and I could hear his sigh of relief.

Outside City Hall, he waved the red certificate in my face, looking smug.

"Now you're really mine, don't even think of escaping."

Watching him, as happy as a child, I was in a daze. Was this the same Lachlan I knew?

I remember once when Jasper left me in the pouring rain because of Phoebe, Lachlan drove by and splashed water all over me.

Already soaked, I broke down in tears right in front of him.

The usually rebellious Lachlan suddenly panicked.

He took off his jacket, draped it over me, awkwardly pulled me into a hug, and half-jokingly said.

"What's the big deal about getting married? Does it have to be Jasper? What about me?"

"He loves competing with me over business, so I'll steal his wife. Marry me? I promise no cheating, no divorce, just till death do us part."

Back then, when my heart was all about Jasper, I pushed him away and slapped him.

He didn't get mad; instead, he was more serious than ever.

"I'm serious. Think about it."

The sincerity that night and the innocence now seemed nothing like the playboy rumored to be all about partying.

"Why aren't you saying anything? Are you regretting it?"

Lachlan's voice pulled me back, and I shook my head at him.

"No."

He then relaxed, taking my hand and saying.

"Come on, I'll take you home."

Thinking about how he rushed here breathlessly, he must have something urgent, so I said understandingly.

"If you have business, you can go ahead. Don't worry about me."

As soon as I said that, his assistant, who had been waiting for a chance to speak, finally interjected.

"CEO, the lady has spoken. We need to hurry, or we'll miss it."

Lachlan then explained that he was supposed to fly to the Middle East for a big project today but delayed it to rush over when he saw my message.

This reminded me of a time when Jasper, as a core researcher of airplane parts, was invited for international exchange.

It was right when I was having surgery for a cervical tumor, and I reluctantly asked if he could leave a day later.

He held my hand and comforted me helplessly.

"I'm going for work, it's an organizational arrangement, not for fun. Stop fussing, I'll come back as soon as it's over, okay?"

But that night, just out of surgery, I saw on Facebook someone sharing a photo of him passionately kissing Phoebe abroad.

Turns out, love and not-love were already clear.

Feeling moved, I patted Lachlan's shoulder, signaling for him to go.

He instructed the driver to take me home and then left reluctantly.

As we parted, I noticed a familiar Porsche Cayenne parked at 12 o'clock in the distance, with Jasper getting out of the car.
