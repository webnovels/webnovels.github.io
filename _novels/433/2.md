Suppressing my thoughts, I didn't want to argue with them here. It was pointless.

I looked at Samuel and said calmly:

"Weren't you here to pick me up? Let's go."

The scene went quiet for a moment, and they exchanged glances before suddenly bursting into laughter.

Rachel sneered coldly:

"Wait for you? Who do you think you are?!"

She pointed at the sign, "Look carefully, we're waiting for Olivia. Do you know who that is?"

This was my English name, of course I knew.

"Olivia is Mrs. Young, the lady of the Young family, and the legal wife of Mr. Young."

"Mr. Young is decisive in the business world, but he's actually quite the romantic. They say he refused to marry for years, just waiting for Olivia."

"Everyone in the circle knows that rather than trying to please Mr. Young, it's better to please Mrs. Young. She's the apple of Mr. Young's eye."

Hearing their chatter, a happy smile appeared on my face.

After three years of marriage, Gabriel's business had grown bigger and bigger, and his reputation as a wife-doting maniac had spread far and wide.

Rachel, always trying to one-up me, couldn't resist showing off in front of me:

"Mr. Young once bought a 'True Love Forever' bracelet at Christie's auction for $20 million... US dollars, just to please Mrs. Young."

"Mrs. Young is the envy of women all over the world."

She paused, then pointed at my wrist and said shrilly:

"It's this one!"

The scene suddenly went quiet, with everyone looking at my bracelet.

Samuel grabbed my hand abruptly, examining it for a moment before saying mockingly:

"The imitation is quite exquisite! Which delivery guy bought this for you? Giving fake gifts."

"Trash."

I shook off his hand, curled my lips into a smile, and gently caressed the bracelet.

Seeing my happy smile, Samuel's pupils constricted, and he suddenly grabbed my wrist, roughly rubbing the bracelet.

I hadn't expected this to happen and was caught off guard.

Rachel stepped forward to examine the bracelet, taking it from Samuel's hand and playing with it.

"It is indeed more exquisite than the imitation I bought, but I would never wear it out. It's embarrassing."

"The imitations from abroad are really different, the feel is quite nice."

"Or are you saying, Olivia, that you're Olivia, that legendary Mrs. Young?!"

As she finished speaking, the people around burst into laughter.

After all, it was too absurd for them to believe.

Gabriel Young was a world-renowned financial genius, cold and ruthless in the business world, decisive and unforgiving.

And I was still hanging out with them three years ago, a nobody whose wedding was called off by Samuel.

No matter how they thought about it, it seemed impossible.

Rachel twirled the bracelet around her finger.

"Olivia, why don't you give me this bracelet? I'll pay double for it."

Afraid she might drop the bracelet, I quickly said:

"Give me back the bracelet, it was given to me by Gabriel..."

Before I could finish, Samuel slapped me hard across the face, making my head turn and drawing blood from the corner of my mouth.

"Shut up!"
