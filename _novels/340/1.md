The moment my words left my lips, both of them, tangled together just moments before, froze.

They clearly didn't expect me to butt in like that, to utter such a thing.

A moment later, Julian turned to me, his eyes flickering with a hint of doubt.

I knew he didn't believe I was being sincere.

Reliving this life, having endured the betrayal of the last one…

I'd already come to terms with the fact that Julian held no true love for me.

No, he just wanted my body, playing a calculated part.

As I pondered this, Julian resumed his act.

"We're not even in the same league, Seraphina. You're just an intern doctor. Do you even realize the gap between us?"

An intern doctor?

At that, a long-buried memory surfaced in my mind.

In my previous life, Julian had met an intern doctor at the hospital while he was admitted for an illness.

Their relationship had clearly developed at lightning speed behind my back.

By the time I found out, I'd already sensed something was off.

But back then, I was far too naive.

I intended to investigate, but Julian preemptively distanced himself entirely from that relationship.

At the time, I didn't think much of it.

I assumed it was just the intern doctor being overly persistent, so I naturally lowered my guard.

But recalling it now, it was probably a carefully orchestrated charade by Julian himself.

He might have already discovered I was investigating, so he reacted in advance.

Thinking of this, all I felt was self-mockery.

I couldn't believe I'd been so foolish.

Kept in the dark for so long, without the slightest inkling.

Now, knowing the whole story, it was like a sudden epiphany, everything clicking into place.

Fine, Julian. This time, I'll grant your wish.

Since you like Seraphina, I'll step aside.

A divorce is nothing; I have all the time in the world.

I made my decision.

My tragic death in the last life had left me utterly clear-headed now.

I wasn't about to jump into the same pit of fire twice.

"Just leave. You're not welcome here."

When I snapped back to reality, I heard Julian's voice, his tone ice-cold.

And I, without hesitation, cut in.

"Julian, why are you being so heartless towards a girl? Is there anything wrong with her staying here?"

"Anya, I don't want her to affect our relationship."

"Oh? Is our relationship so fragile that one girl's appearance can shatter it into pieces? Hah, well, in that case, she definitely doesn't need to leave."

At this moment, I'd already anticipated the subsequent events.

In my last life, I hadn't stopped Julian.

In fact, I continued to target Seraphina, which ultimately led to Seraphina's death in a car accident.

I suspected that this very incident was the cause of my eventual tragedy.

Because of this, I had no intention of repeating my past mistakes.

I even wanted to fulfill the desires of that toxic couple.

But as my words fell, Julian's expression subtly shifted, looking extremely serious.

"Anya, she certainly can't affect our relationship or our feelings. I just worry you'll overthink things. You know I'm a man of integrity."

"Overthink? She's not that important. You don't need to drive anyone away for my sake. I don't want people to think I'm petty and jealous."

With that final remark, I had no intention of meddling in their relationship any further.

Yet, even so, Julian still swore to me, full of conviction.

"Alright then, Anya. But I swear, Seraphina and I are completely innocent!"

Watching Julian's seemingly sincere expression, all I felt was sick to my stomach.
