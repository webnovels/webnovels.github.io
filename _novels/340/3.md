For a moment, it felt like the world had lost all sound.

Grandma Helen was dead?

No way. In my previous life, her surgery was perfectly successful!

Why?

Why was this happening?

"I'm sorry, we did our best."

"This isn't about doing your best! Why is my grandma dead? You guaranteed me earlier that this surgical technique was very mature!"

My mind replayed what he'd said about a rejection reaction.

Why would this happen?

My brain practically shut down.

I felt like the very ground beneath me had vanished.

At the same time, Grandma Helen's hospital bed was wheeled out of the operating room.

Her face was pale, and she looked utterly peaceful in her sleep.

Seeing this, my tears wouldn't stop flowing.

But unexpectedly, a fleeting glance caught my eye: a doctor standing at the back of the crowd.

She wore a mask, and her eyes darted away, but I instantly sensed something.

Without a moment's hesitation, I rushed forward, and the next second, I tore off her mask.

"Seraphina, it's you? Where's the lead surgeon?!"

I'd found the source of all this wrongness.

And my furious questioning brought the entire crowd to a stunned silence.

I finally understood the reason for Grandma Helen's death.

It was because I had indulged Seraphina, and it ultimately led to Grandma Helen's demise!

My original intention was just to expose their affair, but in the end, I lost the person who loved me most.

It was all because of Seraphina!

In an instant, my grief was consumed by rage.

"Is this your hospital's professional conduct? An intern doctor as the lead surgeon for an organ transplant?! You're killing for profit!"

My expression grew increasingly agitated. Just as everyone else was at a loss for what to do, Julian suddenly stepped in front of me.

"Seraphina, what's going on here? With your skill, an accident like this shouldn't have happened!"

Julian and Seraphina exchanged glances.

Snapping back to reality, Seraphina quickly replied.

"The rejection reaction was too strong this time, and the patient's physical condition wasn't good, which led to this tragedy. I'm very sorry."

Hearing this, Julian turned back to me, taking my hand and continuing.

"Anya, I know Seraphina's skills. No one wanted a tragedy like this to happen. I understand your grief right now, but rejection reactions are an inherent risk in transplant surgeries. Grandma Helen was old, and you know her physical condition. This time, even if we had an experienced surgeon, it might not have been successful. Don't let this upset you too much and harm your own health."

Julian appeared to be seeking justice for me, but every word he spoke was an attempt to cover for Seraphina.

And his lengthy defense gained the approval of most of the doctors and nurses present.

Seeing this, I found it utterly laughable.

With my previous life's experience, how could I not guess the true situation?

But to my dismay, the female nurses around me all stepped forward to defend Seraphina.

"Mr. Hayes is right. This was purely an accident. Doctor Seraphina did her best at the first sign of rejection. She took every possible emergency measure. So, please, Ms. Reed, accept our condolences."

As more and more people started voicing their support for Seraphina, Julian eventually took me back home.

But as soon as we arrived, Julian received a phone call.

After glancing at it, he explained to me that it was work-related.

He left the room, even stepping into the hallway before answering.

He looked so careful and cautious, little did he know, I was listening in.

"Julian, I'm scared something will go wrong."

Seraphina's voice came from the other end of the line.

"Don't worry, I promise you, Anya won't give you any trouble. It was just an accident; everyone thinks so. No one will suspect you."

"Every lead surgeon starts as an intern. You just got some early practice. You don't need to blame yourself too much."

Hearing Julian's reply, I froze instantly.

In a daze, it felt like a vital thread, connecting us, suddenly snapped.

That was the luck aura bound between us.

I hadn't expected that besides divorce, a broken heart could also sever the luck.

At that moment, I regretted my decision to let Seraphina go even more.

If only I had known, Grandma Helen might not have died…

My heart turned to ash as I returned to my room. Soon after, Julian opened the door.

His face was somber, and he immediately started comforting me.

"Anya, don't be too sad about Grandma Helen. It was purely a medical accident; the main reason wasn't the doctors' fault. Grandma Helen was old; it was to be expected."

He was defending Seraphina.

I sneered inwardly but felt no surprise.

Perhaps because of my silence, Julian changed the subject after a moment.

"Anya, are you still coming to the celebration party?"

Celebration party?

I abruptly lifted my head, gritting my teeth.

"Yes, of course, I'm coming."

Not only was I going, but I was going to see him fall from his pedestal.
