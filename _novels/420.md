I used my life force to nurture a beast-man bodyguard.

For six years, I loved and pitied him, pouring out my whole heart only to receive a cold response: "Don't try to tame me."

During the beast riots, he protected another girl, leaving me to be trampled.

He was supposed to be my bodyguard.

Yet he always abandoned me.

He even wrapped his scorpion tail around my neck, forcing me to use my blood to save that girl.

He didn't know that every drop of blood I shed reduced my lifespan.

Nor did he know this was the last of my life force.

"Olivia, I promise I'll be good to you from now on. Please, save her."

The once proud beast-man finally knelt on the ground, acknowledging me as his master.

My fingers gradually became transparent.

"But we don't have a future anymore."
