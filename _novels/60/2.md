After cremating Buddy, I buried him next to my mother's grave. On the third morning, the Professor sent me the exact departure time. I replied with an "okay" and then walked into the HR office. I formally submitted my resignation. They must have disliked me for a long time, as the process went smoothly.

Just as I closed the door of the HR office, I heard them gossiping. "She just up and resigned. Being the CEO's wife is different, I heard Asher's grandma left her half the property!" "What CEO's wife? It's not even official. I think she resigned because Asher gave her project to Miss Daphne." "Wasn't that the project she was working on? It's almost finished. Giving it to Miss Daphne now is like letting her reap the rewards." "So what? Miss Daphne is Asher's true love."

It's not surprising they thought that way. As soon as Daphne returned, Asher gave her the General Manager position. Even if Daphne knew nothing, Asher would hand the project to her himself. He even had me work overtime to revise Daphne's proposals and entertain her clients. Even when I ended up hospitalized with a bleeding stomach, he said I owed it to Daphne.

Listening to the occasional mocking laughter, I felt no waves in my heart. I just hoped the coming days would pass quickly. With everything settled, it was time for me to pack up.

I returned home with my things, only to see Asher and Daphne having breakfast together, laughing and chatting. Watching them feed each other, my hands started to tremble. Once, I mistakenly used Asher's cup, and he hired a dozen cleaners to sanitize the house, warning me not to have physical contact with him.

Turns out Asher didn't have a cleanliness obsession. He just didn't want to be intimate with me. Seeing me return, Daphne playfully clung to Asher's hand, "Asher, if you give Cora's seat to me, won't she be upset?" Asher sneered, "I'm the company's CEO. Do I need her approval for my decisions?"

"But Cora hasn't been home for days." "She's waiting for me to coax her. Don't mind her." Hearing this, Daphne's eyes were full of triumphant pride. She leaned into Asher's embrace, wrapping her arms around his neck coquettishly.

I said nothing and headed upstairs. That's when Asher noticed me. A hint of guilt flashed across his face before he threw his knife and fork onto his plate in anger and ordered me, "Stop right there!"

I kept walking, but he rushed over and grabbed my arm. "Cora, what's your problem? Do you even remember you have a home?" He reached to take the box from my arms, but I turned away. "No need, you go ahead with your work."

Asher looked even more impatient, about to say something when Daphne called him, "Asher, I want another fried egg. Can you make one for me?" "Sure," Asher replied and headed to the kitchen.

I stepped forward to go back to my room, but Daphne blocked my way. "What do you want?" Daphne glanced toward the kitchen, and her gentle facade faded, revealing jealousy and resentment. "Cora, you heard it all, didn't you? Asher only has me in his heart. If it weren't for his grandmother forcing him, he wouldn't marry you."

"I heard his grandma left you half the property. Don't delude yourself into thinking any of it is yours!" "I advise you to be sensible and hand over the property agreement. After all, just one word from me, and he would kick you out."

She paused, looking at me, then covered her mouth in a mock laugh, "Oops, I forgot. All your family is dead. You're like a stray dog no one wants." "No wonder you cling to Asher like a leech."

Her tone was contemptuous, her eyes filled with mockery. No matter how she insulted me, I didn't care. But she shouldn't have mocked my family. In an instant, my blood froze, and I couldn't help but yell at her, "Daphne, say one more word, and I'll tear your mouth apart!"

"Asher! What are you doing!?"

She paused, looked at me, then covered her mouth in a mocking laugh. "Oops, I forgot. Your whole family's gone now. You're just like an unwanted stray."

"No wonder you're stuck to Asher like glue."

Her voice dripped with disdain, her eyes gleaming with amusement.

I could endure any insult she hurled at me, but mocking my family was crossing the line. My blood ran cold, and I couldn't help but shout, "Daphne! Say one more word and I'll make you regret it!"

"Cora! What's gotten into you?!"

Asher happened to overhear, worried I might harm Daphne, and immediately intervened.

I paused, noticing Daphne's raised eyebrow as she subtly pushed me.

The next second, I lost my balance and tumbled down the stairs. Pain shot through me as I hit the ground.

"Cora!" Asher dropped everything and rushed over to help me up.

Daphne leaned toward Asher, tears brimming in her eyes, "Asher, I didn't mean to... It's all my fault for being so clumsy and causing trouble. What should I do now..."

Her panic seemed perfectly genuine, and Asher couldn't bring himself to blame her.

He frowned, looking at me, "Are you okay? Do you need to go to the hospital? Daphne didn't mean it, don't hold it against her."

I shook my head, bitterness seeping in as I looked away, noticing the scattered items.

The resignation letter and confidential documents were right on top.
