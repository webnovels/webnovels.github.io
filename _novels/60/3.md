Afraid he might notice, I ignored the pain and hurried to gather them.

"I'll do it." Asher crouched down, picking up the resignation letter with a frown.

I held my breath, hoping he wouldn't notice the confidential documents.

Luckily, Asher's attention was on the resignation letter, allowing me to hide the documents among other items.

"You quit?" Asher sounded surprised.

"Yeah." I shoved everything into the box.

He sounded displeased, "Why didn't you say so earlier? Before, when I asked you to hand over the project, you refused. Why the change of heart now?"

Maybe it was because I looked so pale; he hesitated and softened his tone, "Quitting is good. Saves me some effort. Grandma gave you so much money, you should be content."

"You should focus on being Mrs. Asher and stop competing with Daphne."

"She's kind-hearted and doesn't understand your scheming."

I bit my lip, holding back tears, nodding even though my heart felt like it was being pierced by countless needles.

I struggled to stand despite the pain. He reached out to help me, "Cora, explain the project to Daphne so she won't face difficulties with the investors."

"She's not like you, able to charm people and even get half the property."

Not wanting to waste more time on them, I nodded to Asher, "Okay."

Asher seemed pleased with my compliance, smiling at me, "That's better. Sorry for neglecting you lately. Once Daphne fully takes over your work, I'll make it up to you."

"After the mourning period for Grandma, we can get married. It'll give her peace."

I bit my lip hard, my heart aching. That day would never come.

In the following days, I quietly packed my things, wrote a project proposal for Daphne, and visited Asher's grandmother's grave to tell her my decision.

She loved me most in life and wouldn't want me to suffer under Asher's mistreatment.

On the last day, Asher stayed home.

I felt anxious, trying to find reasons to leave smoothly.

Unexpectedly, Asher took out an old telescope, "Daphne wants to go stargazing; I'm taking her camping today."

"Alright." I sighed in relief. Leaving early would let me avoid running into him.

He added, "There's a Charity Gala tonight. Get a dress ready for Daphne."

I thought for a moment. By then, I'd be on the way to my new life.

Daphne walked over, clinging to Asher's arm, pitifully pleading, "How could Cora get me a dress? Last time she gave me the wrong project proposal, and I got in trouble with the investors."

"Asher, I can wear anything. I don't want to..."

She even shed a few tears, and Asher glared at me angrily, "Cora, if you don't want to do it, just say so. How could you do this? You've really disappointed me!"

I was about to leave and didn't want any more conflict. I calmly apologized to Daphne, "Sorry, my bad. It won't happen again."

Then I looked at Asher, "Don't worry, I'll prepare the dress for her."

A hint of guilt flashed across Asher's face. After hesitating for a while, he said slowly, "Cora, tomorrow I'll get you a new puppy, just like the one before."

Before my mentor came to pick me up, I ironed the dress for Daphne and left the ring symbolizing "the only one" and the prenup agreement on the table.

With my suitcase in hand, I headed downstairs. The Professor looked at my expressionless face and sighed helplessly.

"Since you've decided to go, work hard over there and achieve results soon!"

"Okay!"

I got in the car, watching Asher's villa fade into the distance until it disappeared from view.

In the early morning, Asher returned home, slightly tipsy, with Daphne.

The house was silent, with no lights on. Asher was instinctively displeased.

After all, no matter how late it was, I would always wait for him on the sofa.

"Cora! Come out and make some hangover soup."

But the empty house remained silent, with no response.

Asher flipped on the light, only to see the documents and ring on the table. He immediately yelled, "Cora! Who allowed you to take off the ring?!"
