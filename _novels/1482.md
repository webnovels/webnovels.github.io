Grandma Evelyn always said I was her favorite out of her seven grandchildren.

Growing up, she gave me countless shoes, clothes, and books.

But Grandma always claimed she couldn't afford new things, so she'd pick up secondhand items for me instead.

Mom and Dad would always say that even if they weren't brand-new, it was the thought that counted with Grandma, so I always felt pressured to accept them graciously.

Later, I graduated from college and landed an offer at a major company.

The whole family threw a party to celebrate.

At the party, Grandma handed me a laptop—another secondhand gift.

In that moment, years of pent-up emotions suddenly hit me.

I grabbed the device and smashed it hard on the floor: "Why is it always secondhand?!"

My relatives immediately called me ungrateful. Grandma wiped away tears and softly said she wouldn't come to our house anymore, so she wouldn't embarrass me.

I didn't say a word. I turned and walked into my room, bringing out all the secondhand items she'd given me over the years, one by one.

The room fell completely silent.
