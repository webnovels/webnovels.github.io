The night of my adopted sister Savannah’s seventeenth birthday.

Dad blew off a major corporate dinner, and Mom gave her the vintage diamond tennis bracelet she’d been saving.

Savannah wore the princess gown I’d bought her. She scolded the catering staff for unsteady hands, after a few drops of soup splattered on her hem. The server bowed low in a pathetic apology, and I smoothly played the role of the good-natured older brother.

“It’s alright, she just has a stomach ache and wasn’t steady. Don’t worry, Princess.”

“Your brother will buy you two more dresses tomorrow.”

The server looked up gratefully, and I froze.

Her face was Mom’s face.

It looked exactly like my little sister, who’d gone missing twelve years ago, would look now.

1

The girl, Chen Yue, had a tiny mole on her earlobe. Her features were uncannily like Mom’s. The instant I saw her, I was certain. My biological sister, gone since she was five, was found.

The moment the DNA results came back.

Mom gripped her rough hands, tears streaming. “Ellie, it’s really you, we’ve been looking for you for twelve years!”

Dad’s eyes were full of aching pity. “It must have been so hard for you all these years.”

Savannah sat in the corner, staring at Chen Yue.

Her faded, ill-fitting clothes squeezed Chen Yue’s round, slightly heavy figure. The rubber soles of her cheap sneakers were worn thin. She stood there, awkward and constrained, twisting her fingers, looking blank and bewildered.

A sharp pang of sorrow hit me.

Little Ellie had been like a pure, white snow-bunnly. She loved clinging to me. The first word she ever learned, when she was barely talking, was “Leo.”

My own sister, reduced to this.

I placed the investigation report on the coffee table, my heart heavy. “Dad, Mom, just read it for yourselves.”

Chen Yue—Ellie—had been abandoned by the traffickers when she developed a high fever on the road at age five; they thought she was going to die. She was picked up by a woman, but the woman’s husband was a monster. He was an abusive alcoholic who killed his wife last year and was sentenced to death.

Since then, Ellie had been completely alone. To support herself while still trying to go to school, she had worked every possible low-wage job—waitress, cleaning crew, delivery driver. She’d even lugged supplies at a warehouse construction site.

Mom and Dad read the report, biting back tears, damning her adoptive father as less than human. They pulled her into a hug, softly patting her back.

“Ellie, don’t be afraid. Dad is here. We’ll change your name this week and enroll you in the best private prep school. No one will ever hurt you again!”

“My poor daughter, I’m so sorry we let you suffer for so long! It’s all my fault, my fault…”

Ellie’s, no, Elena’s, eyes reddened too. She stiffly managed to say, “Mom and Dad.”

My eyes felt hot. “Ellie, I’m your brother, Leo. From now on, I’m your protection.”

We were immersed in the joy of finally having her back, lost and then found.

Until Savannah, pale-faced, brought over a platter of sliced fruit. The girl who was normally so delicate had a testing look on her face.

“Have some fruit, everyone.”

“Mom, please stop crying. You just had that expensive eye treatment yesterday.”

Mom wiped her eyes and playfully glared at her. “I never thought I’d live to see the day you cut up fruit for us.”

Savannah had been in the kitchen maybe a handful of times her entire life. She’d never had to lift a finger; everything was done by Mom or the staff.

She clenched her hand, pouting slightly.

Mom’s sharp eyes spotted the blood. She quickly walked over and took Savannah’s hand, instantly worried. “What happened to your hand?”

“I touched the blade when I was cutting.”

“Why are you so careless? Rick, quick, get the first-aid kit.”

Dad was instantly concerned and hurried into the house. I got up to check the knives in the kitchen, worried she’d left them lying around without common sense, like she sometimes did when she was younger.

The three of us fussed over Savannah for a good while. Once a colorful bandage was applied, we remembered Elena, who was still sitting silently nearby, her eyes empty.

The atmosphere turned strangely awkward.

I explained, “Ellie, this is Savannah. When I was looking for you all those years ago, I heard a baby crying and found her abandoned in a box. She’s like you, she’s had a tough start. Now you’re sisters. Look out for each other.”

Savannah put on a friendly smile, walked over, and extended her hand. “Welcome home, big sister. My room gets the best light, so I’ll move out tonight and let you have it.”

“And you can pick whatever you want from my things. Though I don’t think my clothes or shoes will fit.” She looked Elena up and down, then playfully stuck out her tongue. “You’re bigger than me, sister, and your feet are huge, so I guess I can’t share those.”

“Ah, but maybe that means you haven’t had it too bad all these years. Otherwise, why the happy weight?”

Elena’s face flushed crimson. After a long pause, she managed two clipped words. “I don’t need it.”

I felt a prickle of discomfort. Why was she so cold to Savannah?

Before I could speak, I heard Mom say, “Ellie, you need to be polite.”

“Savannah, there’s plenty of room in this house. There’s no need to move around.”

In the end, Elena was placed in the room next to mine. It was always cool and had previously been Savannah’s storage room. It was the only available space for now, and I was sure Elena would understand.

Elena only brought two things from the run-down apartment: a photo of her and her adoptive mother, and a scruffy orange mutt.

Mom and Dad instantly frowned. Dad was a stickler for cleanliness and didn’t like animals inside. Mom wrinkled her nose at the sight of a common stray. But, considering Elena’s feelings, they said nothing.

Savannah hugged her arms, fear flickering in her eyes. “I’m scared of dogs.”

When did she become afraid of dogs? I didn’t dwell on it.

Elena held the dog tightly, her head bowed, looking vulnerable but resolute. “I only want him.”

Dad and Mom looked displeased.

Savannah said, with a hint of something unreadable, “Sister, you said you couldn’t afford food, but you had money left over to keep a dog?”

I intervened, easing the tension. “Savannah, don’t talk nonsense. This dog must be very important to Ellie.”

“There’s a small utility room behind the backyard gazebo. We can keep him there.”

Elena’s eyes lit up, and she looked at me with gratitude.

We spent the day getting new things for Elena. That evening, I brought a box of limited-edition chocolates I’d bought on a business trip to talk to her.

“Ellie, are you settling in okay?”

“Yes,” she nodded obediently.

I wanted to run my hand through her hair but stopped myself, noticing how coarse and split the ends were.

“Dad pulled some strings, and the papers are rushed. You and Savannah will start school together tomorrow.”

“The private school curriculum is different, and the pace is faster, so Mom hired a tutor for you.”

“If you need anything at all, just tell me. Your brother is always here for you.”

Elena nodded sincerely. “Thank you.”

My gaze drifted to the utility room in the backyard. “Is the little dog special?”

Elena glanced at me shyly and explained, “His name is Gus. He was always with me.”

“When I was completely broke, he wandered into a diner. The owner thought he was cute, gave me a meal, and let me stay to wash dishes.”

“He’s my family.”

My heart felt heavy. If she hadn’t been lost, she would be as confident and bright as Savannah. How could she have been left to starve and freeze? I wanted to console her, but looking at her thick frame, I suddenly couldn’t find the words.

Savannah’s voice echoed in my ear. Someone who was truly suffering—would they be that heavy?

From that day on.

Dad went back to his normal work schedule, and I continued my internship at the company. Mom attended her regular society luncheons, dividing her time to care for us all.

Elena and Savannah took the same car to and from school. Savannah was openly solicitous of Elena, always deferring to her. She’d help her with missed homework packets, wait for her after school, and put her favorite dishes on her plate at dinner.

But Elena never returned the kindness. She never touched the food Savannah served her. She would constantly come home late, claiming someone had blocked her, locked her in the bathroom, or mocked her. She even said Savannah had deliberately hidden a test paper.

I didn’t believe Savannah would bully her, but I worried about Elena being a target. Mom and Dad consulted the teachers, who confirmed nothing of the sort had happened. I picked Elena up a few times myself. Each time, her classmates were nothing but friendly.

It was Elena who seemed like a porcupine—isolated, irritable, and quick to anger.

We reluctantly held a small family meeting.

Dad looked at Elena with disappointment. “Ellie, why did you lie?”

“I didn’t lie.”

Elena was frantic, sweat beading on her round, slick face, her fringe sticking together in strands. I felt a twinge of mild disgust. I turned to look at the clean, composed Savannah, and my eyes felt better.

“They knew you were coming to pick me up, so they pretended to be nice!”

“Are you saying Savannah alerted them? And the teachers are covering for them?”

Elena stubbornly thrust out her neck, admitting it by silence.

Savannah trembled, biting her lip, swallowing her pride. “If Sister says so, then it must be true. I apologize, I’m sorry.”

A surge of anger rose in me. Since Elena came back, Savannah had been nothing but warm, only to be met with constant coldness. My cherished little sister—why should she be unhappy because of her?

Mom was heartbroken. “You’re such a good kid, Savannah. What if she keeps bullying you?”

She looked at Elena, her face hardening. “Ellie, we’ve indulged you because you suffered for over a decade. We understand you want family love and attention.”

“But there’s a limit to how spoiled you can be. No well-raised child would slander her sister out of jealousy.”

“We’ll let this slide, but I expect you to change. Don’t act like those bad kids.”

Mom and Dad didn’t want Savannah to be sad, so they took her to an amusement park and asked me to drive.

When I came back down with the car keys, the living room was empty except for Elena, sitting alone, clutching her stomach. She seemed to be in pain.

“Leo, do you believe me?”

I didn’t turn around. “Ellie, senior year is important. Focus on your studies.”

“We treat you and Savannah exactly the same. Don’t overthink things, and don’t make trouble.”

I couldn’t indulge her anymore; she had to learn. I hardened my heart and strode out, faintly hearing a choked gasp.

Elena did change.

She stopped accusing Savannah. When she came home late, she only said she was studying. She spent more time with Gus in the garden. Dad decided it was unfair for Savannah to have to wait for her every day, so he hired another driver.

A week passed smoothly.

But Mom and Dad weren’t happy. Thanks to Elena’s resemblance to Mom, when they met neighbors, everyone was shocked that the biological daughter of the Sullivans looked the way she did. No self-control, no grace, no style, timid and silent. She was leagues behind the poised and elegant Savannah.

Mom was subtly mocked a few times and felt humiliated. She complained to us privately. “I wish Savannah were my real daughter.”

I saw a shadow flicker outside the door but said nothing.

Elena started dieting. She ate only one small meal a day, always boiled vegetables. She often stared blankly at Savannah.

Savannah was surprised. “Sister, do you want to be as thin as me? But I was born this way; I can eat anything and not gain weight.”

Mom didn’t stop Elena’s diet; she even gave her advice on losing weight. But I saw Elena drag her exhausted body back from school every night, and I hesitated.

“Maybe take a break, Ellie. High school students need nutrition for all the studying.”

Her dark, deep-set eyes looked up at me. “Isn’t this what you wanted, Leo?”

I was suddenly speechless.

…

Elena’s weight loss made no progress; she was even heavier, and her health was visibly worse. Standing next to Mom, she looked like an older, worn-out helper. Her face was sallow, and she kept to herself, knowing her place.

To try and please us, she started getting up early to make breakfast.

Mom and Dad didn’t touch it, saying it wasn’t hygienic to mix dough without gloves. Mom complained that she had no concept of ‘luxury’ or ‘quality.’ Elena looked deflated and stopped.

The high-end gated community always held an annual Owners’ Gala. It was a chance to network and scout business opportunities, and our family attended every year. This year, because of a rainy July, it was set for August.

Mom often dragged Savannah along to pick out dresses. She kept choosing, but nothing felt special enough. She wanted bespoke, vintage-inspired gowns and suits. The tailor’s schedule was booked for over a month.

When Mom sighed in frustration, Elena spoke up hesitantly. “Mom, I can make them.”

Mom was skeptical.

“My… my foster mother was a tailor. I learned from her since I was little. I can make gowns.”

Mom gave a strange little laugh. “Fine. You make them, then. The whole family is counting on you.”

Afterward, Mom complained to me bitterly. “Her personality is bad enough, now she’s a liar, too. Let’s see how she gets out of this one.”

I knew Mom just wanted to teach her a lesson. I did, too. Her opportunistic character would lead to trouble later. Better for us to correct her now than for society to beat her down.

But Elena was more serious than we imagined. She took measurements, bought sewing tools, and the best fabric she could afford. Except for tutoring and walking Gus, she locked herself in her room, sewing day and night.

Several times, she was found asleep, clutching her stomach and slumped over the sewing machine. There were pain pills nearby. Probably her period, I thought. I told the housekeeper to take up some ginger tea.

The night before the Gala, her hands dotted with tiny needle pricks, she presented two gowns and two suits. Her eyes were bright, full of expectation.

“Mom, they’re finished.”

There was a moment of stunned silence.

Mom took them, her expression complex. “You actually… well, thank you.”

Elena twisted her fingers, her voice surprisingly light. “As long as you like them, Mom.”

I noticed the count was wrong. “Why are there only four? What about yours?”

Elena clutched the hem of the suit, lowering her gaze. “…I didn’t have time. You all go, I’ll stay home to study.”

Mom looked relieved, yet regretful. “That’s right, your test scores last semester weren’t great. You should focus on your work.”

Elena nodded obediently and returned to her studies.

I watched her retreating back, lost in thought for a long moment.

I’d seen it. The fifth outfit was done, a matching family set. The neckline embroidered with cherry blossoms.

But, her not going was the better choice. It was always painful to be mocked.

The next day, Mom gave us the clothes.

But they weren’t the ones Elena made.

“I didn’t even look at them. She’s so young; what quality could she produce?”

“Everyone at the Gala wears custom designer items. How could I possibly wear something from an unknown source?”

Mom sighed, her voice low. “It’s her fault, too. She couldn’t read between the lines, forcing me to be the villain and turn her down.”

Savannah twirled in the gauze dress she was wearing, doing a graceful little dance. “Mom, my taste is good, right? I told you, you get what you pay for. You have to spend money for true luxury.”

Dad and Mom praised her. I was also cheered by her lighthearted spirit.

As a family, we headed to the Gala.

I glanced back once, seeing a lone figure slumped by the upstairs window, a collar embroidered with cherry blossoms just visible. I flashed on her sleepless, dark-circled eyes, and felt a brief moment of unsettling guilt.

Savannah sweetly took my arm. “Leo, why don’t we invite Sister? Other people’s opinions don’t matter, family unity is what’s important.”

“No need. She said she didn’t want to go. You’re too kind, Savannah.”

That day, we posted a nine-photo grid on social media.

Elena did not like the post.

Mom laughed, calling her petty.

Elena spent even more time locked in her room studying. Savannah, however, was always dressed up and going out. She’d sometimes laugh out loud while looking at her phone at the dinner table. She also started asking for more money. We always gave it to her—girls in her social circle had to keep up appearances.

She went on a half-month trip with her friends. Mom and Dad missed her terribly. When they tried to video call, she hung up impatiently, saying she was busy.

I laughed, comforting my disappointed parents. “It’s your fault for spoiling her, she’s always been dramatic.”

Mom glared at me. “You haven’t exactly held back on spoiling her either.”

Savannah lowered her head, quietly eating her rice.

Summer flew by.

Just before school started, Savannah sought out Mom, Dad, and me, her face grave.

“Dad, Mom, Leo, Ellie is my sister. I’ve thought hard, and I can’t cover for her anymore.”

Her eyes darted around the room.

“Yesterday, I went with my friend to a clinic for a routine checkup, and I saw Sister going into the Women’s Health department…”
