"Kylie, once Charlotte finishes her rehab this month, I'll break up with her. Just wait a little longer, alright?" Charlotte pushed open the door of the private room just in time to hear Sean making that promise.

He continued, "You know I owe her a lot. I only made it through school because she fought underground matches to pay for it. 

"Now that I'm finally the head of neurosurgery, since she hasn't had much of a good life yet, once her leg's healed, I'll give her some money. That should more or less settle the debt."

His voice carried a tone of relief, as if he could finally breathe again. However, Charlotte's hand froze on the door.

Three months ago, Sean had found the most renowned orthopedic specialist in the country for her. When the doctor guaranteed that her leg could fully recover, his eyes shone with hope like stars.

Charlotte had foolishly thought that he wanted to start over with her, that he finally remembered the good between them and was ready to commit again.

While she was still dazed, Kylie Lundberg's soft voice trembled from inside, full of joy and promise. "Okay, I'll wait for you. I knew you loved me."

After that, the sound of an embrace and the faint noise of lips meeting could be heard.

Charlotte couldn't listen any longer. Her entire body went cold, as if the blood in her veins had frozen. She nearly collapsed, if not for a passing waiter who caught her. "Miss, are you heading in?"

Charlotte snapped back to reality, shaking her head in panic. "Sorry, I went to the wrong room. I'll leave now."

As soon as the words left her mouth, Charlotte turned and ran. Her chest felt like something heavy had struck it, stealing the air from her lungs.

"Sean," she whispered, the name rolling off her lips again and again until every memory she'd buried rose to the surface.

She was five when she first met him at the orphanage. He was a small boy curled up in the corner, his eyes wet with fear. He looked beautiful but timid.

She kneeled beside him and pat her chest confiedently. "Don't be scared. I'll look after you."

Because of that one childish promise, Charlotte protected Sean for 20 years. 

When they fought over food, she was the first to step up, always putting whatever she won into his hands. 

When the college entrance results came out, she tore up her own acceptance letter just to work and help pay his tuition. When street thugs came looking for trouble, she shielded him with her own body.

Through all these years and all his "thank-yous" and "sorrys," she stayed by his side until the day he became the top protégé of the country's leading neurosurgeon and gave her his solemn promise. "Charlotte, our future will be bright."

For a while, it was. 

Sean earned his master's and doctorate, became the youngest neurosurgery director in Joonga's Alphaeus Hospital, and had a bright career ahead. They traded their small rental for a riverside apartment, drove their own car, and filled the closet with new clothes.

He was busy, but he still made time to take her out for shopping, dinner, and small trips. She thought that was how the rest of her life would be peaceful and happy, which was enough.

Until she first heard the name Kylie. 

That night, Sean came home drunk, his shirt collar carrying a faint scent of unfamiliar perfume. One of his colleagues had joked, "Better keep an eye on him, Charlotte. The new intern from overseas insisted on toasting him…"

Charlotte hadn't thought much of it, simply wiping his face. After all, Kylie was their mentor's daughter, so it was natural for him to entertain her.

However, the second time Charlotte heard that name was in bed. His lips were hot against her skin, but the name he murmured was "Kylie".

In that instant, she felt herself fall into an icy abyss.

After that, he tried to make up for it, saying he was just overworked, that it was nothing more than professional respect. 

Charlotte forced herself to believe it. Pretended not to see their late-night messages, the hidden gifts, and the increasing "extra hours" he worked.

However, now, she couldn't pretend anymore.

When she finally stopped running and found an empty hallway, the sobs tore out of her, raw and violent. She didn't know how long she had cried before she could breathe again.

Eventually, she straightened up and walked into another private room. A man was already waiting. He was the owner of a boxing club.

Two weeks ago, when Charlotte's leg had healed enough, she had secretly gone to a gym to train. 

He had been there, watching. Afterward, he handed her his card and asked if she wanted to train professionally, saying that she had real potential to go professional.

Going professional had once been her dream. However, Sean hadn't liked it, so she rejected him without a second thought.

The man had left his card, and this was their rescheduled meeting.

After walking into the wrong room and hearing the truth, she realized everything she had believed in was nothing but her own wishful thinking. If Sean no longer wanted her, she had no reason to stay.

She cleared the fatigue and hoarseness from her voice, took the contract in both hands, and said, "I'll join your club next month."
