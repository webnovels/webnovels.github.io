I had been with Lucas for ten years.
I tattooed his favorite jasmine flower on my collarbone.
He finally agreed to marry me, but he was keeping an 18-year-old girl on the side.
Before the wedding, he indulged in a countdown to breaking up with her.
He went bungee jumping with her, skiing, and watching the Northern Lights in Iceland.
But he didn't know that I didn't have much time left.
I booked a flight to leave the country, donated all his assets, and removed the tattoo.
While he was counting down the days to our wedding, I was planning my escape from him.
