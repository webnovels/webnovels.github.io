Understanding the situation, the officer sternly told Liam, "Sir, move your car immediately."
Liam tried to argue, pointing at us, "Officer, they're scamming me, saying the kid's allergic. It's just a cold, they're wasting medical resources."
The officer frowned, then looked at me.
With tears streaming down my face, I pleaded, "Officer, please believe us. My daughter's in critical condition. It's urgent."
Realizing the gravity, the officer ignored Liam's nonsense.
He commanded other officers to tow the Audi from the emergency lane.
Liam was taken away for obstructing traffic.
Finally, we sped to the hospital.
But upon arrival, I received devastating news.
The allergy emergency equipment was under maintenance and unavailable.
This sudden news hit me like a bolt from the blue, plunging me into despair.
This didn't happen before.
Ethan must have had a hand in this.
He's one of the hospital's investors.
"How can this be? What about my daughter? She can't wait!" Desperate, I clung to the doctor's arm, voice breaking with tears.
The doctor was anxious, "I... there's nothing I can do."
I felt like I was falling into the deepest pit of hell.
I rushed to the hospital, only to be met with devastating news.
The hospital's emergency allergy equipment was undergoing a comprehensive inspection and was currently out of service.
This news struck me like a lightning bolt, plunging me back into a pit of despair.
This never happened in my past life.
Ethan must be behind this; he's one of the hospital's investors.
"How could this happen? What about my daughter? She can't wait!" I cried out, grabbing the doctor's arm in desperation, my voice cracking with tears.
The doctor was just as anxious, "I... I don't have a solution."
It felt like I was suddenly trapped in a living nightmare.
The doctor continued, worried, "We can try some basic medications to start an initial anti-allergy treatment for the child to ease her symptoms, but it's just a temporary fix. Her condition is still very critical."
I looked at my daughter, unconscious on the hospital bed, her breathing shallow. Heart heavy with worry, I nodded in agreement.
The doctors quickly got to work, frantically attending to my daughter.
During this time, I made an urgent call to the relevant authorities.
To make them take it seriously, I falsely claimed that the hospital was withholding the allergy rescue equipment deliberately because I had offended them.
The department took immediate action, promising a swift investigation and a prompt response.
Upon hearing this, I finally felt a glimmer of hope.
Time crawled by, each second feeling like an eternity.
Suddenly, my phone rang.
It was Ethan.
"How does it feel to be played for a fool?"
"Why are you doing this? You know our daughter has allergies."
Ethan's low laugh echoed with malice, like a devil's whisper.
"So what? She's a bastard. Don't think I don't know she's not my child."
I was stunned.
I had gone through so much to have this child through IVF, and he'd never believed she was his.
No wonder he was so ruthless to me and our daughter in our past life.
I pleaded in despair, "She is your daughter. Save her!"
"Shut up, you witch. My sister secretly did a paternity test. That little bastard and I have no relation."
His sister, always his sister.
Does she hate me and my daughter that much?
Tears streamed down my face, a mix of anger and despair.
"Ethan, do you really trust your sister that much?"
"I only trust evidence. How can a paternity test be wrong? You and your bastard daughter can fend for yourselves!"
He hung up.
I collapsed to the ground, overwhelmed by sorrow.
Just then, the doctor rushed out from the emergency room.
The doctor looked serious, "The child's situation is very critical. If we still don't have the allergy emergency equipment, she might..."
The doctor didn't finish, but I understood what he meant.
As I was sinking into despair, my phone rang again.
