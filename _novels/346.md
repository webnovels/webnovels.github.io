"Liam and I were reborn at the same time.

In our past life, we were inseparable, loving each other until we were old and gray.

This time around, I was eagerly anticipating him proposing to me just like he did before.

But instead, he hired a hypnotist to erase my memories, and then he turned around and married my half-sister, Brittany.

“Madison, in the last life, Brittany was married off to a foreign country where she suffered terribly and died. I don't want her to go through that again, so I have to marry her.”

“I don’t want to hurt you, so after the hypnosis, you’ll forget about me. Once I help Brittany out of danger, I’ll find the hypnotist to restore your memories. Then I’ll divorce her and marry you in style.”

Seeing that his mind was made up, I didn't hesitate and agreed to the hypnosis.

He didn't know that once this hypnosis began, the memories couldn't be recovered at all.

In five days, I would completely forget him."
