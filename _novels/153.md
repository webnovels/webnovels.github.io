To have a child before my half-sister and legitimately inherit the family fortune, I selected three potential heirs.

I invested in their companies and helped them prove their worth. I even went out of my way to please Zachary, all in hopes of marrying him.

But Zachary always avoided me, yet knelt before my half-sister, professing his love: "You're the true heir, my wife. If you're not ready to accept me, I'll pretend to marry her and help you reclaim what's rightfully yours."

My father accused me of being fickle, asking which one I'd finally choose.

Remembering Zachary's humiliated look, I casually pointed at the most dazzling man under the spotlight and said, "That male model looks good. I'll take him."
