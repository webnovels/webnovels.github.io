I didn't sleep well. The various things the malicious supporting character Phoebe did in the novel replayed crazily in my mind.

Phoebe bullied the female lead with her group, hired thugs to humiliate the female lead, and used her family background to oppress the female lead, and so on…

In the dream, Phoebe suddenly turned back, with a face identical to mine.

That face was twisted and ferocious, even I found it terrifying. In dreams, time flies, the male lead and the second male lead quickly grow and then take revenge on me.

Declan's cold, indifferent eyes calmly stared at me, as if looking at a dead object.

"Since you like ruining others' innocence, go experience it yourself."

In despair, I was humiliated to death and discarded by a filthy garbage pile, dying in agony.

"No!" I shouted, waking myself up! I looked up into Declan's concerned eyes, overlapping with the brutal and fierce image in the dream, and I trembled in fright. Declan was covering me with a blanket, looking confused. "Honey, what's wrong? Why are you sleeping on the sofa, you'll catch a cold."

"Honey, are you mad at me for drinking too much last night? Sorry, the client was important." I shook my head, engulfed in fatigue and fear, not wanting to say anything.

There's no guest room in our house. Declan once promised he would never make me mad enough to send him to sleep in a guest room.

Even if he did upset me, he'd be sensible enough to sleep on the floor beside me. But when conflicts really arose, I didn't even have a space of my own.

I was indeed under his watchful eye.

Declan didn't notice anything unusual about me, frowning pitifully.

"Honey, I had a tough time at the business dinner yesterday, my head hurts a lot, where's the hangover soup?" "I forgot."

I didn't make any at all. Declan's family isn't wealthy, while I'm a typical rich second generation.

He always said he wanted to earn my father's approval through his own efforts, to achieve more to deserve me. So Declan worked hard. He didn't accept help from the Aiden family, choosing to start his own business.

In the early years, to secure projects, he drank heavily with partners, almost getting a stomach ulcer.

I loved Declan deeply, and as his wife, I always took care of him personally.

For the sake of his health, I found many remedies and often stayed up all night to help him recover from hangovers. If I were unaware of his true feelings, I might have continued being a dutiful wife. However, in reality, my efforts were all one-sided.

[Phoebe used her family background to harm Cora, I can't let her have any chance to harm Cora.

I must achieve success in the business world, have enough power to rival Phoebe's old man.

If they harm Cora like the last life, I'll make the Phoebe family pay a painful price!] Declan's desperate efforts were merely to gain real power, to protect his true love.
