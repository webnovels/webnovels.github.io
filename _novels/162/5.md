"Honey, what's wrong today? You don't look well. Are you feeling unwell? Let me take you to the hospital."

I stared blankly at the man before me, wondering how much sincerity was in his concern.

I hesitated about confronting Declan when suddenly my phone rang. The caller ID showed two big words—Cora.

Declan quickly picked up the phone and handed it to me, signaling with his eyes, "Take it."

I numbly pressed answer, and Cora's cheerful voice came through.

"Phoebe, darling, remember we're going to the art exhibit today?"

"I remember." "Let's meet at the Coffee Shop in front of the Art Gallery, okay? Old Ho is dropping me off on his way to work."

"Okay."

Before I could speak, Declan said, "You have plans with Cora today, let me drive you there."

"No need, your office isn't on the way." Declan lovingly touched my cheek. "Silly, driving my wife anywhere is on the way. Go change your clothes!"

Declan went back to the room to freshen up, his back radiating happiness. He's going to see his beloved, of course, he's thrilled.

"Remember."

"Let's meet directly at the Coffee Shop in front of the Art Gallery. He can drop me off on his way to work."

"Alright."

I hung up the phone, and before I could say anything, Declan spoke first, "You have plans with Cora today? Let me take you there."

"No need. Your office is out of the way."

Declan affectionately touched my cheek.

"Silly, taking my wife anywhere is always my pleasure. Go get changed!"

Declan got up to freshen up, his back radiating happiness.

Of course, he's thrilled to see the one he loves.

He seemed to have forgotten that he just mentioned taking me to the hospital because I looked unwell.

In Declan's world, nothing is more important than Cora.

When Declan dropped me off at the Coffee Shop, Cora was happily sipping a Mocha Cookie Crumble Frappuccino.

She naturally handed me a cup of hot milk, greeting me cheerfully.

Declan gently reminded me, "Girls shouldn't drink too many cold beverages.

It's bad for your health and can cause discomfort at certain times. You're not a kid anymore; you should be more careful."

Cora teased with a smile, "Wow, showing off your affection right in front of me."

Declan replied with a smile, "You too, drink less cold stuff!"

So much preamble for a simple reminder to her.

The hot milk in my hand felt uncomfortably warm.

Actually, I don't like cold drinks. His concern was never really for me.

"Got it, got it. You're so naggy. Only Phoebe can put up with you."

Declan chuckled and turned to me, "I'll pick you up for lunch. I remember you saying you wanted to try the new Spanish restaurant in Phoebe City."

Once doubt creeps in, you realize how insincerely his concern is acted.

It wasn't me who wanted to try the Spanish restaurant; it was Cora.

But I was blindly in love, and he played his part well.

Now that the truth is out, I see I was just blinded by my own ignorance.

Cora held me close.

"Okay, okay, you should go. Don't interrupt our girl time."

She pulled me inside, mumbling non-stop.

"Phoebe, I'm so excited for Master Gu's work..."

I instinctively looked back at the man in the distance.

He was watching us with a scrutinizing gaze, but when our eyes met, he quickly hid his emotions.

He put on a performance of deep affection, acting all affectionate.

Declan, aren't you tired?

Certainly!
