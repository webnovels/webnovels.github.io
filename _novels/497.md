I Died. Then I Saw Everything.

The day I died, my boyfriend brought his first love home.

They kissed shamelessly on the sofa I bought, ate the special savory dumplings I’d made, and played on the gaming console I’d given him.

One day, his first love, Celeste, asked curiously, “Where’s Anya?”

Dorian’s voice was calm, “She got into an argument with me a few days ago, then applied for a business trip.”

Oh, he still didn't know I was dead.
