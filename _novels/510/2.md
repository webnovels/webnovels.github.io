Suddenly I felt warmth trickling from my nose. I reached up to touch it - a streak of bright red.

The same pitiful state as my past life...

At least Jack didn't see it.

I spent the whole night processing the emotions of reliving this life.

The next day I went to class with puffy eyes.

Just as the bell rang, Jack slipped into the classroom.

The 20-year-old him wasn't as composed and mature yet.

His fluffy head would often burrow into my arms like a puppy.

But now, we could never go back to that.

My heart ached at the thought.

I was so lost in my thoughts that I didn't even notice someone sit down beside me.

Seeing no reaction from me, the person slammed their backpack loudly on the desk.

I startled, finally turning to look.

Jack's face was scrunched up in annoyance, dark circles under his eyes.

He ignored my gaze, burying his head in his arms like he was sulking.

He quickly fell asleep, his breathing even.

His phone kept buzzing on the desk.

On impulse, I picked up his phone.

I tried my birthday as the passcode.

It worked - he hadn't changed it.

The first thing I saw was his chat with Mia.

All the previous messages had been deleted.

There was just one message from him:

"Are you still mad?"

Mia's messages came flooding in one after another:

"Who told you to sleep in the study last night!"

"You said you were over Lucy!"

"You promised me! Don't blame me if I change my mind!"

My hands trembled uncontrollably.

I couldn't help remembering countless nights in our past life,

When Jack would rush off at Mia's phone call.

Even when I was on my deathbed, Mia only had to tell a small lie,

And Jack abandoned me without hesitation.

Though I had resolved to let go in despair,

My heart still ached unbearably in this moment.

I still couldn't face the reality that he didn't love me.

But life is for living. This time,

I refuse to watch the one I love treat me coldly again.

I refuse to repeat the same mistakes.

When Jack woke up, I was long gone.

I thought avoiding him would keep things peaceful between us.

But I didn't expect to see Jack again so soon in the cafeteria.

Even though I had told myself countless times to let go,

Seeing him again still made me panic for a moment.

In just a few days, the once sunny and cheerful Jack had changed drastically.

He now spent his nights in bars and clubs, reeking of cigarettes and alcohol.

At the moment, he had his arm around Mia, smiling down at her.

He looked like the stereotypical rich playboy.

He let his friends joke crudely:

"Why bother eating here in the cafeteria, Mia? Don't tell me you and Jack are looking for a new place to get frisky!"

Amid the raucous laughter, Mia scolded coyly:

"Don't be silly. I just happened to have class today and wanted a change of scenery with Jack for lunch."

I had my back to them,

But every word stabbed into my heart.

Jack used to hate cafeteria food.

In the past, he only came because I begged him to accompany me.

Now he moved naturally, his arm around Mia as she leaned into him.

He must be very happy now.

This is good. It strengthens my resolve to leave.
