I was woken by Emma's sobs.

When she saw me open my eyes, she cried even harder.

"How could you get sick? Why didn't you tell me earlier? Why didn't you come to the hospital sooner!"

I tried to raise my hand to wipe her tears,

But my body felt like it was on fire. I had no strength to lift my arm.

The hospital room door was suddenly flung open with a bang.

Jack rushed in.

When he saw me lying pale and lifeless in the hospital bed,

All the strength seemed to leave his body. He broke down sobbing.

I lowered my eyes to look at his wretched state.

Just like in our past life - too little, too late.

Why?

Emma thought Jack was faking his deep love after abandoning me.

She got up and started shoving him out.

The commotion attracted a doctor.

Jack was forced out.

My eyelids felt heavy. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath.

My body was already so weak at this point.

Even in this new life, fate hadn't spared me.

I felt like my strength was draining even faster this time.

Before I could rest,

Mia pushed open the door, her face full of disdain.

What a lively day.

She smiled smugly.

"Lucy, did Jack come?"

"Hah, you don't really think he came to see you, do you?"

She waved her wrist.

"My wrist just twinged a little and he insisted on rushing me to the hospital."

I barely opened my eyes, my voice flat:

"You've seen how pathetic I am. Now get out."

She seemed unsatisfied with my response and got angry.

"Stop acting all high and mighty!"

Then she seemed to think of something and sneered:

"Aren't you curious why he obeys my every word?"

I stared at her intently.

I knew she was blatantly flaunting Jack's preference for her,

But I still couldn't help wanting to hear her say it again.

She snorted derisively.

"Aren't you curious why someone as young as you got this disease?"

My brows furrowed. The strange rapid progression of my illness this time had bothered me, but I never thought there was a reason.

Hearing her words sent chills down my spine.

"To tell you the truth, your illness is from drugs I had people put in your dorm water cup. It took time, but finally showed results, hahaha!"

My mind was reeling. But she got more and more excited as she spoke.

"I originally just wanted to teach you a lesson, but Jack felt bad for you! How could he feel bad for you! He clearly likes me! Back then I only joked about dating his friend as a prank! Who told you to show up in the middle!"

Mia was nearly hysterical.

"Don't you deserve to die? Just enjoy... enjoy your last moments alive."

"Oh right, that idiot Jack actually believed me when I said I had medicine that could cure your illness, how hilarious hahaha..."

SLAP!

Emma rushed over and slapped her hard across the face, her eyes blazing red as she roared:

"You murderer! You'll pay for this!"

Mia clutched her face, her expression turning vicious.

"What can I possibly pay for! You bunch of nobodies, what power do you have to make me pay! It's her own fault! She should never have appeared in Jack's life in the first place!"

I finally understood. In both lives,

All my suffering came from Mia's selfish desires.
