"Who do you choose, me or her?"

Mia clung to Jack's arm, dragging her suitcase.

Though phrased as a question, her tone left no room for doubt about the answer she expected.

I stared blankly ahead, muttering,

"The feelings were never that deep anyway. No need to pretend to be heartbroken."

Jack looked up sharply at me.

"What did you say?"

I jolted, meeting his gaze.

His eyes swirled with complex emotions -

Suppressed feelings, reluctance to let go, and the joy of reunion after a long separation.

With just that one look, I knew he had come back too.

I looked at this man who had tormented each other for ten years in our past life.

Fighting the pain in my chest, I opened my trembling lips:

"I said..."

Mia impatiently cut me off.

"God, you're so annoying!"

She stepped forward, jabbing my shoulder with her long, manicured nails.

"Someone like you, apart from your pretty face, is completely ordinary in every other way. Just finish school like a good girl and don't covet what isn't yours."

In the past, I would have argued endlessly with Mia.

But now I knew that no matter what, Jack would always take Mia's side.

Forget it.

Looking past Mia, I saw Jack's pained expression.

She turned and linked her arm through Jack's, her eyes glinting slyly.

"Let's go. My dad is waiting for us. I heard their new drug research is making progress..."

Jack's brow furrowed, then he spoke in a cool voice:

"This kind of life is too cloying. Mia and I rented an apartment near campus. You can come visit sometime if you'd like."

With that, the two of them turned and left.

The 20-year-old Jack was just like the 25-year-old Jack.

For Mia's sake, he abandoned me again without hesitation.

It made sense. Given another chance at life, he surely didn't want to repeat past mistakes.

Tears welled up in my eyes.

Emma beside me mistakenly thought I was crying because of them.

She rolled up her sleeves, ready to chase after them.

I grabbed her sleeve to stop her.

"Let it go, Emma. He's choosing what he wants. There's nothing wrong with that."

Jack turned back at my words.

Though his expression remained calm, his eyes were turbulent,

Full of sorrow and reluctance to part.

I wiped away my tears, avoiding his gaze. I didn't want to read too much into his thoughts.

Then I pulled Emma with me back to the dorm.

Ending our entanglement while there was still a chance to salvage things might not be such a bad thing.

In our past life, to please Mia,

He gave me 100 divorce papers after we married,

Just to satisfy all of Mia's unreasonable demands.

Even in my final moments, one phone call from Mia was enough to draw him away from my hospital bedside.

He simply didn't love me anymore.

I was foolish not to let go until my dying breath.

Heaven took pity and gave us another chance,

But no one asked if I wanted to go through it all again.

I suddenly remembered Jack's last words before he died:

"Lucy, I was wrong. If there's another life, I'll make amends."

But no matter what he meant,

I didn't want to keep tormenting each other anymore.

Lucy, don't soften your heart.

Lucy, don't look back.
