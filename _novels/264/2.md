I didn't even have the strength to confront her. I turned, wanting to leave.
But Noah pointed in my direction, a timid expression on his face.
“It’s… Mr. David… Why is he here? Is he trying to send me away again?”
He nervously clutched Stella’s clothes, as if he was terrified of me.
Stella’s brows furrowed. Her cold, piercing gaze instantly swept over me.
“David, you really don’t give up, do you? You actually followed me to the hospital!”
She ordered her bodyguards to restrain me. I struggled, and blood started to seep from the back of my hand.
Stella saw it and sneered, “Using a pity play now?”
“Yesterday you lied about Chloe being injured by a bomb, today you’re faking your own bleeding. Tell me, what’s next? Are you going to buy an urn next and set up a whole funeral service?”
I sharply raised my head, my eyes burning with intense hatred.
“Stella, do you have any heart?! Chloe is dead! You killed her with that bomb!”
Stella froze, startled by my frantic state. A flicker of hesitation crossed her face.
Noah stepped forward, frowning slightly, and spoke disapprovingly.
“Stella arranged for fake bombs. How could they possibly kill little Chloe? Mr. David, if you’re going to make up a story, at least make it believable.”
“I know you don’t want me near Stella, but you can’t joke about Chloe’s life.”
Stella’s face instantly turned cold.
“David, having a father like you is Chloe’s biggest disgrace!”
I stared at Stella in disbelief. Chloe was dead, and she still thought I was lying.
I wanted to laugh, but tears hit the floor first.
It didn't matter anymore. Chloe was gone. Nothing else mattered.
I got up from the ground, wanting only to find Chloe.
But Stella had her bodyguards firmly pin me to the ground, her words chillingly cruel.
“You will kneel here and reflect. When you realize your mistake, then you can get up.”
She walked away with Noah, leaving me kneeling there, surrounded by the passing crowds.
I tried to stand, but every time I moved, a bodyguard would kick me in the back of the knee.
I crashed onto the floor, blood already seeping from my knees.
I turned, glaring at them.
“Don’t you dare forget who I am. How dare you stop me?!”
The bodyguards were expressionless. “We only follow Ms. Jiang’s orders.”
I was forced to kneel for ten hours. The blood beneath me had already stained the floor crimson, but I stubbornly tried to get up.
When they kicked me again, my body went limp, and I passed out.
The two bodyguards exchanged glances, then called Stella.
“He fainted after only a few hours of kneeling? He must be faking it again. He’s at the hospital, he won’t die. Don’t bother with him.”
When I woke up, I was still lying on the cold floor.
The bodyguards were gone. Ignoring the pain in my knees, I staggered, leaning against the wall, to the morgue.
But when I saw Chloe, there was a gaping hole in her chest.
Her heart had been taken!
