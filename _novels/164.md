My fiancée is pregnant with a male colleague's child, and she's due soon.

When she returned from her business trip, visibly pregnant, I was setting up our wedding room.

I confronted her, my voice raw from disbelief. She looked at me innocently and said, "He just donated sperm. I have nothing to hide from you."

With that, she left with the colleague to pick out a gift for the baby.

I immediately shared the news with the family group chat and called off the wedding.

But everyone thought I was overreacting.

Adeline's mother said, "Adeline is beautiful and well-educated. Her genes deserve to be passed on. It's for the greater good."

Adeline's father added, "She didn't cheat. Why are you making this a big deal?"

My father was so furious he had a heart attack, "You stubborn fool! How could you back out of such a good marriage?"

My mother lamented, "If you call off the wedding, no one will ever marry you!"

With tears, I replied, "Then I won't marry at all!"

Yet someone sent a message: "Jasper, when will you let me step up?"
