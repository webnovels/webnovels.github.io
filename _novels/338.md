"I’m a well-known songwriter in the States, and turns out I’m also the long-lost daughter of the Carter family.

But no matter what track I drop, my stepsister, Ashley Carter, always seems to release something similar first.

Everyone thinks I’m a copycat. Overnight, I became public enemy number one.

Ashley even twisted the truth online, doxxed me, and sicced her fans on me.

Some of her crazed followers sent me death threats, and even worse, they ran over Nana, leaving her in a coma.

To pay for Nana's medical bills, my biological parents strong-armed me into ghostwriting for Ashley, turning her into a musical prodigy.

Finally, after Nana passed, I couldn't take the pressure anymore. I tried to end it all.

This time around, I’ve decided to quit the music scene and just chill.

But my ""genius"" sister and my loaded parents are losing their minds."
