When we got our marriage license, Lucas told me he didn't know how to love, so for five years of marriage, he gave me sex and desire.

It was an arranged marriage, and I knew I couldn't be greedy. I thought that was enough.

Until our anniversary night.

I broke his bedroom rule and secretly removed my blindfold for the first time.

But I accidentally saw the name tattooed on his lower back.

At that moment, I realized.

Lucas wasn't incapable of love; he had just hidden it away, saving it for my sister.

We had a huge fight, wishing each other dead.

Who would have thought those words would come true, as we both died in a car crash off a cliff.

Before dying, Lucas looked at me, his face covered in blood, and begged:

"Aria, if there's a next life, let's not be husband and wife, okay?"

I stared at him, laughing miserably like a madwoman.

When I opened my eyes again, I saw Lucas kneeling with his back straight:

"Uncle, Aunt, I can't marry Aria. I'm in love with Rose."

I was stunned.

But I quickly accepted it. As it happened, I didn't want to choose him this time either.
