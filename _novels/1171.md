There were nine generations of Sandlers, and each had only a single heir to carry the family line.

The latest was Maverick Sandler, the sole descendant of his line. Unfortunately for the family, he had devoted his life entirely to the heavens and was utterly indifferent to women.

Desperate to continue the bloodline, the patriarch of the Sandler family, Alec Sandler, put forth a staggering offer of 100 billion dollars. Whoever could conceive an heir would inherit the Sandlers' entire business empire!

Countless socialites tried their luck, throwing themselves at Maverick one after another. Every single one of them was coldly kicked out of his private meditation room.

Meanwhile, I was dying from a terminal illness when I got bound to the Conception System.

The system said, "Maya Jemison, win over Maverick Sandler. One child will extend your lifespan by ten years. Twins will grant you eternal life. Triplets, and you'll ascend on the spot!"

Staring at Maverick, a man of unshakable faith and ironclad self-control, I clenched my teeth.

I burned my last scrap of life force, trading it for Velvet Allure and a top-tier Succubus Charm through the system. I also got a Perfect Strike card—guaranteed to hit.

Even though I was still a virgin, I had no choice but to force myself on Maverick if I wanted to live.

"Forgive me, Mr. Sandler. Saving a life outweighs any act of devotion.It's said that saving a life is a virtue. Saints are supposed to save the masses. I'm part of the masses, you see, so please save my life!"

That night, the chapel descended into chaos.

When the lofty Maverick fell from his divine pedestal, he lost all restraint and turned feral.

…

The Sandler residence was heavy with the scent of burning candles.

It was the day Maverick officially dedicated his life to the heavens. Every elite family in Velmora was watching with bated breath as the 100-billion-dollar empire stood on the brink of losing its heir.

Alec slumped into his armchair. His hair had turned snow-white overnight.

He slammed his cane against the floor. The sound echoed through the room, yet it didn't make the resolute figure kneeling in prayer budge even an inch.

"Maverick! You're going to be the death of me!"

Dressed in plain clothes, Maverick had a detached expression, as if the world had no hold on him. He rolled the prayer beads in his fingers, speaking in a calm, steady voice. "Grandpa, I'm done with this world. The Sandlers' wealth means nothing to me. There's no need to force it."

"So you're done with this world, are you? How very enlightened of you."

I clenched a crumpled sheet of paper in my fist and barged in.

I didn't have a choice. The system's countdown had only three days left. If I couldn't take down the stubborn so‑called saint, I would be dead from a cancer relapse.

"Who let you in? Get her out of here!"

The woman beside Maverick sprang to her feet. She wore a flowing white dress, and her hair was swept up in a perfect knot. Every inch of her exuded cold pride.

She was Aria Waller, Maverick's spiritual partner. She was the very person who had been twisting his mind day after day, trying to turn him into a devout recluse.

A bodyguard stepped forward, but I slammed my ultrasound report onto the priceless elm table.

"You gonna kick me out?"

I let out a cold laugh and pointed at my stomach. "I want to see anyone who dares touch the Sandler family's three future heirs!"

Alec's cane clattered to the floor.

Even Maverick's usually impassive eyes flickered at last. He whipped his head around, fixing me with his gaze.

Scoffing, Aria walked over and snatched up the report. Without even glancing at it, she tried to tear it to pieces. 

"Who let this crazy woman in? You're just desperate for money, aren't you? Maverick hasn't touched a woman in three years—he's been living a life of discipline! And you're pregnant? What, did you get pregnant out of thin air?"

Quick as lightning, I snatched the report back and shoved her hard. "You're up to no good! You want to destroy the proof of my pregnancy and stop the Sandler family from having an heir!"

Caught off guard, Aria stumbled back a few steps and knocked over a candle. Her pristine white dress was instantly streaked with wax and soot. She looked completely disheveled.

"How dare you push me?" she shrieked, her saintly facade crumbling in an instant.

Ignoring her, I strode toward Maverick. I looked down at the man I had spent an entire night tangled with.

That night, with the system's items in play, he had been anything but calm—or innocent.

"The eighth of last month. The chapel behind Mistveil Church, up on the hill."

I leaned close to his ear, letting the words slip out softly. "The scarlet mark on your back—it changes with your body temperature. Is that proof enough, or do you want me to spell it out?"

His gaze was indifferent a moment ago, but now his pupils contracted sharply. The prayer beads in his hand snapped from their thread, scattering across the floor.

Satisfied with his reaction, I turned to Alec, who was trembling with emotion, and offered my sweetest smile.

"Congratulations, Alec. The Sandler family has heirs now—and what's more, it's triplets."
