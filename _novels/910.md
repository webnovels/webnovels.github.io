Roxanne O'Brien was the youngest chief engineer at the Aerospace Research Institute, yet she chose to keep her identity hidden and lived quietly as Callum Moreno's devoted wife for three years.

Callum was unaware that the National Meritorious Scientist, Chief O'Brien, whom he saw on the news every day, was the same woman who cooked his meals at home. Day after day, she cooked for him and brought food for his entire unit.

Everyone praised her as the model military wife.

Roxanne thought their life together would always be this peaceful—until the day she brought Callum lunch. She happened to overhear his comrade teasing him, "I can't believe you still carry Zoey's picture in your wallet, Callum. 

"It's been years since you broke up. Have you not gotten over her yet?"

Her heart sank, as if an invisible hand had gripped it tightly. 

Callum's cool, low voice followed. "Yeah." 

That one word pierced her chest like an ice pick.

His comrade sounded indignant for her. "No offense, but Roxanne's been so good to you. I mean, she took care of you all these years without a single complaint. You mean to tell me… you've never once felt anything for her?" 

A brief silence hung in the air before Callum's calm yet cruel voice sounded again. "I was never drawn to a virtuous wife who does nothing but cook and clean. The kind of woman I admire is someone like Zoey—brilliant, capable, and someone who can be my equal. If my mother hadn't fallen gravely ill and begged to see me married before she passed, I would never have married Roxanne."

As soon as his words fell, her lunch container hit the ground with a heavy thud. Hot soup spilled everywhere, steam rising in a thick cloud, startling the people inside.

The door swung open. Callum stood tall in the doorway in his neatly pressed uniform. When he spotted Roxanne outside, her face pale and stricken, his forehead creased. "What are you doing here?"

The sight of his handsome yet indifferent face made her feel like her heart was being ripped into shreds. The pain was so intense that it made it hard for her to breathe.

All of a sudden, she remembered the fire that had broken out in their home days ago. He had dashed into the flames like a madman and emerged with a worn-out wallet. 

At the time, Roxanne had foolishly thought it must have contained some important military document or keepsake. Now, she knew the only thing he had treasured inside was Zoey Freeman's photo. And she, his wife who had lived with him all these years, mattered less to him than a single photograph.

The realization was both absurd and devastating. 

Roxanne realized she had been nothing but a joke.

She didn't answer his question, nor did she take in the awkward looks on his comrades' faces. She merely gave him one hollow, despairing look before spinning around and staggering away. 

Roxanne went straight to the Judge Advocate General's Corps and filed for a contested divorce. Then, she returned to the cold, empty house and dialed a number that had long been buried in her memories. 

The call was answered almost instantly, and an excited, disbelieving voice came from the other end of the line. "Chief O'Brien? Is it really you? You're finally reaching out to us again!"

Roxanne closed her eyes and took a deep breath. When she reopened them, only a quiet resolve remained. "It's me. I wish to return to the institute."

"That's wonderful!" The person on the other end almost leaped for joy. "Chief O'Brien, ever since you left, our rocket research has been at a standstill! 

"Right now, the higher-ups are setting up a panel of specialists for Project SkyDome. The team will be sent to the northwest base to conduct top-secret research in complete isolation from the outside world for a minimum of five years.

"We urgently need someone who can really take charge. If you come back, the position of chief will unquestionably be yours! With you, our nation's cutting-edge defense will surely make a breakthrough. So… are you willing to take this on?"

Project SkyDome… Five years of isolation… 

"Sure," Roxanne responded without the slightest hint of hesitation. "Count me in!" 

"Excellent!" chirped the person on the other end. "Before setting out, the institute will host a grand farewell ceremony for you and the panel of specialists. As the leader, you'll have to take the stage and give a speech. Numerous senior officials and fellow researchers will be in attendance. 

"Chief O'Brien, what happened back then really wasn't your fault. Sacrifice is inevitable in this line of work. Mr. Chapman… must've made that choice of his own free will."

"Yeah," she responded quietly before hanging up the phone. 

Her gaze landed on the wedding photo on the wall. In it, Callum's expression was cold and stern. He didn't even smile on their wedding day, whilst she leaned against him with a bright smile, almost as if she had the whole world in her arms.

Memories surged back like a tide.

Three years ago, she had been the youngest researcher at the Aerospace Research Institute, hailed as a prodigy in rocket engine design. However, a single miscalculation in her data had caused the test chamber to explode.

Her mentor, Theo Chapman, had shielded her with his own body, taking the hit from the flying debris. Before he died, he had held her hand and said, "Roxanne, you were born for aerospace. Don't abandon your gift because of me…"

Yet, she had never been able to forgive herself. 

One stormy night, Roxanne had walked to the river behind the institute, ready to end it all. She had been about to sink when a pair of strong arms pulled her out.

Callum, drenched to the bone, frowned as he said, "There's nothing you can't get past. As long as you're alive, there's hope!"

At that moment, he felt like the only beam of light in her dark world. 

So, she hid her identity and found a way into his life. When she learned of his mother's illness and dying wish, she offered to be his wife. 

However, after the wedding, she found out that Callum's heart had already been taken. Even as he lay with her, the name on his lips had always been Zoey.

She had foolishly believed that if she showered him with enough love and warmth, she would one day win his heart. Now, she knew that she could never enter it because he had never made room for her there.

In that case, it was best to go their separate ways and set each other free. He could return to his first love, and she would continue with her mission, toward the endless stars and vast skies.

That night, Callum never came home. 

…

The next morning, Roxanne was quietly packing her things when she heard the front door open and voices in the entryway. She stepped out of her room and found Callum walking in with a young woman.

The woman was elegant and well-dressed, her makeup flawless. Roxanne recognized her instantly—she was the same woman from the photo in Callum's wallet, Zoey.

It felt as if her heart had been pricked by a thousand needles again, the pain spreading in thin, unending waves. Not only had he longed for Zoey all this time, but he had actually brought her into their home. 

Callum noticed Roxanne and introduced calmly, "This is Zoey. She's a friend of mine who just came back from abroad. She hasn't found a place to stay yet, so she'll be staying with us for a while."

He didn't even ask Roxanne for her opinion. He merely informed her and led Zoey toward the guest room. "How long are you planning to stay this time?"

Zoey's voice was gentle and amiable. "I'll probably be staying for good. I was fortunate enough to join the Aerospace Research Institute No. 2. I'm just an intern who is still on probation, but I heard the institute has just launched Project SkyDome, a program open only to the very best specialists. 

"They'll be heading to the base for five years of closed research, and the institute's holding a grand farewell ceremony for them. The project leader is said to be a legend in this field, and she'll be giving a speech at the ceremony… I wish I could meet her. I wonder when I'll be as remarkable as she is…"
