My younger sister, who is in college, got pregnant out of wedlock. When asked about the father's identity, she refused to disclose it, insisting on having the child as a testament to their love. I felt sorry for her because she was so young and pregnant, so I brought her home and took good care of her.

Only on the day she was about to give birth did she tearfully admit in front of everyone that the child was hers and my husband's.

After a huge uproar, it turned out my whole family saw me as nothing but a free nanny.
