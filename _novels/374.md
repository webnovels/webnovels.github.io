I’m an embalmer, always dealing with the dead. But now, I’m battling a living ghost for my husband’s heart.

My husband, Julian Sterling, fell in love with a dead woman.

He’d make me breakfast in the morning and hold me in his arms at night, gently whispering ‘Harper.’ But I knew all his tenderness was separated by a chilling layer of ice. Because his heart had been buried with Eleanor, the love of his life, three years ago.

Then I got pregnant. I held the pregnancy test results, hoping this baby could finally break through the ice between us. But Eleanor’s sister, Chloe Reed, threw a scalding hot liquid onto my stomach.

“My brother-in-law said he’d never touch any woman but my sister.”

Her smile twisted into something cruel. “Harper, your husband said he never touched you.”

“Now tell me, whose bastard child is that?”
