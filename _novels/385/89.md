%... 95%... 98%...

Just as the progress bar was about to reach 100%, I pressed the pause button.

*Ding—*

With a crisp chime, the entire synthesis process stopped.

Dorian Blackwood froze: “Seraphina? Why did it stop?”

I turned around, the smile completely gone from my face: “Oh, I forgot something.”

“The key to initiating the final synthesis is my heartbeat.”

“And right now, I’m-not-in-the-mood.”

Eleanor Vance’s eyes widened, staring at me in disbelief: “You… you’re joking, right?”

“Joking? Like you two joked with my life?”

The immense chasm between hope and despair instantly shattered Eleanor Vance.

She opened her mouth, trying to say something, but couldn't draw another breath.

Her eyes wide, she simply breathed her last.

“Eleanor! Eleanor!” Dorian Blackwood clutched her lifeless body, letting out a raw scream.

Consumed by loss and rage, he violently ripped open his collar, revealing a miniature bomb detonator: “Seraphina! I’ll make you die with her!”

“Let’s die together!”

The moment he pressed the button—

All the lights and power in the entire base flickered out.

Darkness consumed everything.

Only a soft blue light, emanating from my chest, illuminated my face.

It was the glow from my heart rate monitor.

“Forgot to tell you,” my voice echoed in the darkness. “The lab’s highest authority isn’t electricity, it’s not software.”

“Your detonator signal can’t get out.”

“It’s my heartbeat.”

“Here, I am a god.”
