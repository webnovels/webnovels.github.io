I looked at the fragments on the floor, the remnants of my entire youth.

The last bit of bitterness in my heart vanished.

These things, I didn’t need them anyway.

As I was about to leave with my few belongings, Chloe Davis grabbed my arm.

“Since you’re no longer part of the Knight family, shouldn’t you leave all of Mason’s things behind?”

“Mason, isn’t that right?”

I looked at the two of them standing side-by-side behind me. Chloe Davis’s face was smug with petty triumph, and Mason Knight, without waiting for me to speak, immediately defended her.

“Chloe’s right. Our family’s things, you should leave them.”

Their shamelessness made me laugh, a bitter, sarcastic sound. 

It was true, the clothes I was wearing had all been bought by Mrs. Knight.

“Mason Knight, what exactly do you want me to leave behind? Are you suggesting I strip naked and walk out of Stellar Entertainment today?”

Mr. Knight, who had rushed over, slapped Mason across the face.

“You insolent fool! Even if Scarlett isn’t your wife, she’s still your sister. Is this how you treat her?!”

I saw the disgust in Mason Knight’s eyes as he looked at me, and I suddenly smiled.

“Mr. Knight, they’re right. We should settle things.”

I slowly raised my hand, pointing at Mason Knight from head to toe.

“This watch on your wrist? I bought it for you with my first bonus, remember? You said you loved it.”

“The cufflinks on your shirt? I specifically tracked them down for you when I was on exchange in Germany. A global limited edition.”

“And this necklace on your chest? I ran to every counter in the city to find this specific color for you.”

“From head to toe, which one of these items wasn’t bought with my own salary?”

Mason Knight’s face instantly darkened. He clenched his jaw.

He actually started unbuttoning his shirt, taking off his watch, and removing his necklace, throwing them all on the floor.

Seeing this, Chloe Davis immediately pointed at me triumphantly: “Then what about your things? Shouldn’t they be returned to the Knight family too? This dress, those earrings, and the ring on your finger—which of them wasn’t bought with the Knight family’s money?”

I ignored her taunts, not even bothering to look down at those items.

My gaze remained fixed on Mason Knight, my voice calm yet heavy with unspoken power.

“Three years ago, with the New Century Artist contract termination case, I endured immense pressure, working ten sleepless days to piece together the artist’s identity from a pile of terminated contracts, ensuring he could continue his career. That’s how Mr. Knight was exceptionally promoted to his current position as CEO.”

“Two years ago, if I hadn’t returned from my business trip early, Mrs. Knight would have… from carbon monoxide poisoning.”

I took a step forward, meeting his gaze directly.

“Mason Knight, I saved your mother’s career. I helped expand your father’s business empire. How do you intend to repay those debts?”

“Now, do you still want me to take off these so-called ‘Knight family possessions’?”

Mason Knight was visibly cornered by my questions. His eyes darted away, unable to meet my gaze. After a long silence, he finally squeezed out a reply through gritted teeth:

“That’s a separate issue.”

I burst out laughing, laughing at the Knight family’s so-called kindness, laughing at my own foolishness in the previous life.

From this day forward, I was done with the Knight family, a clean break, no more ties.

Chloe Davis saw that Mason Knight was speechless because of me and immediately jumped in to defend him: “Scarlett Hayes, stop with your manipulative words! Take off the Knight family’s clothes immediately!”

One by one, I began to remove my necklace, earrings, and bracelet. 

They hit the floor with crisp clinks, just like my once-shattered heart.

All my clothes were neatly placed on my workstation.

 I changed into my faded, yellowed old work uniform.

I thought two lives would have made me strong enough.

But looking at his familiar face, the tears still flowed without my permission.

I wiped my tears, turning my back and walking towards the door without a second glance.

As soon as I stepped out, the whispers of those around me reached my ears:

“I heard Producer Hayes wasn’t just resigning, she was fired.”

“Tsk, tsk, for a chief producer to fall this low.”

“Mr. Knight’s son is ruthless enough to turn on his childhood sweetheart.”

My steps faltered slightly, but I didn’t stop.

Just as I was about to walk out of Stellar Entertainment’s main entrance, Mason Knight’s voice came from behind me:

“Scarlett Hayes.”

I paused, but didn’t turn around.

“I’ve already spoken to everyone. There’s no place in the entire entertainment industry that will let you continue as a producer.”

So, he not only wanted to ruin my reputation but also destroy my future.

How cruel, Mason Knight.

I strode forward, disappearing from his sight.

Turning the corner, I saw a business van. I opened the door and got in.

“Ms. Albright, congratulations on finally getting what you wanted.”

She smiled, turning and taking my hand.

“Scarlett Hayes, it’s a pleasure to work with you.”


I quickly moved to the Capital City, joined Galaxy Music, and was appointed Chief Producer.

Galaxy Music’s office was decorated festively, with a banner that read, “WARMEST WELCOME TO CHIEF PRODUCER SCARLETT HAYES TO GALAXY MUSIC.”
