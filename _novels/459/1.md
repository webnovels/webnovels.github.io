Mr. Knight sat in his office, his expression heavy.

“Mason, for this new album, who should we pick as producer? Scarlett or Chloe?”

Colleagues around us chuckled.

“Is that even a question? Mason and Scarlett are childhood sweethearts! Who else would he pick?”

I had grown up in the Knight family, and they had long since unofficially decided I would be their daughter-in-law. 

The position of producer for this new album was, naturally, assumed to be mine.

But this time, Mason Knight abruptly interrupted his father.

“Dad, let’s keep personal matters separate. Selecting a producer should be fair. I shouldn’t be making that decision.”

It clicked instantly. He had been reborn too.

Since he was so fixated on his unrequited love for Chloe Davis last time, I decided this time, I’d make sure they got their happy ending.

“Mr. Knight, I honestly don’t think my abilities are sufficient. I’m not a good match for Mason, nor do I think I belong in the core production team.”

I grabbed a blank sheet of paper and swiftly wrote out the words, “RESIGNATION LETTER.”

Seeing my actions, Mason Knight didn’t say a word. He just turned and bolted from the office.

At this exact time in my last life, Chloe Davis had been cornered by furious haters who didn't want her signed.

 In the chaos, a deranged hater injured her wrist, making it impossible for her to hold a microphone again.

Now that he had a second chance, he was clearly going to protect Chloe from that fate.

Mr. Knight exploded in fury, pushing my resignation letter back across the desk.

“Scarlett Hayes, what nonsense is this? I taught you everything you know, and now you want to resign?”

Mr. Knight, who had raised me like his own daughter, now looked at me with utter disappointment.

I met his gaze, wanting to explain, but in the end, I simply bowed deeply.

“Mr. Knight, I’m truly sorry. I’ll leave the Knight family. I’ll find a way to repay your kindness in the future.”

“Mason’s heart belongs to someone else. You can’t force love, Mr. Knight. Please, let them be together. Mason and I are simply not meant to be.”

Mr. Knight wanted to argue, but then he remembered the rumors he’d heard about his son and Chloe Davis. He swallowed all his words.

I packed my belongings and moved out of the Knight household for good.

The day I left, Mason Knight stood in the yard, casting a distant glance in my direction.

Twenty years of shared history from our last life had ended here. 

Once I finished handing over my work at Stellar Entertainment, I wouldn’t have to see them again.

News of their signing and engagement spread throughout Stellar Entertainment. Red, eye-catching contracts were laid out on every colleague’s desk.

People in the hallway constantly snuck glances at me, whispering.

Everyone knew I had chased Mason Knight for over a decade, from a shy girl to a seasoned producer. They all thought I’d be the one walking down the aisle.

But I simply gave the gilded contracts a dismissive glance and returned to my composition report.

Chloe Davis often spoke loudly in the recording studio these days, deliberately raising her voice as if afraid no one would hear her.

“Mason bought me another necklace yesterday. He said it’s to match my debut outfit.”

 “He also said once we’re done with promotions, he’ll let me take on bigger projects.”

 I ignored her boasting, focusing intently on my composition report.

Until that day, I overheard Mason Knight and Mr. Knight arguing in the CEO’s office.

“Dad, Chloe should be in charge of the new album. You’ve seen her capabilities.”

Mr. Knight’s voice was displeased: “Mason, Scarlett has been working on this album for a long time. Replacing her now would cause problems. Besides, Chloe just signed; she doesn’t have enough experience.”

Mason Knight was insistent: “But Chloe has her unique talent, she can do this album! Dad, you can’t just favor Scarlett because of personal feelings, can you?”

I clearly remembered that in my previous life, I had used subtle clues in the composition to piece together the album’s entire structure, ultimately producing a city-wide sensation.

Stellar Entertainment earned major accolades because of it, and I became famous overnight with that album.

The title of ‘Top Producer’ echoed through the entertainment industry, and my career skyrocketed.

Mason Knight, having been reborn, surely knew all of this.

 He simply wanted Chloe Davis to gain fame through this project in this life.

With that thought, I pushed open the office door and handed over all my composition documents. “Mr. Knight, here are all the materials and reports.”

Mr. Knight looked at my calm demeanor, his eyes unreadable.

 After much hesitation, he took the reports from my hand.

“Scarlett, it’s Mr. Knight and the Knight family who owe you an apology.”

My voice was calm.

“It’s alright, Mr. Knight. You raised me, so consider this my way of repaying your kindness.” 

Mr. Knight looked up, his eyes filled with guilt.

He had nurtured me like a daughter for many years. But ultimately, I couldn’t compare to his own son. The scales still tipped in Mason Knight’s favor.
