The moment I voluntarily handed over the reports, a flicker of obvious shock crossed Mason Knight’s face.

He probably expected me to argue, maybe even cry hysterically, but I had been surprisingly decisive.

These documents were the result of countless sleepless nights, each page filled with my hard work and professional judgment.

He clearly hadn't expected me to let go so easily.

“Scarlett Hayes, don’t think this reverse psychology will get my attention.” 

Mason Knight quickly regained his cold expression, his tone dripping with disdain. 

“You’ll never measure up to Chloe. You should have realized that a long time ago.”

Right. He always believed in Chloe Davis’s casually mentioned ‘innate musicality.’ To my dying day, I never knew what he’d written in his notebook that made him so certain I’d only succeeded by riding on Chloe Davis’s coattails.

Mason Knight, standing before me, shoved the thick reports into Chloe Davis’s hands.

Chloe took the documents, eager to flip through them, but her face grew increasingly distraught with each page she read.

“Mason, why are there only records of the composition process and no final product?”

She asked, somewhat flustered. I let out a soft laugh, a hint of sarcasm in my voice: “The finished product? That shouldn’t be a problem for Chloe, right? Especially with your unique talent.”

Picking up on the sarcasm, Mason Knight and Chloe Davis both snorted and turned to leave the office.

I watched them go, shaking my head with a smile.

Chloe Davis was nothing but a rookie who had never even done an independent composition. How could she possibly analyze complex clues and draw conclusions?

I was eager to see how Mason Knight would elevate his beloved to fame.

At the new album recording studio, just as I expected, Chloe Davis made a fool of herself in front of everyone. 

“Ms. Davis, could you please hand me the mixer?”

 But Chloe Davis picked up a metronome and handed it to my old partner, Gary. 

“Not that one! Ms. Davis, you can’t even tell the difference between a mixer and a metronome? That’s basic stuff!”

 Chloe Davis’s voice, full of grievance, piped up: “I… I’m just not very familiar with the equipment here.” 

Mason Knight’s voice immediately cut in, full of protective indignation: “Gary, do you have to be so aggressive? Chloe just started. You were all Scarlett Hayes’s old colleagues, so naturally, you’re biased towards her. You haven’t even seen Chloe’s real capabilities.” 

Gary scoffed, as if he’d heard the biggest joke. 

“Capabilities? What capabilities? Is Mr. Knight saying she can produce music with some fake talent? Innate musicality? I’ll believe it when she brings a deceased artist back to sing a few notes!”

 Several other producers began whispering, skepticism etched on their faces.

Seeing the tension escalate, I pushed open the door and calmly interrupted them.

“Gary, I’m just here to pack my things.”

The office instantly fell silent, all eyes on me.

I packed my desk items one by one. Chloe Davis, standing beside me, looked increasingly upset.

When I picked up a photo of me with the Knight family, she lunged and knocked over my box.

“Scarlett Hayes, are you gloating now?!”

The cardboard box crashed to the floor with a loud bang, and the only photo of me with the Knight family shattered into pieces.

The piano model Mason Knight had given me for my eighteenth birthday was also smashed to smithereens.

The sharp edge of the box cut Chloe Davis’s finger, and blood immediately welled up.

Mason Knight’s face instantly changed.

 He carefully blew on her finger, his voice filled with tenderness: “Chloe, are you okay? Let me see! Don’t move, I’ll take you to get that wound treated!”

“Scarlett Hayes, can’t you face reality? You have nothing to do with us, the Knight family, or Stellar Entertainment anymore!”
