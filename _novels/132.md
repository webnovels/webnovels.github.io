I grew up showered with endless love and affection. My parents, fearing I might be taken advantage of in the future, specially arranged for three young men to be raised alongside me as potential suitors.

However, these three treated me coldly, while showing great enthusiasm towards the daughter of our family's driver. In my naivety, I believed it was because they felt a sense of distance from me due to my status.

Until one fateful incident changed everything.

Mia Gray and I were kidnapped together. Felix Foster, the leader of my three suitors, prioritized her safety over mine without hesitation.

He coldly stated, "You were born into privilege. Someone will surely avenge you anyway. We're not needed."

Hearing those words cut through my heart like a knife. It was then that I suddenly realized how terribly mistaken I had been all these years.

Once I recovered from my injuries, I took the initiative to approach my father about marrying someone else.

"Dad, I want to marry Ethan Young. I'm willing to accept the arranged marriage."

"But his face has been severely disfigured. Are you sure you're not joking?" my father asked, concern evident in his voice.
