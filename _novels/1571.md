That night, during the corporate retreat, my husband tossed my dignity onto the high-stakes table like a spare chip.
Caleb had been meticulously folding, making disastrous calls, and practically handing the pot to the twenty-two-year-old marketing intern, Tiffany. He let her win again and again, nine hands in a row, a flawless winning streak that had the whole room cheering her on.
I frowned, ready to interject, but Caleb’s hand clamped down, dismissively, on my wrist.
“Don’t sweat it, honey. It’s just a game,” he said, his smile tight, his eyes fixed on Tiffany. “Let the kid enjoy her moment.”
When Tiffany’s greedy gaze landed on the vintage, inherited diamond bangle on my wrist, I instinctively pulled back, trying to protect the last thread of my composure. But before I could speak, Caleb had already agreed to the new stakes for her.
“Fine,” he announced to the room, his eyes shining with cold excitement. “We’ll bet the bracelet.”
Laughter erupted around the table, a booming sound that only amplified the sickening chill settling in my chest.
It was then, in the suffocating silence of my inner world, that my abdomen gave a sudden, soft thrum. A gentle, nascent voice, a strange echo I’d only heard since I became pregnant, resonated in my core.
“Mom. Bet it.” The voice was strangely calm. “I’m your Fortune Charm, the Ace Baby. We can’t lose.”
I lifted my gaze, meeting Tiffany’s challenging stare, and slowly, deliberately, I unclasped the diamond bangle.

The silence that followed was total. Everyone at the table and those gathered around froze, watching my hands.
“Is she really going through with it?” someone muttered. “I remember that bracelet. Caleb gave it to Bella for their tenth anniversary.”
“Well, the CEO agreed to the stakes. Can’t back out now.”
“This is getting heated. Pass the scotch, there’s going to be a show.”
I placed the bangle softly on the green felt.
It was indeed my tenth-anniversary gift from Caleb. Back then, under the soft lighting of a high-end steakhouse, he’d looked at me with an earnest devotion I hadn’t questioned, and said, “This is forever, Bella. Just like us.”
And now? He was betting our ‘forever’ on a hand of high-stakes poker.
Tiffany’s eyes were wide, bright with unbridled avarice, glued to the glittering diamonds.
“It’s beautiful,” she breathed. “Bet it. Are you game, Bella?”
I looked to Caleb one last time, waiting for him to step in, to show a sliver of respect.
He merely offered a dismissive laugh. “It’s a retreat, Tiffany. We’re having fun. Besides, you won’t necessarily lose, honey.”
Marcus, our CFO, quickly jumped in to back him up. “Exactly, Ms. Bella. Your luck isn’t that bad.”
My cheeks were burning, as if he’d slapped me. Everyone in the private room was watching, whispering. The boss’s wife being pushed to this extreme was certainly a rarity.
Then, the gentle reassurance from my core returned.
“Don’t worry, Mom. I’ve got this.”
My heart settled again. Since I’d become pregnant, there had been a strange, almost mystical shift in our luck. The company had landed two massive deals. I'd bought a lottery scratch-off on a whim and won a decent chunk of cash. Caleb had joked then, “This kid’s a little godsend.”
Now, the godsend was speaking. I’d be a fool not to listen.
I took a slow, deep breath, and nodded. “Fine. I’m in.”
Caleb raised a brow, a flicker of something—satisfaction, maybe—in his eyes. Tiffany’s face lit up, and she eagerly sat back down.
“The next hand takes the pot!”
The cards were shuffled, cut, and dealt. The four of us at the main table were myself, Caleb, Tiffany, and Marcus.
My hands trembled slightly. Not from fear of losing the diamond bangle, but from pure, raw rage at Caleb’s complicity and Tiffany’s audacity. Beneath the anger, a terrible question started to beat: Were there more secrets between them? Secrets that had already shattered my bottom line...
The hand began. I played cautiously, but my cards were trash.
It was Caleb’s turn to act. He casually ran his thumb over the edge of his chips, a subtle glance flicking toward Tiffany.
“Fold.”
“Call and raise!” Tiffany announced, pushing a mountain of chips forward.
She won the hand. Caleb had folded right into her path, allowing her to take a clean, massive pot. He’d seen her weak bluff and had deliberately withdrawn to give her the win.
“Sorry, Ms. Bella,” Tiffany giggled, pushing her stack of chips toward the center. She extended a manicured hand. “The bangle is mine, all-in pot rules.”
Caleb chuckled, pulling out his own wallet to cover the agreed-upon equivalent in cash and chips for the loss. “Tiffany, your luck is incredible. You're unstoppable.”
Tiffany slipped the bracelet onto her wrist, admiring the sparkle under the recessed lighting. “It really is gorgeous.”
Caleb gave her a look that was entirely too soft, too fond. “It suits you perfectly.”
A sharp, visceral pain pierced me. On a normal night, a reward to an eager employee would be one thing. But this was our anniversary gift. And he was openly, shamelessly, favoring her.
“Don’t be sad, Mom.” The fetal voice cut through the sting. “Keep betting. What we lose now, we’ll win back later.”

Tiffany’s face was flush with triumph, her eyes meeting mine in a blatant challenge.
“Another hand, Bella?” she asked, using my first name like a deliberate insult.
Marcus, the CFO, chimed in, stirring the pot. “Don’t stop now! I’ve lost a ton of cash; I need a chance to redeem myself…”
Caleb remained silent, watching me. He was waiting for my reaction.
I smiled, my voice unnervingly level. “Sure. That was just a warm-up.”
I straightened up in my seat, placing my hands flat on the felt. “Let’s keep going.”
Tiffany looked briefly confused, then her face broke into a wider, more eager smile. “Great. What are the stakes this time?”
Her eyes scanned me from my expensive blazer to my Louboutin heels, finally settling on the solitaire diamond pendant at my neck—Caleb’s gift to me for my last birthday.
She pointed, her finger like a dart. “That. The necklace.”
I managed a slight curl of my lip, then reached up and unclipped the clasp. The diamond pendant was far more substantial than the bracelet—easily three times the value. Tiffany’s eyes were huge, and a little gasp escaped her.
The whispers in the room instantly grew louder.
“That’s too much, isn’t it? She’s clearly just trying to strong-arm the boss’s wife.”
“I know. This has to be intentional. You think the rumors are true? Her and Caleb…”
The rest of the sentence trailed off, but the meaning hung heavy in the smoke-filled air.
Caleb turned his head slightly, giving the gossiping crowd a silent, warning glare. The room fell into an awkward hush.
My hands, hidden below the table, clenched into white-knuckled fists.
So, it was true. While I was home, pregnant, protecting myself and the baby, Caleb had found comfort—and a partner in crime—in his eager intern.
Seeing my composure, Caleb coughed lightly. “Maybe we should wrap it up, Bella? Just play for the house money.”
“No!” Tiffany and I snapped in perfect, chilling unison.
Caleb looked surprised, turning his complex gaze on me. “You really want to bet it?”
I met his eyes with a cold confidence I didn't entirely feel. “What, are you worried I’ll lose, or that she will?”
He held my stare for a long moment, his expression unreadable, then gave a curt nod. “Have it your way.”
I began to deal the cards again.
This hand, I was hyper-aware. I listened to the shifting air, the scrape of chips, and the minute changes in their body language. After I had a strong set, I held back from announcing my hand, instead watching Caleb and Marcus.
I noticed it immediately: every time I reached for a card, Caleb’s fingers would tap a certain way on his water glass. Tiffany would read the signal, adjusting her chips or her expression. Marcus was in on it, too, folding or raising the precise amount to push the pot and shape the betting for Tiffany.
Three people, collaborating. The only one left out of the loop was me.
“Mom, the girl behind you isn't right.” The soft voice of the baby suddenly warned.
I subtly tilted my head, catching the reflection in the window behind me. Mia, Tiffany’s friend and a junior admin, was standing slightly to my left, leaning in, her eyes fixed on my cards.
There it was. An extra set of eyes. No wonder Tiffany had been able to avoid my strong hands and pull off those huge winning bluffs.
“Mia, darling, would you be a dear and grab everyone a fresh round of lattes?” I called out suddenly, my voice deceptively warm. Mia jumped, startled.
I gave her a gentle, focused look. “You look tired, sweetie. Take a break.”
Mia’s face flushed scarlet. She glanced desperately at Tiffany, then stammered an apology and hurried to the corner to get the order.
The game resumed. Without her eyes, Tiffany looked slightly unsettled, her gaze flickering constantly between Caleb and Marcus.
The hand dragged on. We were down to the final draw.
Caleb reached for his card, touched it, and hesitated a moment too long. He pushed it back into his stack.
“Call.”
“All in!” Tiffany shouted, slamming her chips down.
I called her bluff, but she was telling the truth. She revealed her hand—a perfectly played Straight Flush.
“Oh, too bad, Bella,” Tiffany said, her smile blinding. “It looks like I win again.”
She snatched the solitaire pendant, clipped it around her neck, and immediately pulled out her phone for a selfie.
Marcus burst out in forced laughter. “The boss’s wife is having a rough night! Maybe pregnancy is draining your luck.”
Another manager, an oily man named Todd, leaned in. “We used to say Ms. Bella’s pregnancy was boosting the company. Looks like the Fortune Charm is with someone else now. Ms. Tiffany must be the new lucky star.”
Caleb stared at me, a complicated mix of arrogance and relief in his eyes.
“A bet is a bet, Bella,” he said, his voice flat. “You have to honor it.”
I kept my expression blank, swallowing the burning indignation.
“Don’t panic, Mom.” The fetal voice was back, steady as a heartbeat. “They’re trying to bait you, to push you to lose control, to go for the ultimate stakes.”
“Trust me. I’m ready.”

The atmosphere in the private room had shifted from a fun retreat to a predatory circus.
I had lost twice. My most valuable personal jewelry was gone. The colleagues had stopped pretending to play and were crowding around, watching the spectacle. Tiffany, wearing my diamonds and my bangle, was the smug center of attention.
“Want to play another hand, Bella?” she taunted, running a finger over the stone on the pendant. “Though, I’m not sure you have anything left to bet.”
I considered the remaining stakes. My designer handbag? My car keys? She wouldn't be interested.
I was right. Tiffany spoke, her voice laced with heavy expectation.
“How about… we bet something really interesting.”
She turned to Caleb, their eyes locking in a silent, conspiratorial moment.
“Let’s bet company stock.”
The room went dead silent. Everyone understood. This was no longer a game.
Our company, AxelTech, was named after a combination of our initials—Caleb’s and mine. Caleb held 40%, I held 35%, and the remaining 25% belonged to our investor, Mr. Vance.
My heart gave a heavy, cold thump. I finally understood the full scope of their plot. Tiffany didn’t want the jewelry. Caleb wanted to use her hand to dilute my ownership.
I spoke, my voice sharp and cold. “Your salary is barely four thousand a month, Tiffany. Where is your capital to bet against 15% of AxelTech?”
Tiffany grinned, turning back to Caleb. “Can I borrow it from you, Caleb?”
Caleb paused for a calculated second, then laughed, loud and artificial. “Sure. We’re just playing, darling. Lighten up.”
Playing with company shares?
I stared at Caleb. How long had he been planning this entire charade? It didn’t matter now. If he wanted to play, I would show him what a real game looked like.
“If we’re betting shares, we’ll do this officially. Call Attorney Reyes and have him draft the agreement,” I instructed Marcus.
Marcus flinched. “Ms. Bella, are you serious?”
“Call him,” I repeated, my voice leaving no room for argument.
Caleb’s brows furrowed, and a line of irritation appeared between his eyes. “Bella, are you going to make this difficult?”
“Didn’t you start this game?” I challenged, meeting his gaze.
There were too many people here, too many witnesses. If I lost, he would take my shares without a second thought. But if he lost, without a contract, he would simply walk away. I knew him too well.
Caleb’s face darkened. He stared at me for five solid seconds, a cold appraisal.
“Fine,” he conceded. “Have it your way.”
Attorney Reyes arrived half an hour later.
“Attorney Reyes, I need a legal agreement. The stakes are 15% of my shares in AxelTech.”
Fifteen percent. It was a significant slice. If Caleb acquired it, added to his 40%, he would control a whopping 55%, turning the company into a dictatorship.
Tiffany’s eyes gleamed with reckless excitement. “My capital will be the bracelet, the necklace… and a $1 million loan from Caleb?” She looked at him for confirmation. “I can sign a promissory note, right?”
Caleb nodded, his smile returning, a sickening, proprietary look. “Done. I’ll guarantee the loan. If you lose, I cover it.”
The collective wow from the surrounding colleagues was audible. The favoritism was blatant. Caleb, however, simply crossed his arms, waiting for the deal to be struck.
The agreement was drafted. I signed, Tiffany signed, and Caleb signed as the guarantor. A legally binding contract, in black and white.
Before the cards were dealt, I touched my swollen belly. “Baby, this is all on you now.”
The fetal voice was strong, steady, and certain. “Mom, relax. I’m thinking three steps ahead.”
The final high-stakes hand began. This time, the silence was agonizing. Tiffany was sweating. Caleb was chain-smoking. I, oddly, was calm.
I reached for my last card, the one I needed. I glanced at Tiffany, her face tight with desperation. She reached, and her face brightened.
“I’m in!” she crowed. “I hit the full house!”
The room erupted. Marcus was the first to cheer. “Congratulations, Ms. Tiffany! You’re a co-owner of AxelTech!”
Tiffany was radiant with arrogance. She leaned back, glancing at me. “Thanks for the shares, Bella.”
Caleb laughed, clapping her on the shoulder. “Incredible luck, Tiffany. Everyone, say hello to your new partner, Ms. Thorne.”
The congratulations swirled around her. But I barely heard them.
I lost again. The bangle, the necklace, the shares. My hands and feet felt frozen, my heart pounding a frantic rhythm.
What was left to lose?
“Mom. Don’t panic.” The voice was sharper this time, a sudden jolt of electricity. “I let them win. They needed to think they had the advantage. They needed to be pushed over the edge.”
“Now. Bet everything you have left. The whole pot. We crush them now.”

The game was paused. Tiffany was basked in the congratulations of the crowd. Caleb was on a phone call, a smug, satisfied expression on his face. Marcus came over, feigning concern.
“Ms. Bella, maybe call it a night? You’ve had a bad run.”
I didn’t look at him.
“Keep going.” My voice cut through the noise, and the room went quiet again.
Tiffany turned, confused. “You want to play again? I don’t think you have anything left that can cover the stakes, Bella.” She rattled the agreement in her hand.
I sat back down and surveyed the entire room.
“ALL IN,” I announced.
“I’ll bet my remaining 20% of AxelTech shares.”
“I’ll bet my personal trust fund.”
“And I’ll bet half of our marital assets.”
A collective gasp swept through the room. She’s lost it.
Caleb slammed his phone down and strode over.
“Bella, enough!” he hissed, his eyes narrowed with genuine fury. He wasn’t mad that I’d lost—he was mad that I was ruining his neat, contained plan.
I glanced at him, then back at Tiffany. “You wanted to play big, Tiffany. I’m playing to the end.”
Tiffany’s eyes were filled with a wild mix of caution and insatiable greed. “I… I don’t have the capital for that.”
“You can borrow it,” I said, finishing her thought for her. “From your CEO.”
Caleb squinted at me, calculating. “Are you certain, Bella? If you lose this, you have no financial footing left.” He knew exactly how much was in that personal trust.
“I am certain,” I stated, cutting the air with the finality of the words.
Marcus rushed forward to intervene. “Ms. Bella, please! Don’t let the adrenaline control you!”
“It’s just a game!” a chorus of other managers pleaded.
Just a game. The perfect cover for all their malice.
Tiffany looked at Caleb, playing the innocent damsel. “Caleb, can I borrow that much?”
Caleb was silent for a few heavy seconds, then his lips stretched into a cruel, patronizing smile. “Yes.”
He placed a hand on my shoulder, his voice softening, attempting a familiar intimacy. “Don’t worry, darling. If you lose, I’ll take care of you. You can take an early maternity leave, quit worrying about the company, and just focus on the baby.”
The words were gentle, but the knife was already twisting. His goal was laid bare: to push me out of the company so he and Tiffany could take complete control.
I scoffed, my eyes focusing on Attorney Reyes. “Please call a third-party notary. Redraft the agreement, to be signed now.”
I looked at Caleb and Tiffany. “And this final hand will be Heads-Up. Just the two of us. No partners.”
Caleb and Tiffany exchanged a panicked look. Without Marcus's help, the risk was enormous.
I gave a cold laugh. “What’s the matter? Are you scared, Tiffany, without Caleb and Marcus to help you with the signals?”
Tiffany’s face went crimson. “I’m not scared! I just won a full house on my own!”
I smiled, tossing the pen toward the freshly printed agreement.
Caleb was furious but had no choice but to sign as the guarantor. Attorney Reyes and the notary set up a camera, ensuring the entire process was documented and legally sound. Everyone else was pushed back five meters.
The table was cleared. Tiffany sat across from me, her composure completely gone.
“Let’s begin.”
I shuffled and dealt the cards. This final hand was slow, deliberate. Tiffany was twitchy, looking frequently over my shoulder.
I played blind. I didn't set my cards in a traditional rack, laying them flat on the table, face up. I forced Tiffany to guess my hand.
Her eyes kept darting to the far distance where Caleb stood. Caleb was making subtle hand gestures, but he was hesitant—it was too high-stakes, and he couldn't see my cards to be certain of his advice.
I drew the last card I needed. My heart leaped, but I didn't move.
I looked up at Tiffany, giving her a slow, predatory smile. “Tiffany, do you know why Caleb has been helping you all night?”
She froze, her eyes wide with a mixture of confusion and fear.
“It’s not because you’re young or pretty,” I whispered. “It’s because he thinks you’re stupid.”
Her face drained of color. “You’re talking nonsense! Just play the card!”
I gave a gentle tug at the corner of my lips. “We’ll know soon enough.”
Tap.
I revealed the card in my hand. It was the Ace of Spades.
