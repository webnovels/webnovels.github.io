The next second, I pulled out my resignation application. "Also, please sign this so I can leave the company."

Vivian was flustered. Everyone in the room looked on with mixed expressions, some hesitating, wanting to advise me.

But then, *whoosh!*

Marcus swept the drinks and fruit bowls off the table, looking utterly humiliated. "You two are a couple?!"

"Vivian, I told you, the love I want is one where only I exist in your eyes. If you had a boyfriend, you should have just said so. There was no need to take revenge on me like this!"

He stormed out. Vivian snapped back to reality and, losing all composure, slapped me. "How dare you make a scene in front of Marcus? Why did you expose our relationship? He's sensitive and can't handle shocks, don't you know that?"

My head was snapped sideways from the blow, my eyes cold. 

The fierce fire in her eyes suddenly died, replaced by a flicker of distress. The hand that hit me trembled violently. 

She turned her head away and said sharply, "You just want to force me into marriage, but your plan failed. I'd like to see how you're going to cause trouble for Marcus without the job I gave you!"

She snatched my resignation application and signed it. The next second, she shouted "Marcus!" and ran off, chasing him.

I rubbed the crumpled paper, and with a sense of relief, I left amidst the stunned gazes of the crowd.

Now, there was only one thing left to do. After Mom passed, I decided to take her ashes abroad, so I had only arranged a simple memorial. 

Tomorrow, I needed to pick up Mom's ashes and belongings from the hospital.

The next morning, I timed my arrival at the hospital perfectly, intending to leave straight for the airport afterward. 

As I passed a department, I overheard a doctor calling out Vivian's name.

"You young people are crazy in love! Your eyes are inflamed, ulcerated, and bleeding. You could go blind permanently! You can't keep doing this!"

I unconsciously slowed my steps. 

Then I heard Marcus's whining voice.

 "Vivian, I was just being dramatic yesterday when I said I'd only forgive you if you had eyes only for me! Why did you actually tattoo my name all over your eyeballs?!"

Vivian's voice was full of deep affection. "For you, it's nothing."

I turned my head and saw Vivian's eyes.

 Her eyelids were swollen, blood vessels burst, and they were hazy with blood. 

I could faintly see her eyeballs were dark, densely covered with Marcus's name.

Yet, before, when I had just bought a pair of matching couple's rings, she had cursed me out, saying I was deliberately claiming ownership and trying to tie her down, restricting her freedom.

Turns out, in the face of love, everyone is equally desperate.

I continued toward the morgue. Marcus had already spotted me and deliberately picked a fight. 

"Alex, Vivian said you're just a persistent admirer who won't give up. What do you want now?"

Vivian, surprisingly, wasn't angry at all. She quickly put on her sunglasses, adjusted her hair, and her lips curved upward. 

"Alex, I know you came here looking for me on purpose. As long as you swear not to do anything out of line again, I can still let you come back to the company. I heard your mom is in our city recently. I could be generous and take her on a trip."

My eyes were full of sarcasm. 

What "out of line" things? Should I continue to be her secret lover, smilingly bless her and Marcus, and then, after she's had her fun and decided to settle down, gratefully marry her?

To this day, she still didn't know that Mom had already died, her last wish being for me to find someone who loved me.

The nurse, however, couldn't wait. She rushed out to find me, handing me Mom's ashes and belongings. 

"Alex, I have other families to attend to. Just sign here, and you can take your mother's ashes."
