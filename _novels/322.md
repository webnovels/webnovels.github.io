"After my family went bankrupt, Mom's best friend took me in.

That's how I ended up being chased by the Sheffield brothers since I was a kid.

Everyone envied the way they doted on me.

But when I wanted to settle down and have kids, they both turned me down.

“I'm focused on my career,” said the older one. “Marriage isn't on my radar.”

The younger one was even worse. “I'm still young. I want to have some fun. Besides, casual flings don't mean anything.”

The next day, at my birthday party, they both proposed to the nanny's daughter.

To make her happy, they forced me, someone with a sensitive stomach, to drink a shot of strong liquor.

As I was rushed to the hospital with a bleeding ulcer, they covered her eyes and laughed, accusing me of faking it.

That was it. I was done. The day I was discharged, I called my mom.

""I'll marry Luke Lancaster."""
