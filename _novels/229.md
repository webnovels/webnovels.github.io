My husband, Mark, was a pharmaceutical giant. The day he perfected the "Lethean Elixir," a drug designed to erase deep-seated emotions, our son, Ethan, finally cracked a smile. “Can we give this to Mom?” he asked, “So she won’t love us anymore?”

Mark nodded resolutely. Ethan brought the elixir to me, a syrupy green concoction, and with a practiced lie, convinced me to drink it. I gave a bitter laugh and downed it in one gulp. Father and son exchanged relieved glances. They were finally free to be with her.

But why, then, did they weep and wail later, "Don't you love us at all anymore?"
