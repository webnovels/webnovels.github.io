Chapter 1
Roxanne Reid's labor had been exceptionally difficult. After finally having the baby through a C-section, she swore to herself that she would cherish and care for the child for the rest of her life.

But when she came out of the operating room and opened her eyes, the baby was nowhere to be found.

Her husband, Stanley Frey, had given the baby away.

Bracing her body against the pain, she sat up and asked, "Where's the baby? Where did you take our child?"

Seeing her gnashing her teeth and glaring at him, Stanley lost his patience. "Why are you bringing this up again? Didn't I already tell you? The baby was given to Macy as soon as it was born."

Roxanne felt her chest tighten. Her voice trembled with anger as she screamed, "Did I agree to that?

"Didn't I say my child isn't to be given away unless I'm dead? Do you think I'm just talking nonsense?"

Two days and nights of labor had drained every ounce of strength from her body. She gritted her teeth, pressing her thighs together to keep herself upright through the pain.

Seeing this, Stanley raised his voice even more. "Roxanne, can you be a little reasonable? I've explained everything to you. Why are you still making a scene?

"The Frey family owes it to Macy. We should make it up to her by giving her the child.

"Oliver died of cancer. Macy was his fiancée. We can't just let her live a lonely life, can we?"

Then, as if realizing something, he softened his tone slightly, sitting on the hospital bed. "I know you're hurting. I'm hurting, too.

"But we have to be grateful. Macy chose not to marry anyone else. Instead, she stayed in the Frey residence to care for my parents and bear the hardships of a daughter-in-law in your stead. How is it wrong to give her a child?

"Rox, you and I can have many more children. Giving this baby to Macy is just compensation for her. I know you're not that petty."

Roxanne trembled with rage.

Other than Stanley, everyone else knew why Macy Shaw stayed single after Oliver Frey passed away. But was Stanley really that ignorant?

Looking at the familiar yet alien man before her, a chill ran up her spine.

They had dated for five years and been married for two. They should have been the closest of all couples. Yet now, she could barely recognize him.

Back then, Stanley's pursuit of her had been the talk of all Brindley. She was just an ordinary woman from Airville, and for some reason, she caught the eye of the local wealthy heir. Everyone assumed he was just playing around.

But he pursued her relentlessly for two whole years. Even after being rejected countless times, he never gave up.

He learned all her hobbies and studied her interests just so they would always have something to talk about. How could she not have fallen for him?

So she accepted his proposal, intending to spend her life with him. She even severed ties with her family for him. From dating to marriage, Stanley had been unwavering, spoiling her beyond measure.

He had once told her she was the only line he would never cross.

Everything changed after Oliver died and Macy became his bereaved fiancée. Only then did Roxanne realize how easily that line could be crossed.

Suddenly, a phone rang, breaking the tense silence between them.

Stanley answered anxiously, spoke briefly, and then hurriedly turned to leave.

"Macy's a first-time mom. She doesn't know how to care for a baby. She needs someone there, so I'll go help her first.

"If anything comes up, call Lily. She'll handle everything."

Gritting her teeth through the pain, Roxanne grabbed his sleeve and threatened in a raw voice, "Stanley, bring the baby back, or we're getting a divorce."

She thought the threat would frighten him.

But he only sneered, snatched the phone off her nightstand, and said, "Stop reading those mindless romance novels. I'm your only support. Without me, what can you even do?

"Rox, you know what I'm capable of. Don't push me to take action against you."
