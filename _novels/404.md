At the reunion, my CEO husband deliberately lost a game.

With his friends egging him on, he planned to tie the knot with his first love and announce it on SnapChat.

Everyone present started cheering them on, and my husband eagerly pulled out the divorce papers, demanding my cooperation:

"It's just a game, don't take it too seriously."

I stayed silent for a long time, and everyone expected me to explode.

But I just took the divorce papers and said calmly:

"Divorce is fine, but I need you to do three things first."

He readily agreed, rushing me to sign, even promising eagerly:

"Forget three things, I'll do three hundred, as long as you sign! And once we remarry, I'll give you a lavish wedding!"

But he didn't know that the moment he decided to divorce me, my 'capture' mission had already failed, and the system was about to erase me.

I could only survive by completing the three tasks the system gave me.
