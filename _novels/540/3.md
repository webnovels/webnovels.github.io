The next day, I found the doctor again.

“Ms. [Aria's Last Name], are you sure you want to sign this 'Consent to Forgo Treatment' form?”

The doctor’s pen hovered above the paper, his eyes behind his glasses showing confusion.

I slowly nodded.

“Given your current physical condition, a kidney transplant is almost equivalent to suicide.”

The doctor lowered his voice. “Not to mention keeping the fetus.”

“I understand.”

I reached out for the fountain pen, saying indifferently, “But the surgery must be done.”

“At least wait until the fetus is twelve weeks…”

“He can’t wait anymore.” I cut off the doctor, signing my name on the consent form.

The ink bled, like a black tear.

At the end of the hallway, a long line of women waited at the obstetrics and gynecology clinic, each pregnant woman touching her swollen belly, her face radiating a happiness I dared not dream of.

I clutched the examination report, the words ‘Termination of Pregnancy’ stinging my eyes.

The operating table was colder than I imagined.

As the instruments clinked, I bit down hard on my lip, staring at the ceiling.

A sharp pain spread from my lower abdomen to my entire body. My nails dug into my palms, but it was nothing compared to the pain in my heart.

Tears streamed down my temples into my hairline. I thought of the hope and disappointment with every pregnancy test over the past seven years, and the euphoria of last week when I learned I was pregnant.

This child, unwanted by its father, perhaps it was better if it never came into this world.

The nurse wiped the blood from between my legs. “You can leave after half an hour of rest.”

I nodded mechanically, my hand instinctively touching my flat abdomen.

There had once been a heartbeat. Now, only a desolate silence remained.

It was dusk when I returned to the villa.

I pushed open the door, and a sweet, cloying scent of ginger tea hit me.

In the living room, Liam was half-kneeling in front of the sofa, one hand holding a bowl, the other gently stroking Serena’s hair.

“Just one more sip, hmm?”

His voice was achingly gentle, completely unfamiliar. “Drink it, and your stomach won’t hurt anymore.”

Serena was wrapped in *my* wool blanket, her face pale, yet the moment she saw me, a triumphant smile appeared.

She deliberately let out a soft moan, burrowing deeper into Liam’s arms. “Liam, it hurts so much…”

Only then did Liam notice me standing at the doorway.

His gaze lingered on my pale face for a second, then he frowned. “Where have you been? You didn’t answer your phone.”

I opened my mouth, but no words came out.

Was I supposed to say I’d just gone and killed our baby?

“Go make Serena a bowl of brown sugar water.”

He commanded, then turned to gently coax the woman in his arms, “Aria makes the best brown sugar water, try some.”

Aria.

He hadn’t called me that in a long time.

In the kitchen, I mechanically sliced ginger, the knife blade grazing my fingertips several times.

Pains in my abdomen came in waves, cold sweat beaded on my back.

When the water boiled, I felt a dizzy spell, grabbing the counter to keep from falling.

“Not done yet?”

Liam’s voice came from behind me. “Serena’s waiting uncomfortably.”
