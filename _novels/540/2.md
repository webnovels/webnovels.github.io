The ceiling swayed in my vision, the antiseptic stinging my nostrils.

I blinked, the metallic taste of blood still lingering in my throat.

I opened my mouth, but no sound came out.

My hand unconsciously went to my abdomen. It was still flat, yet it already held the life I’d yearned for seven years.

The ward door suddenly kicked open, slamming against the wall with a thunderous bang.

I jumped, my IV tube swaying violently.

Liam strode in, his suit as crisp as if he’d just left a board meeting.

In his arms, Serena, like a lazy cat, was wearing that Chanel dress I’d seen in a magazine last week.

“Finally awake.”

Liam’s voice was edged with impatience. “I’ve waited three hours for you.”

My fingernails dug into my palms.

Three hours? I’d been unconscious for a whole day and night.

Serena peeked out from his arm, her lips slightly pouted. “Liam, it smells awful in here. I’m getting dizzy.”

Liam immediately clutched her tighter, pulling out a delicate small bottle from his pocket and placing it at her nose.

“Peppermint essential oil. Just sniff it.”

I watched silently, like a surreal play unfolding before me.

The man who once took an entire day off because of my period cramps was now carefully attending to someone else.

Liam turned to me, suddenly pulling a document from his briefcase. “Aria, Serena has kidney failure and needs a transplant.”

“The matching results show you’re the most suitable donor.”

The document was shoved into my hand. I looked down at the words ‘Living Kidney Donation Consent Form’ and suddenly wanted to laugh.

“She’s young and afraid of pain.”

Liam’s voice softened. It was the first time today he’d used that tone with me.

“You’ve always been strong, and you recover quickly.”

A tear splattered onto the signature line, blurring a small patch.

I looked up at Liam. His brows were slightly furrowed, but his gaze was fixed on Serena.

His fingers gently ran through her long hair.

“Pen.”

I reached out, my voice so hoarse it didn’t sound like my own.

Liam visibly froze, as if he hadn’t expected me to agree so readily.

He hastily pulled out his fountain pen and handed it to me. Our wedding anniversary was still engraved on it.

I shakily signed my name, each stroke like I was personally burying my own love.

After signing, I quickly tucked the cancer diagnosis under my pillow.

Liam visibly relaxed, a long-lost tenderness appearing on his face. “Thank you. I’ll cover all the surgery costs, and afterward… I’ll take care of you.”

What generous charity.

I turned my face away, looking out the window.

The sun was still so bright, shining on the small wildflowers on the windowsill.

“After you’re discharged, I’ll take you to Switzerland to see the snow-capped mountains.”

He continued, his tone lighter now. “Didn’t you always want to go?”

My heart clenched violently.

It was something we promised during our honeymoon.

To go to Switzerland together on our seventh anniversary.

He remembered after all. But now the promise sounded so bitterly ironic.

“Liam…”

Serena suddenly cut him off in a delicate voice, “It’s so stuffy in here, I feel sick…”

Liam’s face instantly changed. He scooped her up in his arms. “We’re going back right now.”

He turned to leave, then paused. “The surgery is scheduled for next Wednesday. Get some good rest these next few days.”

The ward door closed again, his footsteps fading away.

“Tsk tsk, how impressive.”

The nurses’ whispers drifted from the doorway. “No wonder she can be Mrs. [Liam's Last Name]. She’d even give her life for him.”

I pulled the blanket up over my face, finally letting the tears flow freely.
