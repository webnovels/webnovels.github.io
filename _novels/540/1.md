On our seventh wedding anniversary, I received my late-stage lung cancer diagnosis.

“Ms. [Aria's Last Name], based on the test results, you’re seven weeks pregnant.”

The doctor’s voice seemed to drift from a far-off place. “However, given your current condition, you must begin chemotherapy immediately.”

I clutched the diagnosis in my hand, unable to stop myself from asking, “What if… what if I want to keep this baby?”

The doctor pushed up his glasses, his tone heavy. “The cancer cells have already spread. If you don’t get immediate treatment, your survival period might not exceed six months.”

“And chemotherapy drugs could cause fetal deformities or even death.”

I whispered, “So, if the baby lives, I have to die?”

“Ms. [Aria's Last Name], I advise you to terminate the pregnancy as soon as possible.”

The doctor’s voice was tinged with professional sympathy. “You’re still young. Once your condition stabilizes…”

I didn’t hear the rest of what he said.

Seven years. Liam and I had longed for this child for seven whole years.

Every negative pregnancy test felt like it was mocking my foolish hopes.

Now it was finally here, but it had to be my killer.

As I walked out of the hospital, I touched my abdomen, making a decision.

I was going to tell Liam the good news. Maybe this child could save our increasingly cold marriage.

Maybe, just maybe, he’d hold me tight like he did seven years ago, saying, “Aria, don’t be scared, I’m here.”

The villa was empty. Liam wasn’t back again.

I had grown used to it. Ever since Serena returned three months ago, he rarely stayed overnight at home.

I changed into his favorite white dress and began preparing our anniversary dinner.

Candlelight, red wine, his favorite steak.

I wrote “Happy 7th Anniversary” on the cake, then sat at the dining table, waiting for him.

My phone screen lit up. It was a video from an unknown number.

The moment I opened it, my blood froze.

Fireworks bloomed in the night sky, forming the letters “AL forever.”

That was our special fireworks display, the one he designed for me when Liam and I got married.

AL, for Aria and Liam, our initials.

But now, standing under the fireworks was Serena, Liam leaning in to kiss her forehead.

The video ended on Serena’s smug, triumphant smile.

“Aria, did you really think what you stole could ever truly be yours?”

“Take a good look, see who he truly loves.”

My phone slipped from my hand and clattered to the floor. A metallic taste rose in my throat.

I stumbled, grabbing the dining table, and a mouthful of fresh blood splattered onto the pristine white cake.

In the last second before darkness claimed me, I seemed to hear Liam, seven years ago, whispering in my ear.

“Aria, in this life, I’ll only set off fireworks for you.”
