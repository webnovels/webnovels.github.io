That night, after my husband got drunk, I ended up pregnant with quadruplets.

I cherished these children deeply, so I quit my job as an online content monitor to rest at home. Every night, I suffered from pregnancy-related nausea.

Later, at the dinner table, he used sign language to communicate with four men.

Declan glanced at me, gesturing with his hands.

“A woman with wide hips is really fertile. Just one night is enough to get her pregnant with children from four different men.”

“According to the bet, each of you owes me five million!”

The four men clicked their tongues.

“To get money for your first love’s treatment, you really went all out, didn’t you? Aren’t you afraid she’ll find out you tricked her?”

Declan looked at me with eyes full of hatred.

“She’s too dumb to understand sign language. Besides, if she hadn’t turned a blind eye and let those nude photos of Cora pass, would Cora have attempted suicide and ended up in a coma? I’d do anything to cure Cora!”

It turns out, none of the four kids were his.

But he didn’t know that I used to be a sign language researcher, and I understood their conversation.

I was heartbroken and agreed to the doctor’s advice for an abortion...
