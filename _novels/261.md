My Eight-Year Marriage: A Scapegoat No More!

I’d been with my husband for eight years.

He was the perfect husband, attentive to my every need.

Until the news broke that my best friend was back in the country and had been hurt.

At the grand opening, he ditched me and ran to the one who truly held his heart.

The next day, I received the divorce papers.

Eight years of devotion, and it all meant nothing the moment his ex came back. I finally got it.
