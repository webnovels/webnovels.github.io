Jasper won the MMA championship on the same date as our five-year wedding anniversary. That day, I received a gift he had prepared for me: Phoebe's pregnancy test report, the secretary of the MMA Club.

Seeing my devastation, he spoke with indifference, "Adeline, Phoebe's health is poor. I'm planning to let her move in with us. You're a doctor, so it would be convenient for you to take care of her."

I hid my own pregnancy test report and called Finn, my Declan, agreeing to go to the USA for further studies with him. But just a few days before leaving, I saw the chat records between Declan and Phoebe on his phone.

【Are you really going to the USA with that woman to fulfill my relationship with Jasper?】

【What if she finds out that it was you who hired those people to break her right hand so she can never hold a scalpel again?】

I wiped away my tears and changed my flight ticket, deciding to head to the UK instead.
