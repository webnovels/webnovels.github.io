On Valentine's Day, my husband took his ex-girlfriend and her daughter out to dinner.

And I, like an idiot, waited all night in a rundown shack with no electricity in the middle of nowhere.

What I got instead was the joyous news of him inheriting billions!

I took my daughter, Stella, to his celebration, hoping to get some answers, but the security guards treated me like a lunatic and nearly beat me to death.

His ex-girlfriend, Celeste, had been upgraded to the 'official' Mrs. Sterling.

A doctored drink claimed my life and Stella's.

Before my last breath, I swore: Blake Sterling, you'll pay for this!

Heaven must have opened its eyes, because I was reborn with all my memories!

This time, I sold off the dilapidated house and headed straight for my family's sprawling 20,000 square foot villa estate.

Just you wait, Blake Sterling! The debt from my past life, I'll make you repay a hundredfold!
