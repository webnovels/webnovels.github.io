Blake had indeed been tightly controlled before, even watching his grandfather’s every expression before speaking.
A rustle of footsteps pulled me from my thoughts.
Blake walked towards me, tugging at his tie, his expensive cologne heavy in the air.
“Aria Hayes, not asking for money again? What new trick have you learned this time?”
I looked at him, confused.
“Don’t pretend. Skylar told me she saw you signing up for those ‘Win Back Your Husband’ workshops. What did you learn there?”
“Suddenly not wanting money, what’s this move called? Playing hard to get?”
Blake’s laugh was mocking. He sat next to me, pulling me into his embrace.
I could hear his heartbeat clearly against my chest.
“Aria Hayes, I’m giving you a chance. Start your performance.”
He laughed again as he said it.
I looked up at him. He was leaning back on the couch.
I couldn’t remember the last time I’d been this close to Blake.
I raised my hand and touched his chest, feeling a tremor.
“Aria Hayes, is that all you’ve got?”
With that, Blake roughly pushed me away. His gaze was filled with utter contempt, as if I were something vile, a piece of trash.
“Blake Sterling, let’s get a divorce.”
I spoke calmly. Blake, who had been standing, froze.
This was the second time I’d mentioned divorce to him. The first was the night I caught him cheating.
My father had left me a substantial inheritance, and no one else knew about it.
But Blake had refused to divorce, saying he wouldn’t let me have half his assets.
He also didn’t believe I’d ever be willing to leave him.
“Oh, really? When?”
Blake smirked carelessly, pulling off his tie and throwing it at my face.
A surge of surprise went through me; I hadn’t expected him to agree so easily. But then he suddenly pinched my chin.
His handsome eyes scrutinized my face. After a long moment, he spoke flippantly.
“Aria Hayes, you’re a terrible student. Find a different workshop.”
