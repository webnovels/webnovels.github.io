Blake Sterling’s latest arm candy was a fresh face, Skylar Vance. Naturally, Blake was the lead investor in her debut film.
Among Blake’s endless string of conquests, Skylar was the youngest, and by far, the boldest.
She flooded my inbox with provocative photos, each one a blatant taunt.
“Mrs. Sterling, everyone says you’re so magnanimous. Can you tell me if these photos are flattering?”
I closed my email without replying, until Blake’s call came through.
“How did those photos get out? Aria Hayes, are you done with your act?”
His cutting tone sliced through the phone, and my heart ached for a few seconds before settling back into stillness.
“I don’t know.”
I spoke flatly. The next second, he hung up.
My phone buzzed relentlessly with notifications from all my social media apps.

The headlines screamed, the photos pixelated, but it wasn’t hard to tell they were identical to the ones Skylar had sent me.
She was young, and her tactics were just as amateur.
Editors from major media outlets flooded my SnapChat with messages.
“Mrs. Sterling, seven figures should do it this time.”
“Mrs. Sterling, we still have time for damage control.”
I replied, “Not interested,” to each of them. The offers stopped coming.
But then, screenshots of my replies to the editors exploded online.
“Guess she’s finally given up.”
“No kidding. Who could keep cleaning up their husband’s messes, time and again?”
“How long until they divorce, do you think?”
I took a deep breath, gazing at the empty mansion around me, a chilling emptiness settling in my chest.
Blake Sterling, consider this my divorce gift to you.
Soon enough, the scandalous photos evaporated as quickly as they’d appeared.
The ‘screenshots’ of my replies were debunked as AI-generated fakes, and major media outlets started dumping dirt on other celebrities to divert attention.
