“Pretty, isn’t it, Mrs. Sterling?”
“I heard your wedding was just at a five-star hotel, no proposal, very rushed and perfunctory. Blake never gave you such a grand proposal, did he?”
“Blake’s friends all say I’m the only girl he’s ever truly cared about.”
Skylar’s voice message sounded utterly smug. She thought her words would drive me crazy.
But my heart was eerily calm. For Blake Sterling, I figured there was only a sliver of love left.
“Congratulations.”
I simply replied with those four words. Her end went silent.
The summer wind rustled the leaves, a dry, whispering sound. I slipped off my wedding ring and placed it on the dresser.
That night, I dreamt of my father. When I woke up, my pillow was soaked with tears.
One hundred and ten missed calls blared on my screen.
Before I could even check them, Blake’s call came in again.
The moment I answered, his barely concealed rage erupted.
“Aria Hayes, I truly underestimated you. All these years, you’ve played the innocent, virtuous wife, but behind my back, you’re more devious than anyone!”
“What?”
I instinctively retorted. He hung up, and then I received a screenshot from Blake.
That proposal video had already soared to the top of every major media platform’s trending topics.
Editors from various media outlets had already sent me their prices. While I was asleep, Sterling Enterprises’ stock had plummeted because of the video.
People were already speculating how much Blake would have to pay out in a divorce settlement.
I looked at the screen full of notifications and felt utterly drained.
Just then, the bedroom door burst open. Blake stood there, eyes bloodshot, gripping my collar.
His eyes blazed with fury. If looks could kill, I would have died a thousand times over.
