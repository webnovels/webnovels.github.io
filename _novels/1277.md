The day I saw my ex-wife again, she had just been parachuted in as the new CEO of our hospital.

For five long years, she had repeatedly mistaken my love for weakness, fueled by the whispers of my closest friend. Because of that man, she became my ex-wife.

I, the Associate Director of Medicine, managed to maintain a brittle professional truce with her until quitting time.

In the early evening, Nurse Keller brought me a message.

“Dr. Logan, the City Medical Association is hosting its annual gala tonight. All the hospital leadership will be there.”

The nurses in the office were debating whether they should attend, and I was about to confirm my attendance when she suddenly appeared in the doorway.

“Dr. Logan, you can’t go. You need to stay tonight and finalize the hospital restructuring plan.”

Under the watchful eyes of the entire department, she summoned me into the CEO's office.

She sat behind the massive mahogany desk, her gaze glacial. “Everyone else is free to go. You, however, must remain.”

“If I find you at that gala tonight, consider yourself warned. The consequences will be yours alone.”

A torrent of old memories flashed through my mind, and a slow burn of anger ignited in my chest.

“Where was this fire, Genevieve, when we were actually married?”

I dropped the barb and turned to leave.

The nurses rushed up to me as I exited, their curiosity palpable.

“Dr. Logan, you know the new CEO?”

I shook my head curtly.

“Dr. Genevieve Abbott is so young, Dr. Logan. I heard she graduated from a top-tier European medical school. And she’s still single!”

At that, the gaggle of gossiping nurses began to buzz. Their noise grated on my last nerve.

“Enough. She’s divorced.”

Ignoring their stunned expressions, I picked up my briefcase, ready to clock out.

“How do you know that, Dr. Logan? You seem pretty sure.” a young scrub nurse pressed.

I had to suppress a cold laugh. Of course, I knew. I was the fool who had been misunderstood and replaced.

Without answering, I strode toward the elevator.

I had warned myself countless times that I would never again allow the past to hurt me. But seeing the ghost of my former life reappear as my superior still sent an unwelcome tremor through my heart.

Genevieve and I had been married for five years.

On our fifth anniversary, I had meticulously planned a romantic dinner, ready to celebrate. But instead, she celebrated on the hospital rooftop with Rhys Callahan, the man who was supposed to be my best friend. They had shared a grand, sweeping public confession.

The grainy hospital security footage showed them embracing and kissing, and the whole hospital was celebrating them, calling them the Golden Pair—the untouchable medical power couple of Seattle’s medical community.

The sweet well wishes, the romantic declaration, the joyful laughter—none of it was for me. All I could do was clear the dinner I’d prepared and hide in the on-call room.

Genevieve had promised me that morning that we would celebrate properly.

I suppose this was what she meant by 'celebrating.'

Watching the footage of their embrace, an unfamiliar, suffocating bitterness clogged my throat. I couldn’t even remember the last time we’d been intimate. I’d always told myself it was because she was consumed by her work. Now, it was clear: she was just consumed by someone else.

If that was the case, I’d grant her the freedom she desired.

I called her. Her voice was as cool and dismissive as ever.

“What is it?”

I tried to get straight to the point, opening my mouth to speak several times, but the words wouldn’t form.

“Where are you?”

“I’m in a meeting,” she replied without a hint of hesitation, even though I could clearly hear Rhys’s distinct laugh echoing in the background of her phone.

I laughed a self-mocking laugh. Why debase myself when I already knew the answer?

“Genevieve, let’s get a divorce.”

A beat of silence followed, then a flicker of suppressed anger in her tone. “Logan, what is this new drama you’re starting?”

“I’ll email the papers.”

I hung up and started packing up my personal effects, preparing to transfer out of the hospital.

I looked at the things I planned to simply toss: the matching coffee mugs, the photos from our shared residency shifts, the expensive stethoscope she had supposedly gifted me.

I realized, with a sudden, stinging clarity, that all the evidence of our love had been purchased by me. She never once initiated anything to solidify our relationship. Even the wedding ring, I’d picked out myself.

No matter how hard I tried, she never committed her full heart to me, and a marriage can’t survive on one person’s effort. Perhaps our relationship, like the framed wedding photo in the corner of my office, was long overdue for removal.

I went to an apartment my parents had left me. That night, I slept more soundly than I had in years.

The next morning, I was woken by a frantic ringing. Genevieve had called me several times.

I answered the phone, and she immediately launched into an angry interrogation: “What are you doing? Your office is completely cleared out!”

“We were supposed to celebrate our anniversary! I even bought you a gift—where the hell are you?”

Her aggressive demands only amplified my irritation. I hung up and tossed the phone aside.

I was used to this routine. When I was pulling a double shift in the ER, on my birthday, or any moment I desperately needed her, she would vanish, pulled away by a single call from Rhys Callahan. Then, the next day, she’d reappear as if nothing had happened, armed with a gift, and demand an explanation from me with an air of superiority, effectively forcing me to apologize for my needs.

If I still resisted, she would soften her posture and offer the slightest hint of a consolation. Inevitably, I would lose my dignity, yet again, and fall back into my role as the devoted shadow orbiting her world.

But this time, I was genuinely exhausted.

Later that evening, as I was leaving work, I saw her waiting by the main entrance.

She was wearing a sleek, form-fitting black dress that accentuated her figure, making her glow even in the dim twilight. Passing male doctors couldn't resist a second look, whispering amongst themselves.

In the past, I would have rushed over, desperate to shield her from their gazes. She had an innate quality that drew all eyes, and I was always afraid someone would snatch her away.

Now, I realized my fear wasn’t unfounded. I had just focused my efforts on guarding the wrong door.

Looking at her now, however, I felt nothing. No surge of desire, no wave of possessiveness. Just a profound, flat emptiness.

I walked straight past her, heading for home.

“Logan.” She called out my name.

“Dr. Spencer is hosting dinner tonight. You’re coming.”

For reasons I couldn't explain—perhaps sheer hunger—I agreed.

On the way, I kept catching a faint, familiar scent around her.

It was the specific, crisp, woody cologne Rhys always used.

“Since when do you wear cologne?” I asked abruptly.

She paused, slightly thrown. “I’m not wearing any.”

I didn’t say anything else. If she was telling the truth, the situation was even more bitterly ironic. It seemed they were so inseparable, their scents had merged.

The rest of the ride was silent. We arrived at the restaurant.

Dr. Spencer’s face lit up when he saw Genevieve.

“Genny! You finally made it.”

Then he saw me, and his smile froze instantly.

“What are you...”

He didn’t finish the sentence, but I knew what he was thinking.

Inside the private room, Spencer’s friends all turned to look at me. Their expressions varied, but the underlying sentiment was uniform: displeasure at my presence.

Dr. Spencer and Rhys Callahan were old medical school buddies. Since the day Genevieve introduced me as her partner, he’d openly resented me. He thought I was unworthy of her, just a general surgeon holding back the city’s youngest, brightest cardiothoracic specialist.

In the past, I had always tried to bridge the gap for Genevieve's sake, greeting him with a forced smile and trying to win him over, but to no avail. I always believed I was the one falling short. Now I saw the truth: they had always decided Rhys was the only one truly suitable for Genevieve.

I didn’t have to play that game anymore. I sat down in the furthest corner and pulled out my phone to review patient charts.

“Dr. Logan, over here.” Dr. Spencer insisted, guiding me to the most isolated seat before quickly ushering Genevieve over to where Rhys Callahan was already seated.

It was a deliberate gesture.

Rhys, immaculate in a tailored dark blue suit, flashed a brilliant, confident smile when Genevieve approached. They immediately started discussing a complex recent case, their heads close together in an intimate exchange.

Watching them laugh and talk, I was transported back to medical school, when I used to discuss cases with her. Back then, she would listen patiently to every one of my ideas, celebrating every correct clinical judgment I made.

Now, the light in her eyes was reserved for Rhys alone.

I stood up, ready to leave.

“Logan, you haven’t finished your meal,” Genevieve called out.

I gave a cold laugh. “Dr. Abbott, you and Dr. Callahan have plenty to discuss. I’ll excuse myself.”

I turned and walked out.

Behind me, I heard Dr. Spencer's voice, thick with passive-aggressive snark: “Dr. Logan is still so sensitive. No wonder Genny would...”

I stopped, turning back to face him.

“Dr. Spencer, my life is not your problem. You’d be better served focusing on your patient census, as a senior attending physician should.”

With that, I took large strides out of the room.

I knew the low whispers that followed. They were saying I was petty, unable to tolerate the happiness of my ex-wife and my former best friend.

But they would never know what I witnessed on our five-year anniversary night.

That night, on the hospital rooftop where I had set up a candlelight dinner, I saw Rhys take her hand and tell her, “You are the most brilliant, most dedicated doctor I’ve ever known.” And she, my wife, had allowed him to rest his head on her shoulder.

In that instant, I finally understood why she always sought Rhys out first for complex cases. Why she was always distracted when I tried to share my professional successes with her.

I was never the companion who could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with her in her mind. I was just a good, competent doctor. Rhys, however, was the genius who could create miracles with her on the operating table.

I drove back to my new apartment and opened the fridge. It was empty. I’d been so busy coordinating the job transfer, I hadn’t had time to stock up.

Just as I was about to order takeout, the doorbell rang.

Through the peephole, I saw Genevieve standing outside, holding two shopping bags.

I had no intention of opening the door, but then she produced a key.

Damn it. I forgot to demand the spare back.

She pushed the door open and walked straight to the kitchen.

“I figured you hadn’t eaten. I bought you some groceries.”

I watched her busy herself in my kitchen, a sense of the absurd washing over me.

“Genevieve, do you really find this game interesting?”

She stopped, turning to face me. “What game? You can’t function without eating, Logan.”

“I don’t need you to manage my well-being,” I said coldly. “Give me the key.”

She placed the key on the dining table but made no move to leave. “Logan, about tonight…”

“Stop,” I cut her off. “We’re divorced. You don’t owe me any explanation.”

Her eyes darkened. “Do you hate me that much?”

I laughed, a harsh, humorless sound. “Hate? Genevieve, you’re not worth the effort of hating.”

“You’re nothing but a liar. You’ve been deceiving me from the beginning.”

She suddenly grabbed my wrist. “When have I ever lied to you?”

“You and Rhys Callahan…”

“He’s just a colleague.”

“Is that so?” I sneered. “You two looked like more than colleagues on that rooftop.”

She froze. “You… you saw that?”

“And what if I did?” I yanked my hand free. “Genevieve, just go. I’m exhausted.”

She stood rooted to the spot. “Logan, let me explain…”

“I don’t need an explanation.”

I cut her off again. “You two are a perfect match. I’m giving you my blessing.”

“You…”

“Dr. Abbott,” I switched to a cold, professional tone. “We have an early start tomorrow. Please go home and rest.”

She stared at me, her expression unreadable, before finally turning and leaving.

The moment the door shut, I slid down the wall and sank onto the floor.

Tears, hot and uncontrollable, began to stream down my face. I hated myself for still being capable of this pain.

The next morning, I went to the hospital for rounds as usual.

As soon as I got to my office, I overheard that Genevieve was taking Rhys Callahan to a major international medical conference.

I forced myself to focus on patient charts, but the discussions outside my glass-walled office were impossible to ignore.

“I hear Dr. Abbott personally secured that slot for Dr. Callahan…”

“Yeah, it’s a top-tier global summit…”

“They really are meant to be. A genuine power couple…”

I slammed the chart shut and headed for the ER. Busy hands, I knew from years of practice, were the only cure for a troubled mind.

I was treating a trauma patient from a car accident when a nurse rushed in. “Dr. Logan, critical patient in the ICU. They need a consult, stat.”

I hurried to the Intensive Care Unit. Genevieve and Rhys were already there.

“I thought you were heading to the conference?” I asked instinctively.

Genevieve looked up. “It was postponed.”

Rhys offered a smug smile. “Genny said work takes priority.”

Ignoring his unnecessary commentary, I moved to the bedside to assess the patient.

“We need to operate immediately,” I declared.

Genevieve nodded. “My thoughts exactly.”

“Prep the room.”

She suddenly looked at me. “You’ll scrub in to lead the case.”

I was stunned. This was a highly complex cardiothoracic case, her specialty.

Rhys immediately objected. “Genny, this surgery is…”

“Dr. Logan’s surgical capabilities are well-known,” she cut him off.

I gave a cold laugh. “No need. This is a cardiothoracic case; you two should handle it.”

I started to walk away, but she stopped me. “You have to do this surgery.”

I turned back, meeting the sincerity in her eyes. In that moment, I thought I understood.

“Dr. Abbott, do you think this proves something?”

“I’m simply choosing the most qualified physician,” she insisted.

I scoffed. “The most qualified? Genevieve, do you seriously expect me to believe that?”

“Didn’t you always believe my skills weren’t a match for yours? What is this supposed to be?”

She frowned. “I never said that…”

“Save it.” I interrupted her. “I won’t take the case.”

I walked out.

Behind me, I heard Rhys's triumphant voice: “Genny, I’ll take the lead on this one.”

I walked faster, determined to block out any further sound.
