Seeing me return, people mocked even louder.

The next moment, a waiter looked at me disdainfully, "Miss Lily, while you were away, several gentlemen have already placed bids. The current highest bid is two million. Are you in or out?"

I looked at the big screen. This photo was of me fighting with pigs for food. Because I refused to submit, that family starved me.

After Uncle Jack brought me back, he once cried in front of me, vowing never to let me suffer again.

I closed my eyes, swallowing the tears in my heart, and said hoarsely, "I'll place a bid."

As soon as I finished speaking, Jack laughed coldly, "Lily, when it's your turn, you're not selfish anymore?"

"Since you want to bid, let's add a few videos to the mix."

Instantly, the big screen displayed a video. I watched in horror as the scene unfolded.

It was a shadow I never wanted to touch in my life.

In the video, I was pinned down by two men, with another man violating me.

I was screaming in pain, like a lone beast fighting alone.

I was so scared that I fell to my knees, hugging my head and shaking.

Jack reflexively took a step towards me but was quickly pulled back by Bella.

"Uncle, don't provoke my sister anymore. She seems to be having an episode. Although my sister doesn't like me, and even caused... that incident, I believe she didn't mean to."

Jack immediately stopped in his tracks, as if awakening from a trance.

"She deserves it."

I slowly raised my head and looked at Jack again.

He clearly knew I had depression, yet he still chose to provoke me like this.

The waiter ignored me and smiled at the crowd again, "Next is the second photo, a full-body nude. Starting bid is 5.2 million."

I looked at the image on the screen in horror. How did Jack have this photo? He had ordered these photos deleted when he rescued me.

But Bella's words instantly solved my confusion.

"Uncle, I just wanted to see some photos of my sister in the mountains, and you actually spent a whole week recovering these high-resolution images. I don't know what to say."

Jack still hugged Bella affectionately, "Bella, I'll give you anything you want."

The young ladies present looked at this scene with envy or jealousy.

"You had these photos recovered?"

Jack just smirked, his eyes filled with amusement.

"Just because I didn't bid on Bella's photo?"

Jack only reacted when he heard this name. His sharp gaze cut into my heart like a knife.

I watched bitterly as Jack turned to hold Bella's hand tenderly.

That big hand once firmly held mine as we crossed mountain after mountain.

I always thought he was my real uncle.

Until that night when I turned eighteen, he burst into my room.

After that wild night, I realized he had no blood relation to me.

But after that night, he never mentioned it again.

He gradually became indifferent towards me.
