Jack looked at me without emotion and walked towards me, letting go of Bella's hand.
But he asked me to hand over the black card he had given me before.
"I've decided to give that black card to Bella as a gift."
Before I could speak, he signaled with his eyes, and the next moment, a waiter searched me in front of everyone on the ship and handed the cards I was carrying to Jack.
Jack held up two cards and looked at them, saying flatly, "They're dirty. Destroy them."
He then walked back to Bella, taking out a brand new card from his pocket and handing it to her.
"I wouldn't let Bella use something dirty that someone else has used."
Instantly, my heart felt as if it had been pierced by a thousand arrows.
I could barely stand, swaying as I stood at the stern of the ship.
The waiter's voice rang out again, enjoying the show, "This photo's bidding price is 3 million. Additionally, the winner can specify one thing for the person in the photo to do."
With these words, the whole place erupted. Those men with green eyes in their sockets looked like they wanted to strip me naked with their gazes!
"So, can we make Lily perform a striptease right here?"
Unexpectedly, Jack sneered, his words seeming to nail me to a pillar of shame, "It's not like she hasn't done it before."
"Damn, who knew Lily was such a wild one under that country bumpkin appearance. Did she learn all this while servicing people in the mountains?"
I had indeed danced for Jack before. It was his birthday, and I didn't know it was called a striptease. I only knew that if I danced, those people wouldn't beat me and might even give me food.
But after I danced for Jack that time, he was so heartbroken he almost punched himself. He solemnly told me, "You must never dance in front of anyone again."
I remembered, but he forgot!
When I came back to my senses, the bidding price had already reached 5 million.
"Uncle, look how upset my sister is. She's about to cry but can't. She probably has no money left. Why don't we call it off? I really can't bear to see this."
"Bella, I know you're kind-hearted, but your kindness towards enemies is hurting yourself."
Jack brought his business tactics to educate Bella, as if I were some unforgivable villain.
I could barely control my swaying body. So in Jack's heart, I had already been classified as an enemy?
"Alright, Mr. Huang's highest bid is now 5 million. Is there anyone else? 5 million once, 5 million twice, then..."
I directly interrupted, my heart as dead as ashes, uttering three words, "I'll place a bid."
But now everyone knew I had no money left. They didn't buy it, "Lily, you country bumpkin, do you know the rules? If you bid without money, you're disrupting order. You'll not only go bankrupt but also have to compensate everyone present."
Another sneer was heard, "Why are you explaining to her? This idiot wouldn't understand. Besides, talking about bankruptcy, I think she's already bankrupt now, isn't she?"
But I ignored their words and insisted on speaking again: "I'll place a bid."
Seeing my stubborn appearance, Jack felt a surge of anger in his chest, "Don't let her fool you. How about this, whoever wins the bid, I'll throw in several sets of exclusive premium photoshoots."
The next moment, he snapped his fingers, and the screen displayed various nude photos of me, some in a dark basement, some in fields, and some even in pigsties.
People got more excited with their bids, quickly reaching 10 million.
But at this moment, Jack suddenly spoke up to bid, "13.14 million."
