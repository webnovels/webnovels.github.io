Spencer and I applied for the same top-tier Master’s program. We were both aiming for a spot under Dr. Sofia Ramirez, the most sought-after advisor in our field.
But she only had one spot left.
I hesitated, the familiar guilt tightening in my chest. “If I get it, will it crush Spencer?”
My family laughed it off, a wave of dismissive confidence. “It’s based on merit, Caden. Don’t hold back. Just do your best. “You’re both Albright sons. We’ll be happy no matter who gets in.”
But on the day of my final interview, I watched as my adopted brother, Spencer, laid his cards on the table.
He didn’t just submit a recommendation letter; he submitted a personal note from our mother, Dr. Eleanor Albright—the industry titan. “Mom said if you take me, she’ll personally vote to fast-track your next professional promotion, Dr. Ramirez.”
Then, my CEO father, Jonathan Albright, called the department head directly. “Take Spencer Albright, and I’ll fund your research project with a ninety-million-dollar endowment.”
My A-list actress sister, Quinn, sent a video message to Dr. Ramirez’s personal assistant. “Choose Spencer, and I’ll recommend your daughter for the lead role in my next prestige series.”
My pop-star sister, Scarlett, went even further, sending two exclusive VIP passes to her sold-out stadium tour. “If you take my brother, I’ll personally mentor your son and get his foot in the door.”
Spencer looked at Dr. Ramirez, his eyes bright with victory and a carefully calibrated smugness. “They also said, Professor, that if you choose Caden instead of me, all those promises? They’ll do the exact opposite.”
I watched the triumph blooming in Spencer’s features, and the blatant, nauseating display of my family’s collective bribery.
I stood up. I leaned in, and I whispered just one sentence into the ear of the professor who was already reaching for Spencer’s file.
Dr. Ramirez, poised to select Spencer, instantly spun around and pointed straight at me.
“I apologize,” she declared, her voice ringing with sudden resolve. “I choose him.”

Spencer thought he hadn’t heard correctly. “Professor, who did you just choose?”
Dr. Ramirez was definitive. “Caden Albright. Your older brother, Spencer.”
Spencer bolted out of his chair, pointing frantically at the desk. The recommendation letter, the endowment papers, the VIP passes. “Professor, did you not see any of this? That letter is hand-signed by my mother!”
“I saw it,” Dr. Ramirez said, calmly returning the letter to its envelope. “But the decision of who to mentor belongs solely to me. I choose Caden.”
Spencer’s jaw locked. “Do you truly believe my family won’t make you regret this?”
Dr. Ramirez hesitated.
Everyone knew the Albrights were people of their word—for better or worse. The biotech CEO father. The industry-leading mother. The A-list actress sister. The chart-topping singer sister. They were vindictive, tenacious, and terrifyingly powerful. Any one of them could make life miserable for a university professor.
More than that, Dr. Ramirez’s own children could be caught in the crossfire.
But she still sighed, a deep, steadying breath. “I’m sorry. My decision is final.”
Spencer was incredulous. His eyes, rimmed with hurt, swung to me.
I stood beside Dr. Ramirez, meeting his gaze with a cold, unwavering stare.
He turned heel, slammed the door, and was gone.
Once the sound of his angry footsteps had faded, Dr. Ramirez turned to me, her knees buckling as if to fall.
I quickly steadied her. “Dr. Ramirez, please, don’t!”
“You’re a miracle worker,” she pleaded, her voice choked with emotion. “Please, Caden, you have to save my father!”

Just moments ago, I had leaned over and whispered: “Is your father dealing with a persistent, hacking cough? Does he consistently wake up at three in the morning? And did he travel to Southeast Asia exactly one month ago?”
Dr. Ramirez had kept all those details—the exact symptoms, the specific travel location, the time of the nocturnal wake-up—completely private. Multiple doctors had failed to diagnose the issue. She had suspected a tropical pathogen or something worse, but as a respected academic, she couldn't dare voice her deepest fears about a curse or a spiritual attachment.
But I had articulated every minute detail.
I let out a slow sigh. “Don't worry, Professor. It’s a small problem.”

A week later, the warmth returned to Dr. Ramirez’s face. Her father was well, the ominous cough gone.
She had zero regrets about accepting me, even knowing the consequences of crossing my adoptive family. Now, she understood everything.
The fate of every Albright had been fundamentally broken.
My mother, the industry leader, was initially destined for obscurity and to die of a broken spirit. My father, the CEO, was fated to be perpetually broke, struggling just to stay above water. My sister Quinn, the actress, was meant to suffer a horrific accident that would disfigure her and end her career prematurely. And my sister Scarlett, the singer, was born to be deaf and mute, dying young.
I was the exception. I was born with a gift—a natural-born spiritual anchor.
I saw their doomed fates and quietly adjusted the energetic architecture of our home. It was a subtle, constant manipulation: lifting Mom’s career higher, filling Dad’s coffers, safeguarding Quinn’s face, and granting Scarlett a voice like velvet.
But I was forbidden to ever speak of it. Revealing the truth would instantly strip me of my abilities.
They were kind to me, in the beginning. The money I earned from odd jobs and small projects I funneled back into the family, and they did use some of their wealth to raise me.
Then Spencer arrived. He was the orphan of my parents’ dear friends.
The funds allocated for me dwindled. Soon, I had to formally request even ten dollars from Mom and Dad.
They would wipe away my tears and say, “Spencer has no one. He is entirely dependent on us. Besides, if we don’t favor him, people will say we’re biased toward our own. Caden, you have to consider the family image.”
So, I stopped crying. I watched them elevate Spencer, piece by piece. Since he was the descendant of a revered old-school artist, the Albright name gained enormous cultural prestige by adopting him.
I celebrated their success silently, constantly working in the shadows to maintain the energetic balance that kept them safe.
But when I got home from the interview, the atmosphere felt wrong. Quinn and Scarlett, who rarely visited, were both there.
Spencer was on the sofa, his eyes red-rimmed and dramatically wounded.
Quinn grabbed my wrist in a vice grip. “Do you have any idea how long Spencer has been planning this Master’s program? Why are you always so difficult, always trying to snatch things from him?”
She yanked me toward the attic door, shoving me inside. “Stay in here and think about what you did. You can come out when Spencer forgives you.”
The cold, damp energy immediately rushed up to meet me. I desperately lunged for the door, trying to stop her from locking it.
But Quinn was faster. Click. The deadbolt slid home.
“Don’t lock me in, Quinn! I’m scared!”
She knew. When I was five, I’d accidentally gotten locked in the attic. When she finally found me, I was burning with fever and nearly died. She’d sobbed, holding me, swearing repeatedly that she was a terrible sister and promising to never let me near that dark, terrifying space again. Once we got rich, she’d even paid a maid to guard the attic entrance just in case I wandered in.
Now, for her new brother, she had shoved me in herself.
What I’d never told her was that when I was five, it wasn’t an accident. The attic was the spiritual "sewer" of the house—where I locked up all the toxic energy and accumulated bad luck to keep the family’s good fortune flowing. The trapped, resentful energies had drawn me in and savagely retaliated.
Those dark forces had not dissipated.
“If you’re going to steal from your little brother, you need to understand the consequences,” Quinn’s voice was cold on the other side of the door. “You’re an adult now. A little attic can’t hurt you.”
“No! Quinn! Please, don’t!”
Her footsteps faded. The air behind me grew thick and heavy with concentrated spiritual grime. I couldn't dare turn around.
A shadow flickered at the bottom of the door.
My eyes lit up. “Scarlett!”
Scarlett looked through the narrow gap, a slight frown on her perfect face.
“Scarlett! Do me a favor! Go get the protective sandalwood charm from my room, okay?”
She nodded. And left.
A moment later, she was back, holding the charm.
I was nearly weeping with relief. Maybe this sister, the one I’d protected for twenty years, still cared.
“Is this it?”
The small, hand-carved sandalwood charm dangled in front of my face. I reached for it, desperately hoping she would slide it under the door.
But then: CRACK!
She snapped the charm clean in half. The protective amulet that had shielded me for two decades was mercilessly broken.
“Scarlett!” I screamed, a raw, insane sound.
She dropped the pieces on the dusty floor. “You’re genuinely pathetic, Caden. You’re this old and you’re still trying to steal from Spencer? Quinn and I have real talent. We made it on our own. We don't need whatever garbage you’re fiddling with. Who knows what black magic you used to get that spot over Spencer. Breaking this is probably for the best.”
She turned to leave.
“Scarlett! Scarlett, come back! I could actually die in here!”
Shrieks and agonized cries echoed from the dark attic. My desperate screams were deafening.
But downstairs, I heard music start up, drowning out my misery.
I don’t know when the music stopped. I only remember slumping against the door, my body weak and shivering.
The door cracked open a tiny bit. Mom and Dad looked in.
“Caden, are you okay?”
“Dad! Mom! Get me out! Please!” I clawed at the doorframe, tears streaming. The spiritual toxins were invisible to them, but they were driving me to the brink of collapse.
My parents exchanged a look, and I thought I saw a flicker of pity.
“We’ll get the key.”
They left.
I waited and waited. It was dark before anyone returned.
The maid Quinn had stationed outside the door stood there. I looked at her with wide, pleading eyes. “Where are Mom and Dad?”
“Don’t bother, Mr. Caden. Young Master Spencer was very upset. The Mister and Missus, along with the two young ladies, were unable to console him. They’ve already left for a vacation in the Bahamas.”
“What did you say?”
My hands, clinging to the doorframe, slid down to the floor.
They had forgotten me.
I didn't know if I could survive the night.

Dr. Ramirez was the one who kicked the door down and pulled me out.
I spent a day and a night in the hospital, recovering, before I could finally open my eyes.
Dr. Ramirez squeezed my hand, thanking me profusely. “You told me to keep my younger child home yesterday, and you were right—the exact spot she was supposed to be at collapsed! You saved my family’s life again! I couldn’t reach you yesterday, and I had a terrible feeling. I should have trusted my gut…”
She clenched her jaw. When the attic door finally opened, even the maid Quinn had hired gasped in horror at my state.
My phone pinged. A new post from Spencer.
The background was exactly the white sands of the Bahamas. Spencer, in stylish summer wear and expensive sunglasses, was grinning and throwing up a peace sign. My sisters were flanking him, making heart shapes with their hands. Mom and Dad looked on, faces filled with doting adoration.
The caption read:
[Why would I ever be upset? With a loving family like mine, I’ll never feel anything but cherished.]
Dr. Ramirez sighed. “I know I sometimes get caught up in my two kids, but this level of favoritism is beyond belief!”
I put the phone down, my fists tight. “Since they value Spencer so much, I’m going to make sure the one they’ve so carefully protected becomes my ultimate failure.”

It wasn’t long before my mother called me into the study room.
“I hear you’re applying for the National Science Advancement Award, the same one Spencer is going for?”
I nodded.
“Withdraw your application. Spencer needs this award to qualify for a more prestigious national fellowship.”
“I want to apply for it too.”
Mom frowned. “You have other academic achievements you can use, Caden. Why are you so fixated on this one?”
I looked straight at her. “Because this award is the most significant competitive edge in the field. Mom, you’re afraid of me blocking Spencer’s path. But even if I withdraw, do you think every other candidate will just hand him the prize? It’s a contest of merit.”
“Nonsense!” She slapped her palm on the desk. “I understand merit! But I absolutely refuse to have you, my own son, stand in opposition to Spencer!”
I froze.
“Caden, you’re Spencer’s older brother. If you stand against him, he’ll be hurt.”
A bitter, wrenching laugh escaped me. “Mom, are you truly worried about him? Or are you worried about your own standing?”
She paled.
“Spencer is the descendant of a revered artist, your late friend’s orphan. Everyone in the industry knows. If he shines, the world sees you as the noble, generous savior—the one who deserves to be held in the same esteem as that late artist. You think I haven’t figured that out?”
Mom’s face was chalk white.
I’d overheard them recently. Mom and Dad, consulting in the study. I heard my father’s sigh. “This will be unfair to Caden, but it will bring the Albright name so much more prestige.”
I smiled bitterly. “Prestige. That’s all it ever is. Is giving the four of you a chance to shine worth sacrificing my entire life? Am I not your son? Am I not Quinn and Scarlett’s brother?”
“Slap!”
A stinging blow landed across my face, unexpected and vicious.
Mom looked at me with incomprehension and disgust. “What ridiculous garbage are you spouting?”
She grabbed her handbag and stormed out, looking both furious and like she was running away. “You truly are an ungrateful wretch!”

Dr. Ramirez was officially warned by my parents, but she ignored them. She threw herself into helping me secure the Science Advancement Award.
However, soon after, our lab equipment suppliers collectively and suddenly backed out of their contracts. Without the right gear, our research was impossible, and the application was dead in the water.
Dr. Ramirez used every contact she had to borrow what we needed. But the next day, those colleagues and friends sheepishly returned and took their equipment back. Several even cut off contact.
One of Dr. Ramirez’s close friends stammered out a hint: “It’s not what we want to do, but there’s a major corporate investor who’s made it clear… you know, the one who funds a lot of our key projects…” He gave her a meaningful look. ‘You get it?’
Dr. Ramirez and I silently made way for them.
Only one person had the financial clout to cripple nearly every collaborative project in the area.
My father, Jonathan Albright.
I clenched my fists. “It’s fine. We’ll build our own.”
Dr. Ramirez and I sourced components ourselves. Within a month, the custom rig was nearly complete.
The day I got my breakthrough data, I posted an innocuous photo of the results on my private feed.
My mother called instantly. “Do you really have to fight your family—fight Spencer—like this?”
Before I could answer, I heard Scarlett’s voice from the background. “Spencer failed his experiment and hasn’t eaten all day! Why are you so vile, always taking what belongs to others!”
I hung up without a word.
Mom called back, her voice tight. “Caden! Withdraw the application. Delete the post. Do you hear me?”
I pressed the ‘End Call’ button.
But the next day, Mom showed up at the university.
Everyone was stunned. “Is that Dr. Albright? The Dr. Albright, the industry titan? I heard she won’t even step foot on an Ivy League campus! Why is she here, at our small local school?”
“Oh my God, she’s my idol! I got into this program because of her! I need an autograph!”
I stood in the crowd, watching my mother in genuine shock. Spencer was right beside her, and the two of them commanded all the attention.
Her eyes met mine. Her expression instantly cooled, and she quickly looked away.
The award selection was held shortly after her “inspection.” My findings were the most innovative and academically sound.
Yet, I was rejected. I didn’t even qualify for an honorable mention.
Dr. Ramirez sighed heavily. “Turns out Dr. Albright brought Spencer and the judges to a private dinner when she was here. She’s an industry titan, Caden. No one wants to risk crossing her.”
The realization hit me hard.
I smiled, a painful twist of my mouth.
On the walk back to the dorms, several cars suddenly blocked my path.
“You’re the actress Quinn’s little brother, right?”
“Look who we have here. Are you the one who ruined Scarlett’s last live stream?”
I was completely confused.
Someone shoved a phone in my face. It was a clip of Quinn’s recent interview. When asked about her private life, she’d paused, sighing dramatically: “Oh, you know… my younger brother. He’s causing trouble again, making things difficult. My headaches are back. Otherwise, things are fine.”
Next was a clip from a music awards ceremony where Scarlett had noticeably missed a note. In a post-performance interview, she’d sighed: “There’s been some family drama lately. My brother, you know… well, I shouldn’t make excuses. Missing that note was my fault, and I apologize to my fans.”
Scarlett never missed a note.
My sisters were deliberately signaling to their massive fan bases—painting me as the troubled, difficult sibling.
Now, their combined fans were surrounding me.
“A big deal, aren’t you? Causing the A-list actress and the pop star to both look upset?”
“Honestly, you’re just not as good as Spencer. Why is that so hard for you to understand?”
“Your family might spoil you, but we fans won’t tolerate your spoiled behavior, rich boy!”
Someone grabbed my collar. I tried to turn and run.
Another person tripped me.
I fell face-first onto the pavement. A sharp, brutal punch landed squarely on my cheek.
Through the window of a Rolls-Royce, stopped at the red light, I saw Quinn and Scarlett’s startled faces.
I screamed, “Quinn! Scarlett! Help me!”
The light turned green.
They exchanged a quick look.
And the tinted window slid up.
“You little leech! You think you can bother our sisters?”
“Let’s teach you how to behave, you spoiled brat!”

A few kind strangers intervened and pulled them off me.
On the walk home, my clothes were shredded. My shoes were gone, and every step left a bloody print on the sidewalk.
“Whose kid is that? Looks like a lunatic.”
“Kids today are crazy. Walking around like that.”
I pushed open the door to the house.
Everyone turned to look at me. A massive, professionally tiered cake sat on the dining table.
Oh. Right. It was Spencer’s birthday.
“You come home looking like that? Did you know it was Spencer’s party and decide to deliberately start a fight?”
I looked at the cold, judgmental faces of my parents and my sisters.
I smiled, a wide, unsettling grin.
I kicked the spiritual mirror, the one that kept the house’s energy clean, sending shards everywhere.
I grabbed the lucky money-tree plant and violently ripped it out of its pot.
I took the cake knife and slashed the red, braided safety rope hanging on the wall—the one that had guarded their lives.
“Caden Albright, are you insane!”
My eyes were red, hot, and wild as I spun to face them.
“Go to hell. All of you.”
