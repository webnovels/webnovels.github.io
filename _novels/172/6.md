My nails dug into my palm. I looked at this man I've loved and hated for seven years

. My throat tightened, and despite opening my mouth several times, no sound came out. Until the tenth time, I finally spoke, my voice trembling and choking, "Asher, that's my heart! I'll die."

"Then just die." Asher didn't even bother to look at me, casually throwing out his words: "Stop pretending." "You won't die, and this heart is what you owe Beatrix."

"If you hadn't focused on saving me and not saved Beatrix," "She wouldn't have stayed in the rain so long and gotten sick."

"If you hadn't used the fact you saved me to force me to marry you,"

"How would Beatrix have gotten so agitated and triggered a heart condition?!"

But to save you, I was bled dry, to death! How could I save Beatrix?

Marrying me was your own idea to show your grandfather you valued emotions to fight for inheritance! How is it all my fault?
