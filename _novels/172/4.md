"Asher." In my daze, I seemed to hear Asher's voice. I got up in joy and followed it. In the next room, I saw him and also…

Beatrix. Asher's adopted sister, the cherished white moonlight he didn't dare to touch. He was reading her a story with a tenderness I had never seen. Before marrying Asher, our relationship wasn't this horrible

Once, I got stabbed 18 times saving Asher, feeling my blood drain futilely on a rainy night until death. Since then, I feared every rainy night, often crying and begging him to stay with me for a while, but he always refused.

Let alone reading a story so gently.

The voice stopped, and Asher looked at the sleeping Beatrix, suppressing his feelings for a long time, but he couldn't help leaning in, leaving a kiss on her lips: "Beatrix, wait for me."

"I'll soon make Adeline repay you with her heart."
