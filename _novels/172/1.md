"Help!"

"Ah!"

"Run!"

The horse's high hooves and Asher's indifferent back descended together, one tearing at my body, the other shattering my heart.

I lay on the ground, trampled repeatedly by the frenzied horse, blood surging from my broken organs, pouring from my mouth, ears, and nose.

The cries and screams of the crowd mixed with the horse's frantic neighs, pounding in my ears, making me dizzy. Despite the pain and despair, I suddenly wanted to laugh at my own foolishness. Yesterday, when Asher suddenly invited me to the zoo, I foolishly thought...

He finally wanted to accept me. But it was just a crueler way to die, trampled by a mad horse!

Asher, this is truly a painful enough death to make me give up!
