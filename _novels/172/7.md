Bitter tears seeped into my heart, leaving me powerless. I could only shake my head, "It's not me, it's not me." Asher remained focused on his phone, a smile I've never seen on his lips.

He played a voice message, and a soft voice on the other end cooed, "Brother, where are you? Beatrix misses you." He replied gently, "Beatrix, be good, brother is coming back soon."

Then, he turned off his phone, his face cold towards me, "Adeline, are you refusing a toast only to be forced to drink?"

"Come, pin her down and make her sign." At his command, the bodyguards swarmed in, forcibly holding my hand to sign the donation agreement.

In the chaos, inappropriate hands even slipped under my clothes, touching my chest, reaching between my legs. The disgusting, sticky sensation of so many hands made me want to vomit.

I struggled desperately, "What are you doing?!" "Let me go!" "Let me go, no!"

I was back in that alley from seven years ago, a crack opened in my heart, tearing wider.

Desperate, I reached out: "Asher, Asher, save me!" But Asher just stood there coldly watching, suddenly kicking the bed, cursing, "Slut."

"Can you not be without a man for even a moment?!" He turned away in disgust, "Hurry up, and give me the donation agreement later."
