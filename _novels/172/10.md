The room was turned into an iron cage, and I was drugged daily, muddled, waiting for death on the bed. "Adeline, now you know how it feels."

"Don't blame me for being ruthless, blame yourself for being cheap! For taking my brother away."

This voice was Beatrix! "I can't leave brother, I'll die without him." "So… I can only let you die."

Beatrix laughed softly, then added, "Actually, I don't have a heart condition at all."

"Inject her with drugs every day."

"Before the surgery, let her stay in bed in a vegetative state."

The hospital room felt like an iron cage. Every day, I was drugged, lying there, waiting for death.

"Adeline, it's your turn now."

"Don't blame me for being cruel. Blame yourself for foolishly taking my Brother."

It was Beatrix's voice!

"I can't live without Brother. Without him, I'll die."

"So... I have no choice but to let you die."

Beatrix chuckled, "Actually, I don't have a heart condition."

"I bribed the doctor to say I did, just so Brother would give me your heart, leading to your death!"

My breathing quickened. She never had a heart condition! It was all a lie to deceive Asher! I must tell Asher!!!

"You’re awake?!"

Beatrix noticed my reaction, exclaiming in surprise. I tried to control my emotions, pretending to know nothing.

Beatrix examined me closely, "Is she... not awake?"

"Hmph."

Beatrix's eyes darkened, "Whether you're awake or not, as long as you die, that's what matters."

"You're going to die anyway, whether sooner or later makes no difference."

"Let me help you leave this world a bit earlier."

She laughed, "An early death means an early rebirth!"

The room's temperature began to rise. She intended to burn me! I suddenly realized her plan. I wanted to run, to scream, but the drugs left me paralyzed.

The heat intensified, scorching my body. I rolled off the bed; the door was only ten meters away, but it felt like an unreachable distance. I clawed toward it with all my might, leaving scratch marks on the iron.

Bloodstains crisscrossed the floor, accompanied by the smell of burning flesh. My skin peeled off as I crawled, my dying cries echoing—someone, save me, help me!

The pain was unbearable! Save me! Save me!!!

In my final moments, I heard Asher's voice: "Quick! Save her!!!"

He sounded frantic. Was it for me?

"Brother."

"My heart hurts."

Beatrix frowned, clutching her chest.

"What?!"

Asher panicked, immediately scooping up Beatrix, "Everyone, clear the route to the nearest hospital!"

"What about Mrs.?"

He turned sharply, our eyes meeting across the hospital room.

"Brother!"

Beatrix clung to his hand, crying, "It hurts so much!"

Asher hesitated no more, carrying Beatrix out: "Forget her, she won't die!"

Beatrix clutched her chest, crying, "Brother, I actually caused Sister Adeline's accident."

She lowered her head, voice choked, "I wanted to have a candlelight dinner with Brother, but accidentally knocked over the candle."

"Brother, am I stupid?"

"You can scold me, hit me."

She clung to Asher's sleeve, pleading, "Just don't leave me!"

No, she did it on purpose to burn me!

Asher comforted her, "It's okay, don't be afraid, Beatrix."

"It's not your fault; maybe it's Adeline's karma."

......

Their voices faded away, leaving me to be consumed by the fire.

Karma?

I wanted to laugh but had no strength to move. I wanted to cry, but tears had long run dry for Asher.

David said a person dies three times in life. I had died seven times for Asher. I should let go.

Memories flashed through my mind, those unforgettable moments fading away.

Asher, I don't love you anymore.

System: "Calculating the male lead's malice value..."

With that, I fell into nothingness.

On the first day of Adeline's death, Asher was busy consoling the frightened Beatrix.

On the second day, Asher took Beatrix on a Ferris wheel ride.

On the third day, Asher frowned. Adeline used to return to him within three days.

On the fourth day, Asher carved a bunny out of an apple for Beatrix, remembering how he used to cheer up Adeline with it.

On the fifth day, Asher felt a void in his heart. He told himself, she loved you too much to leave!

On the sixth day, Asher saw Adeline’s figure everywhere in a daze.

Asher panicked.

He kept asking his subordinates, "Has Adeline been here?"

Asher kicked over everything in front of him, "Where is Adeline?!"

"Where is she?"

"Hurry, find her for me!"

"But... Mr. He, Mrs. already died in that fire!"

Asher froze in shock.

Adeline, dead?!

"Shut up!!!"

He glared at the speaker, "Impossible! She can't be dead!"

"She can't be dead!!!"

Asher went mad.

He started searching for me everywhere, turning over every inch of land.

But it was too late.

Asher searched for an entire month but never found me.

After drinking a whole case of liquor, he returned once more to the place where I was burned to death.

The sight of charred ruins struck Asher’s heart.

"Adeline!"

He stumbled inside, frantically digging through the rubble, "Adeline, I didn't allow you to die!"

"You’re not allowed to die!"

He searched all night until dawn finally unearthed a decayed corpse.

The rotting body had been burnt to a crisp, covered in dark red blood stains.

The stench was overwhelming, but Asher felt nothing.

He held the corpse tightly, tears streaming down his face, "Adeline, Adeline, I was wrong."

"I'm sorry, please come back?!"

"I'm begging you, if you come back,"

"I'll do anything."

"Really? What if I want you all dead?"

As a corpse, I grinned.

One minute earlier.

System: "Male lead's malice value calculation complete, reaching 100%"

"You may unbind from the CEO's trophy wife status and select a new identity."

"Available identities: A CEO's stepmother; B switch identities to become CEO; C return to your body as the corpse queen."

"Please choose."

Remembering the agony of my blood being drained in the rain,

The pain of being tortured to death,

The agony of being trampled to death by horses,

......

And being burned to death in the fire,

I want Asher, Beatrix, and everyone who hurt me,

To face retribution!

With a plan in mind,

I smiled and said, "I want them all."
