I was pinned down like a dog or pig, while Asher was telling jokes to make Beatrix laugh. Beatrix giggled cutely, then said, "By the way, brother."

"Is Adeline really willing to give me her heart?" "She won't pretend to agree and then run away on the surgery day, will she?!"

Beatrix sobbed a bit, "Brother, if Adeline runs, won't I die on the operating table?" "I'm scared!"

Asher hugged her gently, "She won't." So, he ordered his men, "Seal Adeline's room completely with iron." "Give her a shot every day." "Before the surgery, let her lie on the bed like a vegetable."
