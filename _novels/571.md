The day the cruise ship sank, raging fire and thick smoke billowed.

Everyone fought frantically for the last lifeboat spot.

I clung to the railing, my knuckles white, but Seraphina, right beside me, acted as if I wasn't even there.

She frantically searched through the crowd for my younger brother, Caleb Stone.

Finally, she shielded him in her arms and pushed him onto the lifeboat.

When she looked back at me, the tenderness in her eyes vanished.

“Caleb isn’t mentally stable; he can’t handle this.”

“But I’m your therapist. I know your willpower—it’s incredibly strong.”

She promised, “Once he’s settled, I’ll be right back for you.”

But even as the ship exploded, and I was dragged into the icy waves, my mind fading, before I completely sank, her figure never appeared.

Years later, we met again. Seraphina looked at the child I was holding, her eyes blazing red as she gripped my wrist.

“I told you to wait for me! How dare you have a child with another woman?!”
