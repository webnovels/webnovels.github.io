Grayish-white powder spilled across the floor. A staff member nearby immediately shrieked.

“Hey! What are you doing?!”

People who were at the crematorium to handle arrangements for their deceased family members quickly backed away.

“Is that person crazy? Why are they scattering ashes on the ground?”

“They must be sick. Don’t they know that’s bad luck? How unlucky!”

“Did something trigger them? Never mind, I’ll just stay away.”

Everyone murmured, pointing at me, their gazes unfriendly.

I expressionlessly kicked the "ashes" on the ground.

“Look closely, everyone. Are these really human ashes?”

At my words, everyone’s gaze fell to the ground.

“It does look a bit strange. Why aren’t there any small pieces or fragments of bone?”

“Now that you mention it, you’re right. Cremation can’t turn all bones into dust.”

I curved my lips into a slight smile and said loudly to the staff member, “Don’t you think you owe me an explanation?”

“The crematorium staff gave me fake ashes? Do you have any professional ethics left?”

“There are so many bereaved families here. Does this mean the ashes they received are also fake?”

At my series of questions, many family members’ faces turned ugly.

The staff member anxiously said, “Don’t talk nonsense! We follow all procedures!”

I pressed on. “Is that really true? Derek was declared dead at the hospital just two hours ago. How could his body have been successfully cremated two hours later? When did your efficiency become so high?”

The crowd instantly erupted.

“What? Two hours?!”

“Are you insane?! I thought handling everything for my loved one was fast, and it still took a full day. How could it be cremated in two hours?”

“No wonder the powder on the ground didn’t look like ashes. There really *is* something fishy going on!”

Under the barrage of questions from the crowd, the staff member stammered nervously, completely flustered.

He never imagined I would scatter the ashes in public and then question the cremation time.

He managed to appease the crowd with a few hurried words, then rushed inside.

A moment later, he walked up to me, his face plastered with a forced smile.

“My apologies, we had a mistake in our work. The ashes we just gave you belonged to someone else. Your friend’s body is still undergoing cremation. Please wait a bit longer.”

Several hours later, the staff member brought me another urn.

And the female doctor from the hospital suddenly appeared at the crematorium.

“Mr. Hayes, before Mr. Miller passed, he instructed me to ensure his child was given to you to raise. This was his dying wish, and you must fulfill it.”

“You were the best of brothers in life, so now that he’s gone, his child is your child.”

“Also, here are his life savings, a total of fifty thousand dollars. He hopes you will raise his child well.”

Her words were grand and righteous. She then thrust the baby and the bank card into my arms. The onlookers, unaware of the full story, were deeply moved and applauded me.

I looked down at the child and let out a soft laugh.

Derek, you *really* want me to raise your child, don’t you?

Then I'll grant your wish.
