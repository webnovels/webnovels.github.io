Eighteen years passed in a blur.

Over these past decades, after earning my first significant capital, I started running my own Twitter account.

I never appeared on camera myself; instead, my sweet, innocent child was the star.

She was a natural in front of the camera, every movement graceful and captivating, instantly capturing the audience's attention.

Within a year of starting the account, her follower count reached over a million.

She had been a child model since she was little, and even at a young age, she had endorsed several major national clothing brands, her sweet smile leaving a lasting impression.

As she grew older, she ventured into the modeling industry. Whether it was photoshoots for print ads or walking runways for major designers, she excelled at everything, a true darling of the camera.

Her fame now was far greater than in my previous life.

To celebrate her successful completion of a major brand fashion show, I specifically hosted a small celebration banquet for her at a five-star hotel.

My colleagues and friends were there, along with many of her industry connections. The room was filled with dazzling personalities.

But just as Autumn raised her glass to toast with everyone, Derek appeared.

He wasn't alone; his arm was linked with my ex-girlfriend, Sarah, both dressed to make a statement.

Derek, his face filled with a tender smile, reached out and took Autumn’s hand. “Daughter, Daddy finally sees you.”

Everyone froze, trying to figure out what kind of stunt this was.

Autumn immediately pulled her hand away, stepping back warily.

“My dad passed away a long time ago. Why are you pretending to be him?”

Derek’s face was filled with emotion. “Silly child, I am your father. Back then, I was severely injured and died on the way to the hospital. Before I passed, I entrusted you to Alex.”

“But unexpectedly, I woke up on the way to the crematorium and my life was saved.”

“Later, I came back to look for you, but you were already gone.”

“I’ve been searching for you for eighteen years. I’ve always loved you! I’m your real dad!”

Derek even shed tears as he spoke, looking overjoyed to be reunited.

I watched him perform with a faint smile.

He clearly thought everything was playing out just like in my last life, believing this successful new model whom *I* had raised, was his biological daughter.

But I had been reborn. How could I fall for his trick again?

“Derek, you want to claim paternity, do you?”

“Of course! I think about my child every single day!”

I smiled, looking at him. “But you’ve got the wrong person. She’s not your daughter.”


Derek exploded.

“What do you mean she’s not my daughter?!”

“Don’t think that just because you raised her for eighteen years, she now has your blood running through her veins!”
