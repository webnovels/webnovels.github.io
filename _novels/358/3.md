Hearing my refusal, Derek stopped playing the dying man, sat up abruptly, and pointed at me, yelling full of vigor.

“Alex, are you even human?! You call me your brother, but in reality, you’re ungrateful, cold-blooded, and heartless!”

“You wouldn’t donate blood to save me, fine. But you won’t even raise my only daughter? What kind of a brother are you, you piece of garbage!”

I watched him coolly. “Oh, Derek, you seem pretty energetic now, don’t you? You don’t look like you’re about to die at all. Did this quack doctor misdiagnose you?”

As I spoke, I glanced at Dr. Evans, who stood by, and she instinctively averted her gaze.

Realizing his performance was off, Derek suddenly clutched his chest and collapsed, gasping for air and trembling all over.

I had to admit, his acting was good. Dr. Evans immediately reacted, pushing me out, saying she needed to perform emergency aid on Mr. Miller.

I wanted to see what other tricks Derek had up his sleeve, so I stood outside the emergency room and waited.

About ten minutes later, Dr. Evans came out holding a cooing baby.

“I’m so sorry, Mr. Miller is gone. That was just a final surge of life.”

“This child is his daughter. His dying wish was for you to care for her until she grows up.”

“As for the adoption procedures, don’t worry, Mr. Miller made all the arrangements before he passed. The paperwork will be completed within two days.”

“You just need to raise the child well. If you abandon her, that’s illegal, and if I find out, I will absolutely make sure you go to jail!”

After saying this, she tried to thrust the baby into my arms. I immediately stepped back.

Are you kidding me? Forcing a child on someone like this is actually illegal!

In my last life, blinded by so-called brotherhood, I never questioned the truth of this series of events.

Thinking about it now, it's ridiculous. Even with proper adoption procedures, it couldn't happen this fast.

“You said Derek died, right? Fine, then I want to see his body.”

Saying this, I bypassed her and rushed into the emergency room.

It was completely empty inside.

Dr. Evans’s urgent voice rang out. “What are you doing! You can’t just go in there!”

I pointed at the empty emergency room. “Didn’t you say he died? Where’s the body? Where did you send it?”

Dr. Evans said matter-of-factly, “The body was, of course, sent to the crematorium immediately for cremation.”

I asked again, “Sent to the crematorium that quickly? Alright, I’ll go to the crematorium now to see him off.”

Saying this, I ignored her protests and strode out of the hospital.

Want me to be a fool and raise his kid? In your dreams!

Upon arriving at the city crematorium, I immediately inquired with the staff about Derek’s remains.

To my surprise, they actually had registered information. Soon, a staff member brought me Derek’s urn.

In my previous life, I was too distraught. I just took his daughter home and only attended Derek’s funeral a week later after receiving notification.

“Is this Derek’s ashes?”

“Yes.”

The staff member gave a brief reply and quickly left.

But I still felt something was off.

Normal cremation of a body doesn't happen that fast. Even at the quickest, it takes at least a day.

And now, less than three hours had passed between Dr. Evans announcing Derek’s death and me receiving his urn.

It was practically a mockery of my intelligence.

So the next moment, I opened the urn and unhesitatingly poured its contents onto the floor.
