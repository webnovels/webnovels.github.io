“Cough, cough… Alex, you’re finally here…”

Derek lay on the ground, filthy and covered in an ugly mosaic of purplish-blue bruises. Deep gashes bled on his arms and legs.

I froze, then suddenly realized I had actually been reborn!

“Alex, what are you standing there for… cough, cough, take me to the hospital…”

Derek lay weakly on the ground, speaking to me without an ounce of strength.

In my last life, I received his desperate call and rushed to find him.

The sight of him covered in blood sent me into a panic, and I immediately thought of calling 911 for an ambulance.

But Derek insisted the location was too remote, and he'd be dead by the time 911 arrived.

So, I personally carried him on my back, stumbling for over two hours, back to the city, and straight to the hospital.

But now, the thought of it all being his elaborate scheme made a wave of profound disgust wash over me.

“No need to call 911, it’s too remote here… just carry me…”

Derek coughed a few times, looking at me pleadingly.

I frowned, feigning discomfort, and bent down to rub my ankle.

“I’m sorry, I wish I could carry you, but I just twisted my ankle. I really can’t carry you.”

Afraid he wouldn't believe me, I even pulled up my pant leg to show him my visibly swollen and red ankle.

In my last life, I had endured the pain to carry him, and by the time we reached the hospital, my ankle was practically useless. It cost a fortune to heal.

This time, I wouldn't be so foolish.

Derek’s face instantly paled, looking as if he was truly on his last breath.

Just then, an SUV pulled up beside us. The driver, a kind stranger, warmly asked if we needed help.

To avoid raising suspicion, I quickly smiled and accepted.

At the hospital, Derek was immediately rushed into the emergency room.

Soon, a female doctor, Dr. Evans, hurried out, saying Derek had lost too much blood and needed a transfusion.

“The hospital’s blood bank is severely low. A transfer would take too long and could delay treatment.”

“Mr. Miller said you have the same blood type as him. Please come with me to prepare for a blood transfusion.”

I scoffed internally at her words.

This was the exact same spiel as in my last life. This doctor had used the same excuse, drawing 600cc of my blood without a single word of explanation.

Normally, blood donations don't exceed 400cc, but I was too distraught to notice then. After the blood draw, I felt weak all over and dizzy.

And Derek had used that moment to plead with me to take care of his daughter in the hospital room, and I, in my dazed state, had nodded and agreed.

So I told Dr. Evans, “I apologize, but I have low blood sugar and anemia. I can’t donate blood. You’ll have to find another solution.”

Dr. Evans didn’t expect my refusal. She stomped her foot angrily and hurried back into the emergency room.

Another twenty minutes passed. Dr. Evans emerged, her face filled with sorrow.

“I’m sorry, we did our best, but Mr. Miller’s condition is too severe. There’s nothing more we can do.”

“He’s still conscious now. You can go in and spend his final moments with him.”

I nodded, my face calm, and walked in.

Sure enough, Derek was lying on the hospital bed, pale and weak, just like in my previous life. He faintly called my name.

I walked to his side. “What is it? Do you have anything you want to tell me?”

Tears welled up in Derek’s eyes. “Alex, you’re my best friend. Why didn’t you donate blood for me? If you had, maybe I…”

Dr. Evans, standing nearby, interjected indignantly. “Yes, Mr. Miller truly considered you his best friend, yet you refused. It’s a tragedy Mr. Miller is so young and can’t hold on. You’re truly heartless.”

I said calmly, “You should blame your hospital for not even having the blood a patient needs. I have low blood sugar and anemia. If something happened to me because of a blood donation, would your hospital pay with its life?”
