My grandfather is the wealthiest man in Country A, and as his only granddaughter, I'm on the brink of inheriting a massive conglomerate.

However, my two uncles are letting their mistress take over my identity.

In front of the national media, Nora Johnson snatched the share transfer document and looked at me with arrogance.

"Someone like you, from the lower rungs of society, wouldn't even dream of stepping into the conglomerate if it weren't for me!"

"I suggest you behave, or you might find yourself with no place to rest!"

In my previous life, I was deceived and intimidated by my uncles, constantly backing down to Nora, allowing her to trample over me to rise higher. But this time, I've been given another chance.
