When my mother asked me to choose between inheriting the family's $3 billion trust fund or receiving a monthly allowance of $1,500, I didn't hesitate to choose the $1,500 allowance.

I wasn't panicking, but my rich roommate, Vanessa, was going crazy.

In my previous life, after I chose to inherit the $3 billion, Vanessa stole my family's trust fund and invited the entire class to Las Vegas.

Overnight, the $3 billion was squandered, the family business went bankrupt, and my mother passed away from a heart attack in a fit of rage.

When I confronted Vanessa about repaying the money, she hid behind my boyfriend, looking innocent and wronged.

"Aria, you can't blame me just because your family went bankrupt," she said with a pitiful expression.

My boyfriend, Lucas, even kicked me, breaking my ribs, and accused me, "Aria Johnson, it was clearly you who spent recklessly and got addicted to gambling. How dare you accuse Vanessa! Have you no shame?"

When I was about to hire a private investigator, I was run over by a car and killed.

My boyfriend and the entire class testified for Vanessa, insisting that I had intentionally thrown myself in front of the car because I couldn't cope with the bankruptcy.

When I opened my eyes again, I was back on the day I chose to inherit the family fortune.

On the eve of graduation, someone in the class suggested going to Las Vegas to celebrate.

"Everyone, let's go to Las Vegas for a trip before graduation. I'll cover all the expenses!" Vanessa's words sent a shiver down my spine, the pain of broken bones still lingering.

Suddenly, I realized I had been reborn!

As soon as Vanessa finished speaking, the whole class cheered.

"Vanessa, you're awesome! As expected of a rich girl!"

"Since we're going to Vegas, we have to hit the casinos! I've only seen them in ads, never been there myself!"

Vanessa smiled brightly, "Sure, let's go to the casino then!" She then turned her gaze towards me and walked to my side.

"Aria, I heard your family has VIP status at the casino. Can I borrow your VIP card? Let everyone enjoy the top-tier service."

My face turned cold. In my previous life, the tragedy of my family's downfall all started with Vanessa borrowing my card.

Back then, under the pretext of borrowing the card, she secretly took away the $3 billion trust fund bank card my mother had left for me at the Swiss Bank.

When the court called my phone to inform me that the company had gone bankrupt, I realized that the money Vanessa had used to treat the entire class was my family's trust fund.

When I went to Vanessa's house to ask her to repay the money, she hid behind my boyfriend, looking wronged.

"Aria, you can't blame me just because your family went bankrupt," she said.

My boyfriend, Lucas, even kicked me, breaking my ribs, and accused me, "Aria Johnson, it was clearly you who spent recklessly and got addicted to gambling. How dare you accuse Vanessa! Have you no shame?"

When I was about to hire a private investigator, Vanessa directly ran me over with her car, repeatedly crushing me until I was dead.

Afterwards, Lucas and the entire class testified for Vanessa, saying that I had become suicidal after the bankruptcy and intentionally threw myself in front of the car.

My mother also passed away due to a heart attack triggered by extreme emotions.

I mechanically reached into my bag, my fingertips touching the cold metal card, gripping it tightly.

Seeing no reaction from me, Vanessa affectionately linked her arm with mine.

"Aria, don't be so stingy! Just let everyone use it, you won't lose anything!"

"Sorry, that card belongs to my mother. I can't lend it out casually," I said, stuffing the VIP card back into the deepest part of my bag.

Hearing my words, Vanessa's face showed displeasure.

"You're going to inherit your mother's company anyway, why be so particular about it?"

Lucas suddenly snatched my bag and emptied all my belongings onto the ground. My phone, tablet, and the camera I had just bought scattered all over the floor.

Lucas immediately spotted the golden card and picked it up, handing it to Vanessa.

"Here it is. Just take it and use it!"

As Vanessa took it, she meaningfully caressed Lucas's hand.

"Lucas is so sensible. Aria, you should learn from your boyfriend."

Suddenly, her eyes lit up, fixating on the camera on the ground.

"Oh, isn't this the Hasselblad camera I love? I heard it's sold out everywhere. I've been trying to get one but couldn't!"

Lucas, noticing Vanessa's longing gaze, immediately bent down to pick up the camera and stuffed it into Vanessa's arms.

"You can have it too. Aria's already bored with it anyway."

"Thank you, Lucas," Vanessa's face immediately bloomed with a smile.

I frowned deeply and snatched back my camera and VIP card. "Sorry, I'm not lending either of these!"

Lucas immediately showed an annoyed expression and grabbed me, scolding harshly, "Aria Johnson, when did you become so stingy?!"

"Me, stingy?" I angrily slapped him across the face.

Slap!

The crisp sound of the slap echoed in the classroom. Lucas staggered back two steps, holding his face.

His wide eyes were full of disbelief. "Aria Johnson! You dare to hit me!"

I shook my tingling hand and sneered, "This slap is to teach you about boundaries. What gives you the right to give away my things to others?!"

The classroom immediately erupted into chaos.

"Aria Johnson, are you crazy?"

"It's just a camera, what's the big deal?"

"You even hit your own boyfriend!"

"Think you're all that because you're rich?"

Vanessa hurriedly supported Lucas, then turned to glare at me angrily. "Aria, Lucas was just trying to do something nice for everyone. What's with your attitude!"

I bent down to pick up my scattered belongings, calmly putting the VIP card back into my pocket. "My attitude is very clear. I'm not lending it!"

Lucas suddenly broke free from Vanessa's hand and rushed over. "Aria Johnson! Give the card back to Vanessa right now and apologize to us, or we're breaking up! I don't want my girlfriend to be someone so ill-mannered!"

"Give it back? It's my thing to begin with, who am I giving it back to?" I dodged his outstretched hand, a smile curling at my lips. "If you want to break up, fine. It'll save me the breakup fee!"

This statement was like poking a hornet's nest. Lucas trembled with anger. "You... you think I care about your money?"

"Don't care?" I raised an eyebrow, looking at the Cartier watch on his wrist.

"Then give back the birthday gift I gave you last week?"

His face instantly turned pale, unconsciously covering his watch.

The expressions of the surrounding classmates immediately became strange.

Emma Thompson, the class president, suddenly stood up angrily and slammed the table. "Aria Johnson, you're too selfish! Vanessa is kindly inviting everyone to Las Vegas, can't you consider the group for once?"

"That's right," the study representative also chimed in, "You always act so agreeable, but when it really matters, you show your true colors."

I looked around at these familiar yet strange faces. In my previous life, it was they who unanimously testified in court that I had committed suicide by throwing myself in front of a car.

"Vanessa is inviting you to Las Vegas, so go ask her. Why are you asking me?"

Vanessa stepped forward again. "If we use your VIP card, won't it raise your VIP status at the casino? It's a win-win situation!"

Lucas stood intimately beside Vanessa, the pain on his face seemingly vanished.

"Vanessa, you're so considerate. Aria is being so difficult, yet you're still thinking of her."

"Since you all want to go to Las Vegas so badly..." I slowly pulled out a card from my wallet, "I'll lend it to you then?"

Vanessa's eyes lit up, her hand reaching out to take it.

I flipped my wrist, revealing the full card—it was my student meal card.

"Are you mocking me?!" Vanessa's face turned ashen.

"Pot calling the kettle black," I spun the meal card on my fingertip. "Aren't you all trying to emotionally blackmail me?"

Lucas suddenly grabbed the chalk box from the podium and threw it at me. "Aria Johnson! I must have been blind to be with you!"

I dodged to the side, and the chalk scattered on the ground.

Seeing that I wouldn't hand over the VIP card, Vanessa's face instantly darkened.

She gave a look to the surrounding classmates, and several girls immediately surrounded me.

"Aria Johnson, don't be so stubborn," Vanessa lowered her voice, her eyes sinister. "It's just a card. Do you have to make such a scene?"

I let out a cold laugh, holding my bag in front of me. "What, planning to rob me if I won't lend it?"

"Rob? We're just trying to make you 'come to your senses'!" Emma suddenly pushed me from behind. I stumbled a few steps and crashed into a desk. My bag fell to the ground with a thud, its contents once again scattered all over the floor.

Lucas stood by, a mocking smile on his lips. "Serves you right."

A few girls took the opportunity to kick away my textbooks. One of them deliberately stepped on my camera, and the device cracked with a snap.

"What are you doing?!" I suddenly stood up, but my shoulder was forcefully pressed down.

"Aria, don't be so stingy," Vanessa said with a fake smile, her hand reaching for my pocket. "We're all classmates, what's wrong with borrowing a card?"

I slapped her hand away. "Get lost!"

This action thoroughly angered Vanessa. Her face darkened, and she suddenly grabbed my chin with her nails. "You want to do this the hard way, huh?"

The surrounding classmates, instead of stopping her, started to cheer:

"Teach her a lesson! Think she's all that because she's rich?"

"Stop pretending, it's just a stupid card!"

Seeing that I wouldn't back down, Vanessa directly swung a slap towards my face.

I dodged to the side, grabbed her wrist, and twisted it hard.

"Ah!" She cried out in pain and staggered backward.

Seeing this, Lucas shouted angrily, "Aria Johnson! How dare you fight back?!"

He rushed forward to grab my hair, but I pushed him away and quickly took out my phone from my pocket, dialing 91
