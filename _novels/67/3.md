Just after getting bandaged and moved to a VIP ward, my mom's call came.

Answering, I briefly explained what happened. Thinking of Adeline's selfless protection warmed me inside.

My mom couldn't sit still after hearing.

"What?! That Asher wanted to cripple your hands? Does he not know the Harper Family's power?"

"And that vile Phoebe, I'll make them regret ever living."

I nodded in agreement. "Mom, I want you to cancel Phoebe's inheritance rights and kick her out of the Harper Family."

"And Adeline, if not for her, I wouldn't have escaped. I'll introduce her to you later."

My mom firmly promised.

Thinking of Adeline, who risked everything to protect me, filled me with warmth.

Mom was instantly on edge after hearing what I had to say.

"What did you just say?! That Asher wants to damage your hand? Clearly, he’s unaware of how the Harper Family operates!"

"And Phoebe, that ungrateful brat, I will make sure she regrets ever being born."

I nodded in agreement, "Mom, I want you to strip Phoebe of all inheritance rights and kick her out of the Harper Family."

"And Adeline, if it weren't for her help, I wouldn’t have made it out. I’ll introduce her to you when the time is right."

Mom gave me her firm promise.

"Don’t worry, from the moment he dared to harm you, he ceased to be a member of the Harper Family."

"I've already instructed my secretary to come and pick me up. Wait for me, I’m coming back to support you!"

Once I hung up, I felt a wave of relief and wanted to visit Adeline in the next hospital room.

Just as I got out of bed, the door swung open.

I looked up to see Phoebe entering with a group of bodyguards. Without saying a word, she kicked me hard in the stomach.

"Who do you think you are to mess with Asher?"

The blow knocked me to the ground, leaving me in too much pain to speak.

I couldn't understand what right Phoebe had to attack me.

She was merely an adopted daughter my parents had taken in. Without them, she might still be scavenging for food on the streets.

Before I went abroad at five, I treated her like my own sister.

Even after returning, I suggested to Mom that she should inherit the family business alongside me.

It was my family that gave her a new life, yet she was the one dragging me down to hell.

Asher, who should have been detained and awaiting my decision, stepped out from behind Phoebe.

He looked at me in my miserable state and mocked me.

"Let it go, sister Phoebe. Declan said he's the Tycoon's only son, and we can't afford to offend him..."

Phoebe sneered, her gaze filled with contempt.

"There is indeed a young master in the Harper Family, but it’s not you—a loser who schemed his way into becoming the godson."

"I grew up in the Harper Family. How could I not recognize who the true heir is?"

Phoebe's words left me bewildered, but I am indeed the Tycoon's son.

At that moment, a middle-aged man stepped out from behind Phoebe.

I recognized him as Liam Parker, my mom's assistant, and felt a glimmer of hope once again.

I'm sorry, but I need the text that you want me to translate in order to proceed.
