When I filed for divorce, Damon Maxwell was playing with a scrap of lace his latest fling had sent him, a cheap, brazen gesture of affection.

He typed out the hotel room number, sent it, and then glanced at the paperwork.

“Making a big production out of it this time, aren't we, Your Majesty?”

I spoke calmly:

“I haven’t touched the accounts you set up. I’m waiving claim to the house and the cars. I’ve already sent the paperwork to your lawyer.”

He froze for a beat or two, still operating under the assumption that this was another tantrum.

“Waiving everything?”

“Then what do you want, Serena? My fidelity?”

“Sweetheart, I’ve always been clear. You’re the main event, the love of my life. But exclusivity? That’s just… boring.”

He held out a tissue, assuming I would dissolve into tears, the way I always had.

My heart would break, and the waterworks would begin.

But I just shook my head.

I had stopped wanting Damon’s fidelity a long time ago.

Now, I just wanted a clean slate.

Damon raised an eyebrow, the look of surprise quickly fading.

“Right. Seven years, I guess you’re past the age of getting hysterical over a few passing interests.”

“Let me guess. This is about me missing your prenatal appointment yesterday, isn’t it?”

He chuckled softly, reaching to stroke my small bump.

“Wife, you’re blaming the wrong man. You won’t believe the firecracker I’ve been dealing with this week. Hot temper, totally fearless. I had flown down to Miami to pick up your custom jewelry, and she started demanding it. Took me the better part of the day to get her back in line.”

My lips went white for a fleeting second. Get her back in line?

How exactly had he "gotten her back in line"?

He’d spent the day passionately rolling around with someone else, yet he was still using me as the cover story.

No wonder that jewelry box had contained a damp pair of underwear mixed in with the tissue paper.

“It was just a prenatal check-up. You had four nannies and security. What am I supposed to do, join the waiting room with a bouquet? I’m not a prop.”

Seeing my expression remain unchanged, he started to speak again, but a flurry of notification sounds interrupted him.

He opened the video message.

A breathy, coquettish voice drifted from the phone.

“Damon, you’re so slow.”

“If you don't hurry up, I’ll get tired of waiting, and then you’ll have to beg me to come back.”

Damon subtly glanced at my face, gauging my reaction.

This had happened too many times to count. I was far calmer than I had any right to be.

I took a deep breath and lifted my hand, stopping him.

A relieved smile spread across Damon’s face.

“See? My baby still cares.”

“Be good. I’ll be back soon. I promise to cook dinner for you and the little one myself tonight.”

“Don’t bother. Just sign the divorce papers first.”

“After that, we go our separate ways. No one will be around to police your promiscuity anymore.”

Damon’s arm froze mid-air.

After a long moment, he cupped my face.

He finally saw the cold detachment in my eyes.

When he spoke again, his voice was unintentionally husky:

“Serena, there's a limit to how far you can take a joke.”

When I remained silent, he finally began to flip through the divorce agreement.

“No house, no car?”

“You’re even waiving the money from the funds I set up for you.”

He let out a dry, nervous laugh.

“You plan to get divorced and go live in some rundown studio apartment, completely broke?”

“Serena, you might be willing to suffer, but is the baby willing to suffer with you?”

“I’ve obviously protected you too well. You’re still so adorably naive.”

I didn’t reply.

I wasn’t taking the house or the cars because I had no intention of staying here.

The baby?

He didn’t know. That little life had already stopped beating on a cold surgical table.

“Given the chronic stress and trauma, the loss was a natural selection,” the doctor had said. At that very moment, Damon had been on fire in bed with a mistress.

Damon continued, unaware:

“Serena, put everything else aside, are you really going to abandon Grandma?”

“She has cancer. How many years does she have left? Do you want her to spend her last days worrying about your messy divorce?”

It turned out he didn't know that either. Grandma had already passed.

His phone buzzed relentlessly. His mistress was impatient.

He scoffed, signing his name with an irritable flourish.

“Serena, I don’t believe you’ll actually divorce me.”

“I’ll humor you. Consider this part of a weird role-play.”

“But tomorrow, you’ll have to visit Grandma alone.”

The door slammed shut.

I smoothed the papers he’d ruffled and called Mrs. Maxwell.

“He signed the divorce agreement.”

“Please expedite my transfer application to the Berlin branch.”
