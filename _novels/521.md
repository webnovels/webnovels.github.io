My husband was passionately entangled with his newly kept mistress next door.

On the other side of the wall, I was putting our daughter to sleep.

"Mommy, is Daddy hurting another lady again?" she asked innocently, her little face full of sadness. Young as she was, she didn't understand what her father was doing.

I swallowed my pain and comforted her to sleep.

As dawn approached, a pair of strong arms wrapped tightly around my waist, and a sensual voice panted in my ear.

"Sorry I'm late tonight. Hope I didn't keep you waiting."

He kissed my earlobe gently, as if we were lovers.

Everyone knew that no matter how Lucas Shaw was entangled with other women, he would always hold his beloved wife to fall asleep.

I lay awake all night, watching the frantic stream of messages on my phone.

"Sis, it's so cold today. Even my six-pack abs are getting chilly."
