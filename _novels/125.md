During a meeting, my online boyfriend sent me a shirtless photo. In my excitement, I accidentally sent a message meant for him to my boss instead.

"Honey, I'm really broke this month. My paycheck hasn't come through yet."

My boss's face darkened as he growled, "Get out. I'm not your 'honey'."

My coworkers thought the boss hated me and started mocking me behind my back.

Little did they know that after I had an abrupt breakup with my online boyfriend, my boss pulled me onto his desk, his whole body trembling.

"Baby, I'm not your boss. I'm your husband."

"Please don't hate me, baby. I love you so much. Don't break up with me, I'm begging you."
