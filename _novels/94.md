Every time my wife had an intimate conversation with her assistant, I would write a number in her diary.

When she asked me what it meant, I joked playfully:

"Every time you hurt me, I keep a record. When it reaches 100, I'll leave you."

By the time I wrote 99, she didn't take it seriously.

When I wrote 100, I heard rhythmic moans coming from the CEO's office.

"Marcus, give me a child. Be my man, okay?"

My hand, ready to knock on the door, fell limp at her words.

Back home, I took down all our wedding photos, my anger and resentment having nowhere to go.

I picked up a pen and wrote eight words furiously in the diary: "Lily, it's over between us!"

Suddenly, a sentence appeared below: "Who are you? Why are you writing in my diary?"

"And what does this 100 mean?"

Overcome with emotion, I forgot to be afraid and replied: I'm Adrian, because you don't love him.

"This 100 represents my 100 disappointments in you. I'm leaving you."
