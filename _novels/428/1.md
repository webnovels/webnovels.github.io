My daughter Lily also looked at me smugly.

"You left the Jiang family so decisively back then. I thought you had some skills up your sleeve. Turns out you've just been wandering around homeless this whole time!"

"If I were you, I'd find a block of tofu and smash my head into it. Save everyone the oxygen you're wasting."

I paused for a moment, looking at Lily with a complicated expression.

I couldn't believe that after all these years, she was still so disrespectful, with no regard for her elders.

But I wasn't angry. I just looked at them calmly.

"What does this have to do with you?"

From the moment they kicked me out of the Jiang family, I no longer had any connection to them.

"Your Jiang family may be doing a bit better now. You might even be comparable to one of Ethan's subsidiaries."

"But that's your own business. No need to brag about it to me."

Seeing that I wasn't showing the reaction they wanted, the father-daughter pair were taken aback for a moment.

After a while, Jack looked at me with disdain.

"You've been reduced to wandering homeless, yet you're still so stubborn?"

"If it weren't for Dad wanting to see you for his 80th birthday, we wouldn't even bother looking at you."

"But since Dad asked, whether you agree or not, you have to come back with us."

Jack's tone was full of determination, just like in the past.

I still shook my head.

"Those are your parents!"

"From the moment I left, I no longer had any parents."

Although they raised me, I had already repaid that debt when I left empty-handed, leaving all the assets to them.

Seeing that I was still so stubborn, Lily's face became even more contemptuous.

"You've been reduced to wandering homeless. No need to put on an act in front of us."

"Us bringing you back is a favor to you, understand?"

"But even if you come back, don't you dare have any ideas about Aunt Olivia. We'll never let that happen."

Looking at her increasingly fierce expression, my heart sank a little.

She had always been extremely cunning, even as a child.

When she was just 7 or 8 years old, in order to stay with her aunt forever, she deliberately ran into the middle of the road to lure me over.

When a speeding car approached, she suddenly dodged to the side. But I, focused only on saving her, was hit and thrown several meters.

While I was seriously injured in the hospital, she slandered me, saying I was trying to take her with me to commit suicide, all to help her aunt enter the Jiang family smoothly.

Later, when I told Jack about this, he just sneered.

"She's only 8 years old. How could she have such vicious thoughts?"

"I think you're the truly vicious one, framing your own daughter for your own benefit."

What he said wasn't wrong.

If I hadn't experienced it myself, I wouldn't have believed an 8-year-old could have such malicious intentions.

But that was the reality, no matter how unbelievable.

The flesh and blood I once cherished more than my own life had become the one who hurt me the deepest.

Looking at Lily before me now, in my heart I already saw her as a complete stranger.

Just as I was lost in thought, Jack and Lily kicked aside the dog Yellow that had accompanied me for years, and roughly dragged me into their car.

I struggled desperately, wanting to check on Yellow's condition, but was no match for the two of them.

Lily even took out a fruit knife from the car and waved it in front of my face.

"You ugly freak, you'd better behave. Otherwise I'll disfigure the other side of your face too!"
