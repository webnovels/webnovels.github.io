"Grandpa and Grandma are calling you inside."

After I don't know how long standing in the cold wind, Lily finally came out and told me in an unfriendly tone.

I nodded and followed behind Lily into the house, my face pale.

"Rose, after all these years, can you still not let go of what happened back then?"

As soon as we entered the living room, my father sitting on the sofa questioned me sternly.

I shook my head, looking at him with incomprehension.

"Do you think this is something easy to let go of?"

Back then, Olivia not only took over my family, but also guided the young Lily to push me into the abyss.

Yet they not only didn't see it as Olivia's fault, but turned all the blame on me. How could I possibly let go so easily?

My mother snorted coldly as she looked at me.

"Even if Olivia hadn't married Jack, do you think you'd still be worthy of him?"

"A woman like you with no education and a ruined face - Jack would probably be laughed at just taking you out for a walk. How did I give birth to such an ungrateful daughter?"

Hearing my mother's words, I once again felt as if my whole being was being torn apart.

During my school years, my grades were not bad. They were even better than Olivia's.

Unfortunately, our Lin family wasn't well-off at the time. Supporting one college student was already a struggle, let alone two.

After their constant persuasion, I had no choice but to give up my studies and start working to support Olivia through school.

Later, with our family's all-out support, Olivia not only went to college, but also got into graduate school.

Olivia naturally became their pride and joy, while I, the sister who gave up everything for her, not only didn't receive their gratitude, but was belittled to the bone.

In their words, it all seemed to have become my fault.

I could no longer control the emotions in my heart and shouted at them.

"Put your hand on your heart and ask yourself, is this really my fault?"

The room fell into a brief silence.

My father sighed and finally spoke again.

"Olivia is your younger sister. As the older sister, shouldn't you have yielded to her a bit?"

"It's all in the past now. There's no use dwelling on these things anymore. I just hope you can let go of all grudges and stay by our side to take care of us. Jack's business is growing bigger and bigger now. We can't let the two of them be distracted."

Hearing his words, I laughed coldly in my heart. Now I finally knew their purpose in calling me back - the family needed a maid, so they wanted to call back their obedient daughter to be the maid.

If it weren't for this, they probably wouldn't have even remembered my existence as their daughter.

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and tried hard not to feel too hurt.

"I can only stay here for one day. I can't stay by your side forever."

Even if they had spoken a little more tactfully, or shown a bit more warmth towards me, as their daughter, I would have stayed by their side without hesitation.

But their words and actions were too hurtful, completely extinguishing the last bit of hope I had for them in my heart.

"You think you still have a choice in this matter? Rose Lin, let me make this clear to you today - no matter what, you must stay by Mom and Dad's side to take care of them."

Jack's tone was full of arrogance, leaving no room for argument.

I looked at him in disbelief. "Do I not even have the right to choose my own life anymore?"

Jack snorted coldly.

"Isn't staying in our Jiang family better than begging everywhere? We're all doing this for your own good."

Before I could react, Jack waved his hand. Several of the Jiang family's servants rushed over, roughly tied me up, gagged me, and locked me in a guest room nearby.

The guests watching this scene had long become used to it. They all knew that Jack had abandoned a previous wife before. And I knew without thinking that I was that previous wife Jack had abandoned.

My facial features were just too distinctive.

"Rose Lin, I think you have far too many issues now. Today I'll have someone help correct this nasty habit of yours first."

Jack said these final words to me before directly locking the door. Inside the room, several servants holding clubs were eyeing me menacingly.

Before I could react, those servants had already started beating me viciously with their clubs.

The intense pain made me curl up my body and struggle constantly.

Soon, my whole body was covered in blood.

However, those servants seemed to have received instructions from Jack and showed no signs of stopping.

Gradually my consciousness became fuzzy, and I felt like I could barely breathe.

Only then did Jack walk in again, looking at me with a ferocious expression.

"If you don't agree to stay, I'll beat you like this every day until you agree!"

Hearing Jack's words, my heart was filled with despair. Was I really going to be trapped here like an animal for the rest of my life?

Tears mixed with blood kept falling down my cheeks. I felt like I had fallen into a bottomless abyss once again.
