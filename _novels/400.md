I was linked to a Sickness Transmigration System.
It dumped me into the body of the true heiress, despised by everyone.
Everyone adored the fake heiress, who’d been carefully cherished by the family for sixteen years.
My three brothers feared I’d try to claim what belonged to the fake heiress, so they constantly mocked and taunted me.
My biological parents were terrified my presence would upset the fake heiress, so they went all out to make it up to her.
They never once considered my feelings.
They saw my desperate yearning for love as a threat, as sheer jealousy.
Later, I was dying.
Even later, my second brother found the diary hidden under my pillow.
They fell apart.

0I was linked to a Sickness Transmigration System.
It dropped me into the body of Elara Richard, the true heiress, half a year after she’d been found by the wealthy Richard family.
On my very first day here.
Someone splashed a whole plate of food right onto me.
Hot curry sauce ran down my face and neck, and fish balls rolled off my clothes onto the floor.
The heat stung.
I stared at the boy in front of me, my face blank.
My gaze was blank, devoid of any emotion.
Everyone else was startled by his actions too.
Eleanor, my mother, gasped, "Liam, what are you doing!"
Liam's face flickered with a hint of regret, but the words that burst out were nothing but blame.
"It's just that she always has that deadpan face! Jessica talked to her, didn't she hear?"
Jessica looked guilty at his words.
"I'm so sorry, I didn't know it was because of me..."
She looked at me apologetically.
"My third brother didn't mean it. Elara, can I apologize to you for him?"
Liam instantly bristled.
"Who is she, anyway? Why would you even apologize to her? Jessica, why do you even bother with her?!"
I gave a faint, bitter smile.
I wondered, too, what the original Elara meant to them.
Jessica stood, surrounded by my three brothers, dressed in a pristine white dress, her hair perfectly styled.
Meanwhile, my clothes were stained yellow with curry, and the smell of food clung to me, even without looking down.
Jessica.
The family's precious darling.
This name shouldn't have been hers.
I ignored Jessica.
I picked up the last remaining fish ball that had landed on my lap, swallowing it along with the curry still clinging to my lips.
It wasn't the taste I remembered.
I got up and left.
"I'm full. I'll head back to my room now, thank you."
As I turned, I met Mrs. Davis's worried gaze. I managed a small smile for her.
Silence fell over the dining table.
Richard and Eleanor looked displeased.
Marcus, my eldest brother, said in a low, stern voice, "Liam, you genuinely crossed a line this time. Elara didn't do a thing."
