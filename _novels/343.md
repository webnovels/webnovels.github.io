The smartest thing I ever did at 22 was make the bold move of getting into Julian Davies's bed.

From then on, I became his most unremarkable yet longest-staying mistress.

In our fifth year together, he handed me a card, his expression indifferent. "Chloe, we're done. Don't be clingy."

I took the card, a smile playing on my lips. "Understood, Mr. Davies."

Two years later, I married someone else, and his hair had turned stark white.
