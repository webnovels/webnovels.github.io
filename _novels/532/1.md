After my rebirth, the first thing I did was check my online banking balance.

Sure enough, there was only $50 left.

I quickly gathered my thoughts. At this point, my money had already been transferred to Rachel's card through some unknown method.

I wanted to confront Rachel and end it all, but remembering how my parents' hair turned white overnight after my death in my previous life, I regretted my actions.

If I acted impulsively again like last time, I'd only repeat the same tragedy.

Just then, Sarah, our department manager, called me over.

"Olivia, this order is tough be a bit tricky, but the commission is $500! Don't say I'm not looking out for you!"

I swallowed hard, almost instinctively.

$500 would be enough for a month's rent, with plenty left over.

But I still declined.

"Sarah, thank you. But I don't want to take any orders for the next month."

Ignoring Sarah's shocked expression, I turned and left the office.

Because of the poor soundproofing, the colleagues outside had already heard everything.

Immediately, discussions broke out.

"Olivia is the top salesperson in the whole company, nicknamed 'Hardworking Olivia'. She's actually not taking orders today?"

"Not just today, didn't you hear her say she won't take any for the next month!"

Ignoring the chatter around me, I opened a food delivery app and ordered the largest iced Americano, then deducted the last $50 from my card.

You should know, in my previous life, I couldn't even afford a $4 sweetened coffee.

To put down roots in this expensive city, I had tied my life to my belt.

Every day, I'd work on client follow-ups until 2 or 3 AM, then get up before dawn to squeeze into the packed subway for two hours, just to clock in at the company on time.

One late arrival meant a $50 fine.

That was nearly a week's worth of food money for me.

I dreamed of buying a house near the company, even if it was just a 300 square foot studio.

Every month when I got paid, I'd only leave $300 for living expenses.

The rest, I'd put into my bank account.

But I never expected that the $50,000 down payment I had desperso hard would up in someone else's pocket!

Just then, the office door was suddenly pushed open.

"Girls! Lunch is on me!" Rachel's loud voice instantly filled the room.

She was beaming, carrying the latest Chanel bag, looking like she'd just won the lottery.

"Let's go to the New Moon Hotel! Order whatever you want!"

The office erupted,oded with excitement, colleagues crowding around her.

"Rachel, did you strike it rich?"

"Which sugar daddy did you hook up with?"

I didn't move, just holding my coffee, staring at her coldly.

Because I knew, she was spending my money.

Rachel, surrounded by everyone, waved her hand, pretending to be modest:

"Oh, it's nothing. I just bought a lottery ticket the other day and won a small prize."

Someone immediately asked, "How much did you win?"
