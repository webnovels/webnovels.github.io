Rachel glanced at me, a smug smile tugging at her lips.

"Not much," she said casually, few hundred thousand."

"Whoa—"

A collective gasp went around the room.

A few hundred thousand was an astronomical figure for us working folk barely making over $10,000 a month.

But I noticed that since Rachel entered, her gaze kept drifting towards me, intentionally or not.

As if observing a lab rat's reaction.

She was watching to see if I had discovered that my bank card had become useless.

I suppressed the hatred surging in my heart, holding back the accusations that almost spilled out.

I couldn't startle the snake in the grass just yet.

I stood up, forcing a smile that was just right, even with a hint of envy.

"Congrats, Rachel! You've me bask in your good fortune."

Rachel saw my normal demeanor and flashed a look of surprise, then secretly let out a sigh of relief.

She probably thought I hadn't noticed the anomaly in my savings yet.

As lunchtime approached, Lily, who sat next to me, suddenly leaned over.

"Olivia, didn't you say you'd go house hunting once you saved enough for a down payment? When are you going? I'll come with you."

At the mention of the house, I clenched my fists tightly, my nails almost digging into my flesh.

But I quickly relaxed, my face still calm and collected.

"No rush," I said.

"I lost my ID card a few days ago and it takes time to get a new one. Besides, with house prices falling so fast, I'll wait and see a bit longer."

As soon as I finished speaking, I felt a gaze fall on me again.

It was Rachel.

She was looking at me again, her eyes unable to hide a hint of glee.

Rachel was originally an intern who had only been with the company for two months. She was 5'3", weighed 400 pounds, had an average appearance, and was at the bottom in terms of performance.

In our sales department, which valued looks and results, she should have been at the bottom of the food chain.

But in my previous life, it was her who took my $50,000 and first went for full-body liposuction, then plastic surgery.

She transformed overnight into a beautiful rich girl that everyone loved.

It was also her who used my money to buy people's hearts, colluding with several male colleagues to have me sent to a mental hospital on the grounds that I was "mentally unstable".

Thinking of the torture in the mental hospital for those two years, I took another deep breath to calm myself.

At noon, Rachel took us to the New Moon Hotel for lunch, telling us to order whatever we wanted with a grand air didn't hold back. I opened the menu and pointed straight to the most expensive pages.

"King crab, the biggest one."

"Australian lobster sashimi."

"And this, foie gras."

"Let's have some bird's nest soup too."

With each dish I ordered, the expressions of my colleagues around me became more and more interesting.

Lily tugged at my sleeve and whispered, "Olivia, isn't this... too wasteful?"

I smiled at her without saying a word.

How could spending my own money be called wasteful?

Rachel's cheeks twitched, but in front of everyone, she could only force a smile.

"It's fine, Olivia is our top salesperson, she's worked hard and deserves to eat well, it's only right."

She smiled brightly.

"In the future, she'll need to eat well and work hard to create more results for our department!"

Before I could speak, a colleague next to me chimed in:

"Oh, Rachel, you weren't here this morning so you don't know. Olivia just told Sarah that she's stopping all her orders for the next month."

The air instantly fell silent.

I wiped the corners of my mouth leisurely with a napkin, raising my eyes to look at Rachel.

The smile on her face froze inch by inch.

"What did you say?" She stared at me, her voice sharp as she shouted:

"Olivia, why are you stopping orders?"

"What do you mean?"
