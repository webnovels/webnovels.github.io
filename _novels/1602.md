Liam cheated with an employee twelve years his junior.
After I found out, he chose to come back home.
Until I accidentally saw an unsigned text on his phone.
"I'm getting married tomorrow. Can you come to Manhattan to see me one last time?"
From our city to Manhattan, it was only a three-hour drive.
If he left now, he'd probably get there around one in the morning.
Watching him pack his bags, I said softly,
"Taking so many clothes? Planning to sleep with her again while you're there?"
"Do you need me to pack a box of condoms for you two?"
Liam looked up, his face etched with a weariness I'd never seen before.
"Scarlett, I've already chosen you. What more do you want?"
"Are you really going to push me until I break?"

I remember the sheer panic on his face when I caught him and Chloe checking into that hotel room.
Just like those wives on TV who catch their cheating husbands, in my extreme rage and heartbreak, I tore into them, hitting and scratching, snapping humiliating photos, and posting them online.
Chloe was utterly disgraced. She was fired from her job and moved out of town shortly after.
Liam, because of the scandal, lost a major contract worth hundreds of thousands, and was fired from his executive position.
Under immense public scrutiny and moral pressure, he formally apologized to me and returned home.
After coming back, he was completely devoted to me. Even when he was restarting his business, he took on the daily care of our newborn daughter, shouldering unprecedented stress, just so I could get some sleep.
In just one year, despite being busy and exhausted, his new company had taken off. As his status rose, he was absolutely thriving, both professionally and personally.
It was as if there were no real consequences for him at all.
Except for a few bad colds he caught early on from overwork.
And this was him saying I was pushing him until he broke?
How ironic.
I smirked. "Liam, how can you even say that?"
"Did you forget you swore you'd never go near her again?"
Liam folded his clothes one by one back into the closet, then closed his suitcase.
"Scarlett, it's been a while since we visited Mr. Davison and the kids at the orphanage. Let's go together tomorrow."
"Let's get some rest before Lily wakes up. You know how fussy she gets."
A hint of tenderness mixed with Liam's sickeningly calm expression.
I clenched my fists, my nails digging into my palms, but I barely felt it.
I hated his infuriating way of sidestepping the real issue.
He was the one who screwed up, so how could he act so completely unbothered?!
I scoffed, "What about Chloe then? You love her so much, aren't you afraid she'll be heartbroken if you don't go to Manhattan? Or are you afraid you'll be struck by lightning for breaking your vow?"
His face remained impassive.
"Scarlett, the kids love the puddings from that little dessert shop downtown. Remember to grab some tomorrow."
Liam was always like this.
The colder and more detached he acted, the deeper his feelings ran.
It used to be that way with me, and now it was the same with Chloe.
I just wanted to tear that fake mask right off his face.
I pulled open a drawer and took out a stack of letters.
Fighting the nausea in my stomach, I read them aloud, word by word.
"Chloe, you're like a cloud in the sky, untouched by the world. Seeing you, I finally understood such pure goodness exists."
"They say love can be fleeting, like a cloud, but I want to keep you forever in my heart, year after year, protecting your pristine purity."
"All I ask for in this life is to be by your side, never apart."
"Chloe, the one next to me isn't the one I truly want. Only in the deep of night, when I dream, can I see your eyes as pure as ever, so clean they make my heart tremble."
Finally, a crack appeared in Liam's composure. He roared, losing control, "Shut up! Scarlett, I just made a mistake! Haven't I paid enough for my mistakes this past year?"
"It's over! Why won't you ever forgive me?!"
I sneered, picking up the lacy thong that wasn't mine and throwing it in his face.
"Forgive you? Your love letters to her are just so… moving. I had to keep them. A constant reminder of the pure, beautiful Chloe you carry in your heart!"
