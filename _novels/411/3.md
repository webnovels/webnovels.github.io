My love for photography wasn't because I still had lingering feelings for Emma.

In fact, when I saw that suicide note in my previous life, I had already completely given up on her.

It's just that when I was reborn, I found that all the money had already been spent on photography equipment.

I couldn't sell it on second-hand platforms, so I had no choice but to pick it up and use it myself.

As a result, I really fell in love with photography.

In this life, it's not to please others, but just for myself.

I politely declined Emma's offer again, my tone courteous but distant.

"My hobby is enough to cover my living expenses. Thank you for your concern."

Seeing that I didn't appreciate her kindness, Emma's face flashed with anger.

"You're not taking the opportunity I'm giving you. Don't come crying to me for help later!"

I didn't say anything, nor did I tell her.

Now, my photography works are exclusively supplied to several national-level publications, as well as top international journals.

The various copyright fees, when added up, are not lower than Emma's income.

But if I said that, she would probably think I was bragging.

After all, in these wrinkled pajamas, I did look quite shabby.

It was all because of my son. He insisted on playing with me in the sandbox, and when I turned around, he had slipped downstairs again.

I didn't have time to change clothes before I chased after him.

Just as I was looking for an excuse to leave, the waiter from earlier seemed to have discovered something.

He pointed at my clothes and said, "Balenciaga? Where did you pick up this shirt? You're not a cleaner here who stole it from a guest's room, are you?"

I couldn't help but frown.

"Can't this shirt be my own?"

Lucas sneered, mocking, "Your own? Can you afford it? What rich person would dress so casually and run around like you?"

He dramatically covered his nose.

"It's so dirty, you probably put it on without even washing it after stealing it."

Emma looked at me, her brows furrowed so tightly they could kill a fly.

"Jack, have you really sunk so low? Do you still want to be stubborn?"

I didn't want to deal with them anymore and directly said to the waiter,

"If you really think I stole something, you can call the police right now."

I knew he saw Lucas's dissatisfaction with me and wanted to step on me to please him.

Sure enough, his aggressive attitude immediately deflated, and he muttered,

"If it weren't for the VIP guest at the hotel today, and we're afraid of disturbing them with people like you, I would have called the police already."

Lucas's eyes lit up, and he quickly chimed in.

"It must be the young lady from the Lawrence family, right? I heard she and her family are vacationing in Bay City and staying at this hotel."

Emma nodded, her eyes revealing a hint of anticipation.

"If only we could get the Lawrence family's support for the project our company is working on."

The words "young lady from the Lawrence family" were like throwing gasoline on a fire, immediately sparking a wave of discussion.

"Isn't the reason we came to this gala today to meet Miss Lawrence? This entire building belongs to her family."

"I heard she got married and had a child in her early twenties. I wonder which family's son she married into."

As everyone was discussing, the hotel manager came running in, sweating profusely, with a team of people behind him.

"Has anyone seen a seven-year-old boy, about this tall?"

The manager wiped his sweat, his eyes anxiously searching the hall.

Someone quick-witted, seeing such a commotion, immediately guessed what was happening.

"Is it the young master of the Lawrence family? I heard he's just seven years old this year."

The gala attendees became enthusiastic, hurriedly searching everywhere.

After all, if they found the child, there would be a chance to establish a connection with the Lawrence family.

Emma and Lucas also joined the search, no longer paying attention to me.

Looking at the chaotic hall, I walked straight to the dessert area.

Sure enough, I found my son under the table, his face smeared with cream.

I extended my hand with a stern face.

"Come here."

My son was startled and clung to the table leg, refusing to let go.

"No."

Just as I was about to pull him over, Lucas appeared out of nowhere, righteously blocking my way.

"Jack Thompson, what are you doing!"

"Even if you want to curry favor with the Lawrence family, you shouldn't lay hands on a child!"

Emma rushed over at the news, her eyes full of disappointment as she looked at me.

"Jack, I never thought you'd do something like this for fame and fortune."

The waiter grabbed the manager and tattled.

"It's this man, he suddenly barged into the gala and even stole clothes from other guests!"

The manager's face immediately darkened, and he called for security.

"Arrest this thief and send him straight to the police station! If he scares the young master, you'll all lose your jobs!"

A hint of a triumphant smile flashed in Lucas's eyes. He bent down and put on a kind face for the Lawrence family's young master.

"Come here to uncle, uncle will protect you."

My son ignored him completely. To everyone's astonishment, he cautiously reached out to hold my hand.

"Dad, I know I was wrong."
