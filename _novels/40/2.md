Back at the Winters mansion, Caleb once again threw me into the servants' room.

"Don't come out without my permission!" He slammed the door shut with a bang.

I slid to the floor. My neck, which had just been gripped, was still throbbing with pain. My heart felt numb.

I don't know how long it had been when my phone suddenly rang shrilly.

It was an unknown number.

"Is this Ms. Aria Sinclair? This is Central Hospital. Your brother Alex Sinclair has developed post-operative complications. His condition is critical. Please come immediately!"

My head felt like it was exploding.

I sprang up from the floor, frantically pounding on the door.

"Caleb Winters! Open the door! I need to go to the hospital!"

"My brother is in trouble! Please, open the door quickly!"

There was no response from outside, only faint music.

"Caleb Winters! Open the door!"

I pounded on the door with all my might. My hands turned red, and my throat went hoarse.

After a long while, the door was finally opened.

Caleb stood in the doorway, his clothes somewhat disheveled.

"What are you making a fuss about in the middle of the night?"

Mia was clinging to him, looking at me with seductive eyes and a smile.

"What trick is big sister trying to play now? Mr. Winters is quite busy, you know."

"My brother needs surgery! Caleb, take me to the hospital, please!"

I rushed forward to grab his arm, but he shook me off in disgust.

"Aria Sinclair, haven't you had enough of this act?"

Mia whispered in his ear: "Mr. Winters, I think she's just trying to get your attention like this. What a manipulative bitch."

Caleb pinched Mia's chin, smiling. "You're such a good girl."

When he looked at me again, his eyes were cold as ice: "Weren't you so good at crawling back then? All the way from my family's doorstep, making my mom soft-hearted enough to take you in. Now if you want to go to the hospital, you can crawl there yourself."

Mia laughed, looking at me with triumphant eyes.

Caleb no longer looked at me. He left with his arm around Mia, slamming the door again.

"Caleb Winters!"

No matter how I shouted, there was no more movement outside.

This won't do. I can't wait!

I looked around this small room. The windows were sealed with iron bars.

The only way out was that door.

I found a broken mop handle and tried to pry the door lock with all my strength.

The lock was very sturdy. It didn't budge after several attempts.

Time ticked by, and I was frantic with worry.

I spotted a fire extinguisher in the corner. Without thinking, I grabbed it and smashed it against the door lock!

The loud noise was particularly jarring, but finally, the lock was broken!

I rushed towards the main door as fast as I could.

The security guards tried to stop me, but I just kept running, heedless.

Rain mixed with tears blurred my face, biting cold.

Just when I despairingly thought I would run my legs off, a beam of headlights illuminated me.

The window lowered, revealing a sharply defined profile. It was Caleb's uncle, Lucas Winters.

"Get in," he said concisely.

I practically crawled into the passenger seat on all fours. With no time for thanks, I blurted out the name of the hospital incoherently.

He said nothing more, driving quickly towards Central Hospital.

As I got out of the car, Lucas handed me a business card, telling me: "If you encounter any trouble you can't solve in the future, try contacting this number. Remember, you are your own person first."

My mind was in chaos. I clutched the card and ran out of the car.

Rushing into the emergency room, I grabbed a nurse and asked, "Alex Sinclair! How is my brother Alex Sinclair?"

The nurse looked at me, her face full of hesitant sympathy.

The door of the nearby operating room opened just then. The doctor walked out wearily, taking off his mask.

"We did our best."

"The patient insisted on having that surgery himself. The success rate wasn't high, but he persisted, saying he wanted to stand up, to give his sister a surprise..."

The doctor sighed, "This is the letter he wrote before the surgery, asking us to pass it on to you."

The nurse stuffed a letter into my hand.

"Sis, by the time you read this letter, I might have succeeded, or... I might have gone to find Dad. Don't cry, big sis."

"I know how much you've suffered for Mom and me all these years. It's all because I've been holding you back. I want to stand up. I don't want to watch you being bullied by Caleb anymore."

"The doctor said there's a new surgery. Although it's a bit risky, what if it works? I want to stand in front of you like a man and tell you that I can take care of you now."

"Sis, none of this is your fault. Don't blame yourself. If it fails... don't be sad either. I'm just going to find Dad. He must miss me too. You have to live well, live for our share too."

"Your brother who will always love you, Alex."

I hugged that letter, sitting in the hospital corridor, crying my heart out.
