Brooke froze for a moment, then her face lit up with wild joy.
The music in the club was pounding, giving me a headache, so I frowned, wanting to leave.
But as soon as I stood up, Brooke and her little posse of friends pushed me back down onto the booth seat.
A sharp pain shot through my shoulder as she yanked my bag off, pulling out my phone.
Seeing the phone still on the recording interface, her face instantly changed.
“I knew you weren’t that nice! You act all sweet in front of me, but you’re secretly recording me, planning to run home and tell Mom and Dad, aren’t you?!”
I sighed. “You can delete the recording. I promise I won’t tell Mom and Dad.”
In my previous life, I had indeed used that recording to convince Mom and Dad that this job wasn't legitimate.
That’s why they locked Brooke at home.
But this time, I was determined to just observe, so the recording no longer mattered.
Brooke quickly deleted the recording and was about to hand my phone back when Cassie snatched it away.
“Your sister is so smart. They say a cunning rabbit has three burrows, she probably doesn’t just have one recording device, does she?”
Brooke suddenly understood, pointing at me and cursing, demanding I hand over all recordings.
I was pinned to the seat, trying my best to calmly explain to her.
Brooke turned my bag inside out but didn’t find any other devices.
Cassie smirked, a cold smile playing on her lips. “We have quite a few clients on the yacht who hide tiny cameras on themselves. Could it be…?”
Brooke’s face instantly darkened.
She pounced on me, tearing off my dress.
The little tough girls nearby cheered, pulling out their phones to take pictures.
“Whoa, Brooke, your sister has a banging body!”
Humiliated, I desperately covered myself, an overwhelming sense of shame washing over me.
It wasn't until I was completely naked that Brooke finally snorted and let me go.
“Brooke, you came to the club to meddle with me, so you brought this humiliation upon yourself!”
I huddled under the table, trying to cover myself with the dress, begging them to let me leave.
Cassie’s gaze lingered on my body, full of meaning, and she suddenly suggested I come along for the yacht gig too.
She hesitated for a rare moment. “But… wouldn’t that be a bit much?”
Cassie flashed a wide smile. “Twin yacht girls as gorgeous as you two? The price would be at least five times higher, you know.”
“Besides, if she comes with us, we can make sure she won’t run back and tell tales, right?”
Brooke was instantly convinced.
Then, under Cassie’s direction, the tough girls force-fed me a large amount of alcohol.
My limbs felt weak from the drunkenness.
Cassie had Brooke and me pose for a set of sexy twin photos.
“If you don’t want your family, friends, or even your future college classmates to see these photos,
You’d better behave tomorrow and perform well, understand?”
That idiot Brooke even seemed a little displeased.
“Cassie! You said I’d be the main attraction tomorrow!”
Cassie casually brushed her off, a hint of disdain in her eyes.
By the time I fully sobered up, it was already late into the night.
Everyone lay sprawled across the sofas, deeply asleep.
Thinking of the consequences of being taken onto that yacht,
I gritted my teeth and knocked over the drinks and scented candles on the table.
The club room was filled with highly flammable items, and the flames quickly turned into billowing smoke.
Security guards rushed in frantically with fire extinguishers.
The moment the room door burst open, I crouched low and dashed out.
Ignoring the roars and piercing screams behind me, I ran like mad, tearing out of the club.
After running for what felt like ages, I finally reached home.
Before my tensed nerves could relax, the living room lights suddenly flickered on.
“Why are you back alone?! Where’s your sister?!”
They seemed oblivious to my disheveled appearance, relentlessly hounding me about Brooke’s whereabouts.
I was just about to speak.
Dad raised his hand and viciously slapped me across the face.
“Don’t tell me your sister met bad people out there!
I’m telling you, Brooke *has* to go out to sea! She’s going to be the CEO’s wife…”
In that instant, I confirmed that Mom and Dad had also been reborn.
They showed no remorse for having caused my death.
All they wanted was to send Brooke off to sea.
Mom quickly nudged Dad’s arm, signaling him not to let slip.
A mix of bitterness and resentment swelled in my heart.
I took a deep breath and insisted I had no idea where Brooke went.
They exchanged confused glances.
The next second, the phone rang.
A strong sense of unease rose within me.
While Dad was on the phone, I quietly began to retreat towards the door.
“What! You’re taking your sister to the gig tomorrow?!”
“No, you can’t take her! You go alone… Dad means that kind of good fortune isn’t for your sister…”
I immediately turned to run.
Unexpectedly, Mom mercilessly kicked me hard in the lower back.
I cried out in pain, clutching my waist as I collapsed to the floor, tears streaming down my face.
After Dad hung up, he whispered a few words to Mom.
Mom immediately turned and fetched a plate of peanuts.
Alarm bells screamed in my head.
