Christmas Eve. Mom suffered a sudden brain hemorrhage and was rushed to the ICU.

I called my husband Ryan. His ex-girlfriend Celeste answered.

"He's in the shower. Can I take a message?"

A few hours later, Celeste updated her social media:

"This boutique couples' hotel has such amazing vibes! Definitely coming back with my boyfriend~"

The photos showed clothes strewn across the floor and several used condoms.

Ryan texted me:

"Working late. Be home as soon as I can."

I didn't cry. 

A man who cheats is garbage, and I don't want anymore.


The OR light stayed on. I leaned weakly against the wall, my hand trembling as I gripped my phone.

Friends and family showed up one after another.

"Jade, how's your mom?"

"Jade, what did the doctors say?"

"Jade, isn't Ryan here with you?"

I kept my head down. I had no idea what to say.

After Mom was brought to the hospital, the doctor immediately issued a critical condition notice.

I watched doctor after doctor go into the OR, but none came back out.

As for Ryan?

Was I supposed to tell them he'd just posted on social media—photos from a boutique hotel with Celeste?

I could only keep my head down and nurse my wounds alone.

Ryan's parents arrived.

When Harold didn't see Ryan, his face darkened. He immediately pulled out his phone to call him.

"Where the hell are you? Get over here right now—"

Before Harold could finish, Ryan's irritated voice came through:

"Dad, did Jade complain to you again? I'm working late at the office. She knows that!"

Margaret spoke up. "Ryan, you—"

"Mom, don't. I can handle things with her. You and Dad don't need to get involved."

"I'm swamped here. Gotta go."

Margaret looked at me awkwardly.

Harold's face turned red with rage. He was about to call again.

I forced a weak smile. "Dad, if he's working, let's leave him be."

After I said that, all the strength seemed to drain from my body. I slowly slid down the wall.

The friends and family around me were clearly upset with Ryan.

He was my husband, Mom's son-in-law. When my mom was fighting for her life, no matter what he was busy with, he should've been here.

But he wasn't.

The operating room light went out. The door opened.

I looked up with desperate hope, only to see the doctors' grim faces.

My body trembled. I couldn't believe it. Step by step, I walked toward the operating room.

When I finally saw Mom's body, tears flooded out of me like a broken dam.

In that moment, I could no longer lie to myself.

There was no one left in this world who would love me unconditionally.

I told his parents and everyone else to go home—I didn't want anyone staying with me at the hospital.

I stayed with Mom all night.

The next morning, I called a funeral home to arrange for Mom's body and plan the service.

Watching them take Mom's body away, I pulled out my phone and texted Ryan.

[Mom passed away.]

I so badly wanted him to call right away, to rush to my side and hold me.

But my message went unanswered, like a stone sinking in water.

I let out a bitter laugh and wiped the tears from my face.

I'd loved Ryan for ten years—love at first sight, five years of friendship, three years of dating, and two years of marriage.

I'd grown used to having him around.

But from now on, I'd have to get used to life without him.
