I closed my eyes, but all I could see was the blood staining the ground when my daughter died.

I wouldn't let a single one of these despicable people off the hook. I had to plan my moves carefully.

Lucas was my family's live-in son-in-law, currently working an entry-level job at my father's company.

Perhaps it was my wealth that motivated him, but he had perfectly played the role of devoted husband in front of everyone.

In my past life, everyone - including me - thought I had found the world's best husband.

It wasn't until I was dying that I learned the truth.

He called it "enduring humiliation to achieve his goals." He had acted the part so well, all for a beautiful future with his true love.

His lover Chloe had deliberately gotten pregnant at the same time as me, even having a C-section early to facilitate switching our babies.

Being premature, that little bastard had been small and weak at birth.

In my past life, I had spared no effort to nurse her to health.

She certainly grew strong - strong enough to easily push me into that freezing river.

Lucas was the husband my father had carefully chosen for me.

Dad said he didn't want me working too hard, that I needed someone to help shoulder the burden of the family business. He had picked Lucas from among the scholarship students he sponsored.

Dad said Lucas was handsome, well-behaved, and hardworking - a young man with great potential.

My mom had insisted I should marry someone from a similar background.

But I was captivated by Lucas's surface charm. I agreed to the marriage and even convinced my reluctant mom.

That's how the wedding went ahead.

Looking back now, I was truly blind and foolish.

I never saw the ugly face beneath Lucas's human mask.

It's impossible to know exactly when Lucas and Chloe first got together.

But since Chloe's due date was after mine, he must have been cheating during my pregnancy at the very least.

Due to my delicate health, I had focused all my attention on the baby after getting pregnant. I had gradually handed over my responsibilities in the family business to Lucas.

This time around, Lucas wouldn't get his hands on a single cent of my family's wealth.

Once my condition stabilized, I moved into the luxury maternity center I had booked in advance.

The background check on Lucas before our marriage had been woefully inadequate.

We hadn't uncovered the fact that he had a lover he couldn't forget.

I contacted Uncle Wilson, our company's head of security, and asked him to conduct a thorough investigation into Lucas's past.

The fact that Lucas had managed to deceive professional investigators before meant he must have been planning this for a long time.

He had claimed his background was simple - parents deceased, not much contact with other relatives.

My parents and I had felt so sorry for his circumstances. We bent over backwards trying to make him feel loved, wanting him to experience the warmth of family.

Even I had tried hard to rein in my spoiled rich girl tendencies, afraid of hurting his fragile heart.

Looking back now, I was truly an utter fool.

That beast who could throw his own daughter to the beggars deserved to have his family destroyed and end up completely alone.

The company kept me busy, so most of the time it was just me and the little bastard alone together.

Looking at this inherently evil creature, this white-eyed wolf who could never be tamed, I had to grip my right hand tightly with my left to keep from strangling her.

My precious baby was out there suffering who knows where, while this vile offspring lay in the most luxurious maternity center.

Perhaps my gaze was too icy, because the little bastard started crying.

With a couple soft sounds, the brat soiled herself.

In my past life, I had forced myself to overcome my germaphobia, changing her diapers and wiping her bottom countless times.

This time? Dream on. Even if diaper rash spread all over her face, what did it have to do with me?

I had already refused to breastfeed. Though Lucas tried to hide it, I still caught the vicious look in his eyes. Hah, he was surely thinking of how he'd settle accounts with me later.

Too bad. This time around, I would be the one settling accounts.

Without my support, that penniless live-in son-in-law wouldn't even be able to afford a hot meal.

No matter how resentful he felt, he'd have to swallow it.

My thoughtful parents sent over some imported premium formula. I rejected it outright. Chinese babies should have Chinese formula - the 100 yuan a can kind was good enough.

Even the maternity center staff seemed to disapprove of me.

They whispered that despite my family's wealth, I was being so stingy with an innocent baby. Some even suspected I must be extremely biased against girls.

Separated by two lives, if I had my way I wouldn't even spend 100 yuan on her.

The bastard child kept squirming and crying, her face turning red.

I stared at her, quietly savoring the moment.

Cry all you want. This is just the beginning. Your whole life is destined to be filled with tears.

Your tears will be the funeral dirge for your vile parents.

I ignored the nurse's urgent knocking at the door.
