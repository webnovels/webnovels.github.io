Finally the little beast cried herself to sleep, lying in her own filth.

My mom arrived then, out of breath and sweating.

"Sweetie, what's wrong? The nurse said the baby was crying terribly and asked me to come check."

I rubbed my eyes in confusion. "Was she crying? I didn't hear anything."

"The nurse said the baby was wailing, but your door was locked and they couldn't get it open. I was so worried something had happened!"

Mom went over to check on the imposter child.

"Oh, look at this little rascal sleeping so peacefully."

A newborn's poop doesn't have much odor. I had deliberately placed some fresh flowers nearby, so Mom didn't notice anything amiss.

I reached out to wipe the sweat from Mom's forehead. "Don't worry, Mom. I'm fine. I'm just exhausted after giving birth. I probably slept through the crying."

"Honey, is something bothering you?" Mom looked at me with loving concern.

I forced a relaxed smile. "Please don't worry. I'm doing great, nothing's wrong. You're overthinking things."

My mom, so focused on me, had noticed something was off.

She pulled me into a hug. "No matter how old you get, you'll always be Mommy's little princess."

Leaning on Mom's shoulder, I felt an unprecedented sense of warmth and security.

Suddenly my whole body was filled with strength.

This must be the power of a mother's love. In this life, I would become my daughter's pillar of strength.

"How are you and Dad doing health-wise?" I changed the subject.

Mom gently stroked my hair. "We're doing great. Once Lucas is fully familiar with the company operations, your dad and I can retire with peace of mind and help you raise the baby."

Every hair on my body stood on end.

Desperately suppressing my panic, I managed a strained smile.

"Lucas is still young. He's not ready for such a big responsibility. The company still needs pillars of strength like you and Dad."

If I remember correctly, in my past life I gradually stepped back from the company after giving birth to focus on being a wife and mother.

My parents had felt comfortable slowly handing things over to Lucas. He was quickly promoted to deputy general manager.

Later, I even happily gave him my position as general manager.

In my past life, I had deluded myself into thinking I'd found the world's best husband.

Lucas did have good business acumen. Under his leadership, our family company flourished.

I was truly blind and foolish not to see through that wolf in sheep's clothing.

Mom smiled and said, "Lucas really is quite capable. Don't worry, everything your father and I have will be yours. Your dad is already considering promoting Lucas to deputy general manager."

Keeping my expression neutral, I tried to intervene. "Mom, there's no rush. Young people need more tempering to grow. I think Lucas's abilities are still lacking. You and Dad should think it over carefully."

Hah, now that I'm living this life over, how could I possibly devote myself wholeheartedly to him?

A promotion? Keep dreaming!

As long as I'm around, he'll never be more than a lowly employee.

Mom looked at me in confusion. "Did you two have a fight? Why are you suddenly saying this?"

"You don't appreciate your parents until you become one yourself. I understand now how difficult it was for you and Dad to build the business from scratch. We of the younger generation shouldn't take it for granted."

"You and Dad are still in your prime. Your 50s are the time to keep striving. Even when it comes time to choose a successor, it should go to the most capable person. That's how the company will develop best."

My sudden maturity left Mom a bit at a loss.

But she was touched, patting my shoulder approvingly.
