There were five years left until he turned thirty-five—maybe I could find a way to save him.

Even if not, with his looks and wealth, spending five years together wouldn't be a loss. Who knows, maybe I'd even have a little dumpling.

By then, all his assets would be mine. How could I pass up such a beneficial deal?

Liam Taylor said nothing, just held my gaze intensely. If not for his hand gripping my waist, I might have thought he was indifferent. His gaze grew deeper, and my heart beat wildly.

Everyone knows that the elite Taylor Family isn't intimidating. The only intimidating one is Liam Taylor. He took over the company at eighteen and, within two years, surpassed the leading company in New York City.

By twenty-five, he expanded the company internationally.

If not for the accident at twenty-seven, he would be a man many women could only dream of.

Even with his short life expectancy, my family's status isn't the Taylor Family's first choice.

Just as I was about to compromise and leave, he softly said, "Marry me. Alive or dead, you can only be my wife."

Hearing his terms, I quickly nodded in agreement.

Sworn with three fingers to the sky, I promised to marry only him in this life. Seeing his satisfied smile, I realized he agreed to the marriage exchange.

Meanwhile, in the video, the two were still plotting how to humiliate Liam Taylor and me the next day and gain benefits from Mrs.

Taylor. Watching the two-faced duo filled me with hatred.

If they wanted to ruin me, I'd return the favor. After whispering in Liam Taylor's ear, I dressed and headed to Fiona White's room. Before reaching the door, I already heard Fiona White's pleading voice inside.

"Stop it. If their drug effect wears off and they sneak out, tonight's plan will fall apart."

"Don't worry, I used a strong dose. Once we're done, we'll call the reporters.

Even if the old lady wants to protect him, Liam Taylor will have to leave the Taylor Family."

Their mocking voices sent a chill down my spine. Tonight, Fiona White used our best friend status as an excuse to hold a bachelorette party.

After just one drink, I felt dizzy, with waves of heat coursing through me.

When I came to, I was already in bed with Liam Taylor. Thinking of this, I ground my molars in anger.

For Fiona White, I gave my all. What I had, she had. What she liked, I'd buy for her. For her family's company, I asked my father for help more than once.

I even introduced my boyfriend, Finn Taylor, to her. Even a hair from the Taylor Family could keep her small company thriving for a month. But I never expected the two of them to sneak around together.

Taking a deep breath, I grabbed the key card Liam Taylor had prepared and kicked the door open. The two on the bed split apart in shock at the sudden noise.

They scrambled to cover themselves with the fallen blanket, looking like ants on a hot pan. Barely managing to cover their exposed skin, they looked up to see me pointing my phone at their faces.

Fiona White's face darkened instantly, and she yelled in anger, "Nora Bennett, are you crazy? What are you doing here instead of sleeping?"

"Nora Bennett?"

Before she finished her scolding, her face turned pale with fright. She reached out, trying to shove Finn Taylor under the covers.

Her panicked look made me laugh derisively, a slight sting at the tip of my nose.

"I treated you like a good sister, and you slept with my boyfriend. Do you have no shame?"

My question silenced Fiona White and made Finn Taylor feel sorry for her. Right in front of me, he pulled Fiona White into his arms, looking soft and tender.

"Nora, where's your upbringing? You barge in like a shrew, biting everyone. How can you compare to Fiona?"

Though he was the one caught cheating, and I hadn't even started questioning him, he turned the tables, acting like the victim.

Unable to contain my fury, I threw a nearby ashtray at them.

"She's my best friend and your uncle's fiancée. How can you justify this affair?"

Finn Taylor brushed it off with a wince, his face twisted in pain. He glared at me with vicious eyes. "Don't mention that good-for-nothing.

A doomed heir who thought he could marry Fiona and compete with me for the Taylor Family."

"If you're smart, you'll listen. The Taylor Family can still be yours. If not, forget about the marriage."

"Fine, let's call off the engagement. I have nothing to do with you anymore."

With those words, I slapped Finn Taylor across the face.

He hadn't expected me to suggest breaking off the engagement, and his face turned dark instantly.

Ignoring his state of undress, he got up and approached me.

"We can't break it off. You and my uncle..."

Before he could finish, his voice stopped abruptly. My vision went black, and I heard the sound of flesh hitting the floor. As I wondered, Liam Taylor's deep, magnetic voice sounded in my ear.

"You've agreed to marry me. Don't look at others, naughty."

Tsk, so domineering.
