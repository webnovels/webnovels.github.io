I was getting my car serviced at Serena's auto club. 
When they were done, I told the staff, "Just charge it to Serena's account."
The employee nodded, about to process it, but a male manager I didn't recognize blocked him.
"We don't do tabs here. Payment is due on the spot."
With that, he slapped the bill down in front of me.
Premium Detailed Diagnostic Fee: $80,000
Exhaust System Acoustic Charm Optimization: $100,000
Engine Spiritual Balance Calibration: $100,000
Total: $280,000.
I actually laughed. When did Serena start running such a scam?
The manager, Brandon, crossed his arms, sizing me up with disdain.
"Always trying to freeload under Serena's name. I've seen countless poor relatives like you. If you can't afford it, don't try to act like you're rich."
Without another word, I pulled out my phone and called Serena.
"You have ten minutes to get him out of here. Otherwise, there's no point in keeping this place open."

"Eleanor, isn't this… a misunderstanding?"
On the other end, Serena's voice was laced with guilt and panic.
"Misunderstanding?"
My voice instantly chilled.
"Do I look like someone who stirs up drama for no reason? I'm not calling to discuss, I'm calling to tell you to handle your people, immediately!"
Serena seemed taken aback by my tone. She quickly tried to appease me, "Eleanor, don't get mad. Just give the phone to Brandon. I'll ask him exactly what's going on."
I snorted and handed the phone to Brandon.
He pursed his lips, reluctantly taking the call.
"Didn't I tell you already? You need to cut ties with these freeloading relatives. All they do is use your name to get benefits. This time is even crazier, finishing the service and then trying to skip out on the bill."
Serena seemed to be explaining something on the phone, but Brandon wouldn't let her finish.
"Alright, stop talking. I know you're soft-hearted and care about family, always dragging your feet. I'll be the bad guy today!"
He hung up, tossed the phone back to me, his chin held high.
"Hear that? Serena can't be bothered with your nonsense. Stop stalling. It's $280,500 total, but we'll round it down, just $280,000!"
"Cash, card, or transfer? Make it quick, or I'll call security to escort you out right now!"
Brandon deliberately emphasized "escort," making his threat crystal clear.
Brandon's shamelessness and stupidity made me laugh again, but this time it was bitter.
In all these years, no one had dared to be so arrogant in front of me.
Just then, the VIP room door burst open, and Serena rushed in.
She hurried over, a fake, plastered smile on her face.
"Oh, Eleanor, look at this mess. Brandon, he's just too particular about things. Please don't take it to heart."
Before I could speak, Brandon bristled like a cat with its tail stepped on.
"Serena, aren't I doing this for your own good? Should I just let shady characters use your name to freeload and ruin the business? Will that make you happy?"
Brandon wrapped an arm around Serena's waist, shooting me a defiant look at the same time.
Seeing this, I'd be a fool not to understand.
I wondered why Brandon, just a manager, could be so arrogant. Turns out he had backup.
As if to confirm my suspicions, Serena forced a smile and played the emotional card.
"Eleanor, Brandon is my boyfriend. We're getting engaged next month. We'll all be family soon, always seeing each other. I'll pay this bill, okay?"
"No need!" I coldly refused.
Serena's attitude sent a chill down my spine. If I hadn't pitied her, my cousin, she'd still be pounding the pavement at job fairs.
The design, renovation, operational plans, network resources, even the startup capital for this auto club – I provided support for every single aspect.
But I'd been mindful of her pride back then, so I never personally showed my face. That's why she had no idea I was the real investor.
Yet now, for the sake of this short-sighted, nasty man, she was turning on me.
In that case, I didn't need to show any mercy.
