My two sons conspired to send me to a psychiatric hospital simply because I refused to have a third child with another man.

"Can't you understand the policy for three children? Since your mindset is problematic, you should reflect on it here!"

My eldest son spoke while the younger one looked at me with disdain:

"Exactly, you old fool! Someone is willing to let you have a child and give you a sense of worth, and yet you don't appreciate it!"

"If you can't give birth to a son, we won't take you out!"

I was trapped in this nightmare, enduring endless humiliation. I was forced to have a son with an orderly and had to endure the abuse from all the men in the hospital.

Two months later, my sons came with the whole family to pick me up, asking if I would behave. In front of everyone, I stripped and lifted my right leg like a dog:

"I'm about to get pregnant with a son! Please don't do this in front of my old partner, okay?"
