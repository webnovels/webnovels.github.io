I clicked into this tag and immediately froze. It was filled with Declan and Nora's "daily love life." The most shocking was a post from four years ago: Today is my brother's death anniversary, and Nora had a breakdown. She mistook me for you and instinctively called me "husband." But I stayed silent, couldn't agree. Because I met another girl whom I love dearly and want to marry. But don't worry, brother. Whatever my wife has, Nora will surely have too. So, he gave her a matching ring, ordered a similar wedding gown, and even the proposal was ceremonious. Anniversaries were fair too; last year he spent with me, this year was Nora's turn. He managed the balance skillfully.

Not long after, my phone buzzed with a message from Declan: "The wedding continues tomorrow, please be understanding." I stared at the screen, laughed coldly, and replied: "Okay." Then pocketed my phone. Since Declan wanted to keep acting, I had to end this charade myself.

The next day, the wedding venue was packed with guests. I walked arm in arm with Declan, step by step toward the stage. Suddenly, the doors swung open. As expected, Nora walked in wearing the same wedding gown as mine. At this moment, the banquet hall's big screen suddenly lit up. Instead of displaying our wedding photos, it showed Declan and Nora embracing in the bridal suite. He was gently putting on a wedding ring identical to mine for Nora. He said, "Nora, I'll take care of you for life." The timestamp was from six years ago. The whole room gasped. Nora's face was tear-streaked, looking like a tragic lover harshly separated by me. But she didn’t forget to hold up her phone to live-stream, and flashlights instantly focused on me. "Everyone, judge for yourselves. Declan and I have been in love for years, Genevieve is the mistress!"

The comments exploded.

"Whoa! Mistress caught at a high-profile wedding?!"

"The bride doesn't look like a good person!"

"Poor girl! Bravely pursuing love."

"Original partner turned mistress, drama of the year!"

Declan quickly turned to look at me. I gritted my teeth and said, "Declan, our wedding, why is there another leading lady?" Looking at Nora's convincingly fake face, I couldn't take this humiliation. I raised my hand to slap Nora, but Declan grabbed my hand. "Don't be impulsive, Nora is just emotionally unstable." I ignored him, grabbed a wine glass, and hurled it at her. Declan turned without hesitation, and red wine splashed all over his suit. Yet he shielded Nora, glaring at me, "Don't go crazy!" I shook off Declan's hand, stepped onto the stage, and grabbed the host's microphone. Then I displayed screenshots from Declan's private social media on the big screen.

"Don't worry, brother, I'll take good care of Nora for you."

"Everything my wife has, she'll have too."

Most glaring was a wedding photo with Nora. Below it read: "The wedding photo she wanted, I took for you too. I'll also figure out a way to fulfill the honeymoon for you and her." As soon as this image appeared, the whole room gasped again.

Suddenly, the wedding door was pushed open once more. A group of influencers with faces similar to Nora's rushed into the wedding venue holding signs saying "Share the love." I tore off my veil, revealing a bright red smile, and said, "Welcome to Declan's bachelor ceremony!" "Declan, these are all the influencers your brother had contact with." "Since you're so devoted, why not let them share the love too?"
