I stared at my phone screen, my fingernails digging into my palm.

Back at the bridal suite, before I could calm down, the doorbell rang. Two police officers stood outside.

"Are you Miss Genevieve? Someone reported you for a hit and run, please cooperate with the investigation."

I was stunned: "What? It was clearly Nora who rear-ended me!"

The police handed over a document expressionlessly.

"Your dashcam shows your car indeed collided with another car and left after the accident."

My dashcam?

Right after the incident, Declan took it, saying he needed to investigate the real situation.

At the police station, sure enough, there sat Declan and Nora side by side.

The woman showed her bruised thigh, letting Declan check it.

The comments flooded the screen: "So disgusting, hit someone and still wants to run!"

"Attorney Declan, hurry up and dump her."

"Honestly, Attorney Declan and our sister Nora look good together."

Then the police said, "Miss Genevieve, Miss Lin provided new evidence showing you indeed had the intention to flee after the collision."

I saw a heavily edited video, only showing me getting out of the car to "push" someone and turning my head. There was no context of Nora deliberately faking the accident, making me look like an arrogant rich girl.

"This is not complete."

Even then, I hadn’t grasped the situation, pointing at Declan.

"Just as well, my husband is right there."

"He's a lawyer; he'll represent me."

Declan walked over and suddenly said, "Nora is a friend of an old acquaintance, entrusted to my care."

"I'm now her attorney."

"My client has suffered severe emotional distress and demands you be held fully accountable."

I looked up, almost unable to believe my ears.

I slammed the table: "Declan, what acquaintance, give me a break!"

"You're treating your wife like this for some influencer, what do you take me for!"

"And you, Nora, aren't you tired of this self-directed drama?"

Declan remained unmoved, sternly saying, "Lydia, don't be ridiculous."

"Watch your words, or Miss Lin will add defamation charges."

The police awkwardly coughed: "Given the lack of evidence, we suggest mediation."

Just then, my attorney, whom I contacted after failing to reach Declan, rushed in.

During the mediation, Nora live-streamed the whole time.

Declan kept proposing harsh conditions: a public apology across the internet, compensation for medical expenses, deletion of all related comments...

Nora suddenly interjected: "The place I'm staying now is too far from the hospital, inconvenient for follow-ups..."

"You just said she'd take care of me for a few days, but I'm not used to living with others."

Declan immediately continued, "Lydia, then please move out of the bridal suite until she recovers."

Ha, at this point, nothing he says surprises me anymore.

"Don't worry, I'll divorce you and move out of the bridal suite."

But I just want to ask one question, even if I die, I want to die knowing the truth.

I looked Declan in the eyes: "Did you really cheat with someone like her?"

The man frowned and said, "Genevieve, speaking objectively, you hurt someone, and it's only right to apologize and make amends."

"Don't spread rumors; Nora and I are innocent."

"If I, Declan, have done anything to betray you, I'll leave the legal profession and die a horrible death!"

I was stunned.

He dared to curse himself like this; could it be that I've misunderstood?

But then what does all this happening before me mean?

Am I having a mental breakdown?
