Leaving the police station, I immediately contacted my best friend, Yara.

Since lawyers rely on evidence, I'll get you evidence.

Sure enough, I found records of his frequent contacts with Nora over the past six years.

Declan transferred money to Nora every month, ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.

The most laughable was the record from Christmas five years ago.

It was our first holiday after getting together, yet he said he had an urgent case.

At that time, I was starting my business and was struggling.

He left me alone in a shabby rental eating instant noodles.

But that day he transferred 200,000 to Nora.

There was also another document showing he owned an apartment where Nora had been living for the past year.

I remember this apartment; he bought it a year ago, and back then, he told me he was on a business trip.

So every time he said he was "working late" or "on a business trip," he was with her?

I clutched these documents but didn't know where to start, finding it odd.

All the transfer details were noted as "medical expenses."

Does this prove infidelity? It doesn't seem like concrete evidence of cheating.

I also asked someone to check Declan's phone and email but found no hotel reservations or intimate photos.

This was too unusual.

Just when I was at a loss, I found a recording of one of Nora's live streams.

Just a few days ago, she wore a diamond ring on her left ring finger, glaringly obvious.

It was identical to the engagement ring Declan gave me.

The comments scrolled wildly: "Is Nora getting married?"

"That ring's at least five carats!"

Nora covered her mouth with a coy smile, turned, and opened a wardrobe, pulling out an ivory-white wedding dress.

The dress was just like mine, even with the same embroidered rose pattern Declan suggested.

These images stabbed at my eyes, surely Declan got what he deserved!

I forwarded this evidence to him, but after three hours, still no explanation came.

Yet, I saw Declan in another of Nora's live streams.

The woman sat in an upscale restaurant, the background familiar with floor-to-ceiling windows and a piano performance area.

That was "Starlight Bay," where Declan and I confirmed our relationship.

The background music was playing "Dream Wedding."

It was the song Declan used when he confessed to me.

Suddenly, I remembered today was our five-year dating anniversary.

The man opposite Nora didn't appear on screen, but the hand with distinct joints wore the Rolex watch I gave him.

I forwarded the evidence to the man and waited for three hours without receiving any explanation. Then I saw Declan again in another of Nora's live streams. She was sitting in an upscale restaurant, with the familiar floor-to-ceiling window and piano area in the background. It was Starlight Bay, where Declan and I had solidified our relationship. The background music was playing "Dream Wedding," the song Declan used to confess his love to me. Suddenly, I remembered that today was our 5th anniversary. The man sitting across from Nora wasn’t in the frame, but his hand, distinct with its pronounced joints, wore the Rolex watch I had given him. The comments asked, "How long have you been together?" Nora replied, "Seven years today." I froze instantly. So, all these years, except for last year when he was with me, he always had excuses to be absent: overtime the year before, business trips, friends' weddings before that. It turns out I was the other woman all along.

I took a deep breath, forcing myself to stay calm. Then Adeline sent me another link, leading me to Declan's private social media account. The latest update was from ten minutes ago, showing a candlelight dinner identical to Nora's. But the caption read, "Seventh year, #fulfilling my brother's life#." My mind raced. A brother Declan never mentioned, fulfilling... What does this mean? Declan, what exactly are you hiding?
