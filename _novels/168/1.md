On the wedding day, I was driving the bridal car alone and got hit.

My forehead slammed into the front seat, causing sharp pain.

Before I could react, a woman with a phone rushed in front of my car, pointing the camera right at my face.

"Fam, look! The Rolls Royce lady hit someone and wants to run!"

I recognized her, the influencer Nora, with over ten million followers, the "epitome of allure."

The comments exploded immediately.

"Does having money make you superior?"

"That bride's makeup can't hide her scheming vibe!"

I clenched my wedding dress, about to explain when she suddenly screamed and fell: "She pushed me! My leg is broken!"

The live stream viewers shot up to 300,000.

Declan's call came faster than 911.

Seeing the call from my so-called "undefeated reputation" lawyer husband calmed my frantic emotions a bit.

Just as I wanted to ask him for help with this mess, the first thing he said was, "Apologize to her immediately."

"But she clearly..."

"Lydia!" His voice was gentle, as if coaxing a child. "Don't make it hard for me."

Five minutes later, his Mercedes screeched to a halt at the scene.

Ignoring the swelling on my forehead, Declan knelt to wipe Nora's tears.

He turned to me and coldly ordered, "Apologize in public!"

I was stunned: "Declan, aren't you going to ask what happened?"

He enunciated each word: "I said, apologize."

Nora suddenly added, "Besides an apology, I want 100,000 for medical and emotional distress."

Immediately, I heard him call the finance department: "Transfer 150,000 from the wedding fund to Miss Lin."

I stood there, too angry to think straight.

Nora smugly waved her phone: "Attorney Declan, you're really sensible."

"But just an apology and compensation won't do; my leg seems injured and needs an examination."

Then Declan turned to me: "Today's wedding is canceled and will be rescheduled."

"I'll take her to the hospital for a thorough checkup."

"What?!"

I almost shouted: "All the guests are waiting at the hotel!"

"I said, postponed." Declan's look brooked no argument.

The man supported Nora into the car, not even giving me an explanatory glance.

The whole internet watched my abandonment live, with a trending hashtag #SchemingBrideFails.

It wasn't until late at night that Declan messaged: "She has a concussion. You should prepare the guest room in the bridal suite and take care of her for a few days."

The bridesmaid who stayed with me all night smashed her phone in anger.

"That woman's knee bruise is drawn with concealer! The live replay shows she peeked at the camera before falling!"

She hesitated before warning me: "Declan's behavior is too abnormal."

"They don't seem like they're meeting for the first time."

I sneered; it's obvious from Declan's previous concern for Nora.

Even a blind person could tell what their relationship was.

But really, when did the cliché plot of a mistress power struggle become so blatant?
