It was Daniel Harper’s mother’s fiftieth birthday, and his female assistant, Tiffany, suddenly sent me a picture.

The photo showed Daniel’s mother locked in a dog cage, her teeth all pulled out, her mouth bloody.

I immediately called Tiffany:

“Tiffany, what are you doing?!”

Tiffany chuckled coldly.

“You have the nerve to ask? Daniel just opened a new restaurant, and your mother immediately shows up to freeload? Are you that desperate?”

“Let me tell you, Daniel gave this restaurant to me. If you want to take advantage, this is what happens!”

I gasped in disbelief.

“Are you insane? That’s Daniel’s mother!”

Tiffany sounded completely unfazed.

“Daniel said that even though he married you, he never considered your mother his family.”

Daniel loved his mother deeply. No wonder Tiffany dared to do this to Daniel’s mother – she thought it was my mother?


Tiffany hung up right after saying that.

I didn’t dare waste a second and immediately called Daniel.

“Daniel, your mom was hurt by Tiffany, you need to go…”

“Alright, I know what you’re going to say.”

Daniel cut me off, his voice chilling.

“I think Tiffany’s lesson was well-deserved.”

I froze. “What did you say?”

Daniel sighed, sounding exasperated.

“Scarlett, we might be married, but your mother needs to learn some basic boundaries. She can’t just keep looking for handouts and trying to scam me.”

I started to panic. “You’ve got it all wrong, that’s your…”

“Enough!”

Daniel snapped impatiently.

“So what? I’m not obligated to tolerate her greed.”

“She dares to scrounge for food at the restaurant today; tomorrow she’ll show up at my company asking for money.”

“Tiffany teaching her a lesson, making her remember, is actually for her own good.”

Daniel’s words instantly froze my frantic heart.

My mother, though from a rural background, had always been kind and honest her entire life. She’d never taken advantage of anyone and had given everything to Daniel.

When Daniel was starting his business and short on funds, my mother didn’t hesitate to give him all the retirement savings she’d accumulated over a lifetime.

Knowing he had a sensitive stomach, my mother, no matter how busy, would make time to prepare various stomach-friendly foods and travel a long way to the city to deliver them.

Yet, this simple, kind elderly woman who treated him like her own son had become, in Daniel’s eyes, a greedy wretch with no boundaries who deserved to be taught a lesson.

My heart ached with desolation, and my voice turned distant.

“Daniel, I suggest you go to the restaurant and check on your mother. After all, it wasn’t easy for her to raise you.”

Daniel exploded.

“Scarlett, are you out of your mind? When did your mother ever raise me?”

“No wonder Tiffany couldn’t help but teach your mother a lesson. With a daughter like you, she deserved to be hit!”

“Today is my mother’s fiftieth birthday. I’m still preparing her party, I don’t have time for your messy nonsense.”

“If you have any conscience at all, stay out of this and let your mother learn her lesson.”

With that, Daniel abruptly hung up.

A few seconds later, he sent me a text message:

“In an hour, my mother’s birthday party will start promptly at the Marriott Hotel. Get dressed and come over. Don’t embarrass me like your mother.”

I didn’t say anything more, just silently texted back: “Okay.”

Since you, her son, are telling me to mind my own business,

then why should I worry?
