On the drive home, Alex was unusually quiet.
He didn't speak, and I had no desire to talk either.
"Remember your promise - I'm taking you tomorrow."
Just as I was about to get out of the car, he suddenly locked the doors.
I wanted to refuse, but seeing the stubborn look in his eyes, I changed my mind.
"Don't worry, I haven't forgotten."
I smiled reassuringly at him and gave him an "okay" sign.
Only then did he unlock the doors.
As Alex's car roared off into the distance, I stood lost in thought.
He and Ethan used to be best friends.
They grew up together, closer than brothers.
Before I started dating Ethan, Alex had publicly given me a love letter.
When I rejected him, he brazenly declared he "wouldn't give up until the Yellow River ran clear."
After Ethan and I got together, Alex started dating too, but his relationships never lasted long.
I thought his interest in me had just been a passing fancy.
But he gradually withdrew from Ethan's life and mine, eventually becoming estranged from Ethan.
I had assumed our paths would never cross again.
But when my family hit hard times, it was Alex who stayed with me through countless difficult days and nights at the hospital.
He even acted as a smokescreen, successfully getting Evelyn to lower her guard against me.
Apart from my parents, I have two regrets in the first half of my life.
One is letting Ethan down, and the other is not being able to return Alex's love...
The night grew colder, the wind stinging any exposed skin.
I wrapped my scarf tightly around my face and turned towards the apartment building.
A car's hazard lights suddenly flashed a short distance away.
In the glow of the streetlights, I could make out the driver.
It was James, Evelyn's trusted chauffeur.
I couldn't help but let out a cold laugh.
They really were relentless.
I quickened my pace and got into the passenger seat. "What is it?"
"Miss Olivia, please pack your things. We're leaving tonight." His voice was as gruff as ever.
"Wasn't the train ticket for 6am tomorrow?" I turned to look at him. "Is Mrs. Shen so impatient she can't even wait one night?"
He said nothing, just placed his phone on the center console.
It was on speaker, mid-call.
"Does Miss Olivia have a problem with this arrangement?" Sophia's voice came through the speaker.
Arrogant and domineering, completely different from her demure act earlier.
"I wouldn't dare." I frowned slightly, smiling. "I just want to know if this is Mrs. Shen's idea or Miss Jiang's?"
"Does it matter?" She let out a derisive snort.
"Whoever's idea it is, Miss Olivia just needs to know that Mrs. Shen will only feel at ease once you're gone."
She paused. "And so will I."
Remembering the figure I glimpsed leaving earlier, I let out a mocking laugh.
One encounter and she was already on guard against me.
And me? What had I done to deserve this?
"I'll go, then." I couldn't be bothered to argue. I got out of the car and headed upstairs.
I had already packed most of my things. What was left were just everyday items.
After finishing up, I zipped my suitcase closed and took one last look around.
This apartment was bought by my parents.
We had lived here for over 20 years. Every corner held traces of our family.
But now everything had changed. Even the property deed had been transferred.
I left the keys on the shoe cabinet by the door, locked up, and headed downstairs with my suitcase.
As the car drove towards the highway, I opened my phone to send a farewell message to the new owner.
My eye caught on the unsent message from earlier.
I no longer felt that urge to challenge Evelyn.
I put my phone away and gazed out the window, silently saying goodbye to this chapter of my life.
The city lights illuminated the inky night sky. Skyscrapers stretched as far as the eye could see, neon signs glaring.
This city had been home to countless lonely souls, had witnessed the joys and sorrows of so many lives.
But it was no longer a place where I belonged...
