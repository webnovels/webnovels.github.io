The car kept driving further and further out of the way.

It wasn't until I recognized the familiar estate that I realized James had brought me to the Shen family home.

"The madam wanted to say goodbye to Miss Olivia in person."

James parked the car and politely opened my door.

"Is that really necessary?" I didn't budge.

I had only been here a handful of times, but each visit was unforgettable.

And not in a good way.

I had no desire to set foot here again.

"I'm just following orders," he looked at me steadily. "Please don't make this difficult for me, Miss Olivia."

I sat stubbornly in the car, locked in a stalemate with him.

The cold night air seeped in, dispelling the warmth of the car heater. I shivered.

"The young master doesn't live here anymore," he added after a long pause.

Only then did I get out of the car.

I was led through the grand entrance and into the receiving room, where I found Evelyn watching financial news on TV.

Though nearly 50, her skin was still smooth and youthful.

Illuminated by the crystal chandelier, she seemed to glow.

"Here's your ID. James will escort you to the station."

She lowered the TV volume and handed me an ID card after I sat down across from her.

The photo showed a girl who looked somewhat similar to me.

"You really went to great lengths to cover my tracks, Mrs. Shen."

I smiled. "When will I get my real documents back?"

"After Ethan marries the Jiang girl."

She slid a new phone across the table to me. "Until then, I hope Miss Olivia will behave herself."

I immediately understood her meaning: she was confiscating my phone.

My throat suddenly felt tight.

It wasn't enough to withhold my household registration and ID. Now she wanted to cut off all my connections too?

"And if I refuse?"

I clutched my phone tightly through my clothes.

This phone was a gift from Ethan five years ago. It was part of a matching couple set.

It had started to lag and crash lately from overuse.

I had so many precious memories stored on it that I couldn't bear to replace it. Even a small scratch made me anxious...

"I don't want anyone coveting my future daughter-in-law's husband."

She pushed the new phone towards me again. "Miss Olivia, don't make me use force."

With one sentence, she made the relationships and her stance crystal clear.

Knowing I had no way out, I reluctantly took out my phone and placed it on the table.

"James, take care of it." She gestured.

James picked up the phone, removed the SIM card and snapped both in half, then crushed the phone with his bare hands.

I watched helplessly as my phone was destroyed beyond repair.

"Thank you for your cooperation, Miss Olivia." Evelyn nodded in satisfaction.

"If you're thanking me for obediently following your orders these past three years, I accept."

My gaze swept over the mangled remains of my phone. "But if you're thanking me for my powerlessness to refuse just now, there's no need."

"Life is long, Miss Olivia. You're still young - you need to learn to look forward."

She raised her chin and instructed James, "It's late. Take Miss Olivia to the station."

"Yes, ma'am." James responded.

I got up silently and headed for the door, my head bowed.

James hurried ahead and stuffed the new phone into my hand.

I accepted it numbly.

"Olivia—"

Just as James was about to open the door, Evelyn spoke again.

I turned back like a puppet on strings.

"Stay alive. No one wants to fight over a dead person."

She sat with her arms crossed, radiating authority.

I let out a humorless laugh.

All these years, she had treated me like a thief, guarding against my every move.

Now she destroyed my phone before I left, paranoid that I might reconnect with Ethan.

But Ethan was far too proud. After being hurt by me multiple times, how could he possibly look back?

The most ridiculous part was that after doing so many despicable things, she could still bring herself to wish me a long life...

"Understood."

I responded coldly and walked out past James.

As soon as the door opened, I froze in my tracks.

Ethan was standing right outside.

He stood tall and straight, his breathing steady.

But those dark eyes burned with a quiet intensity.
