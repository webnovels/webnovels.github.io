I threw up violently in the bathroom.
When I came out, I immediately spotted a tall figure lurking in the shadows.
People were coming and going from the nearby private rooms. The flashing lights illuminated his face, revealing a storm of anger.
It was Ethan.
My body reacted before my mind could catch up. I spun around and ran.
I was fast, but Ethan was faster. I had barely taken a step when he grabbed me by the shoulder.
"Running away from me? Feeling guilty?"
His grip was painfully tight.
I tried to shake off his hold, but it was useless.
"Guilty about what?" I laughed hoarsely. "I just didn't see any point in catching up with you."
"Olivia, you hang around under my nose all night and now you say that? Isn't it a bit late?"
His voice was ice cold.
"What do you mean 'hanging around under your nose'? Am I not allowed to attend my own class reunion just because we broke up?"
I straightened my back and turned to face him, slapping his hand away.
"If that's the case, why were you hiding in the bathroom throwing up?" He grabbed my chin, forcing me to look at him. "Pregnant with someone's baby? Or just disgusted?"
The memory of him kissing Sophia flashed through my mind, making my stomach churn again.
I had to use all my willpower not to throw up right there.
"Didn't eat much, but you sure threw up a lot," he commented lazily when I didn't respond.
His words stung, making my eyes burn with unshed tears.
"Ethan, we're over. What the hell do you want from me?"
I shoved him hard, but he caught my hands and pinned me against the wall.
"I should be asking you that," he leaned in close. "If you disappeared, why come back now?"
The disgust and hatred in his eyes were unmistakable.
My blood ran cold. I let out a bitter laugh.
"What answer do you want to hear? That I can't forget you and want to rekindle our love? Or that I regret everything and I'm begging for your forgiveness?"
He didn't say anything.
He really did seem to want some kind of explanation.
"Of course it's—"
"She came with me."
Before I could finish, a man's amused voice cut in.
A few steps away, Alex stood with his hands casually in his pockets. Who knows how long he had been watching from around the corner.
"Bros before hoes, Ethan. You're crossing a line here."
He added nonchalantly.
"You... what do you mean?" Ethan's voice suddenly shook.
"I mean Olivia is my girlfriend now."
"I'm a year older than you, by the way. What, you're allowed to have a fiancée but I can't date?"
Alex lazily rolled up his shirt sleeves.
He looked ready to throw hands if Ethan didn't let go of me soon.
"You two are really... together?" Ethan's gaze returned to me.
Even in the dim light, I could feel the intensity of his stare.
"Need us to make out to prove it?" I smirked coldly.
"Do whatever you want..."
Ethan released me and walked away.
Alex let out a low whistle, a sly, victorious smile playing on his lips.
My carefully constructed mask crumbled. I slumped against the wall and closed my eyes wearily.
"I told you not to come. Now look what happened - you brought this on yourself."
Alex grumbled irritably.
I opened my eyes and looked at him. "Some things can't be delegated to others."
When he found out I was meeting with our doctor classmate, he had offered to ask on my behalf. I refused.
Because I needed to hear the truth for myself.
"You can fool yourself when it comes to feelings, but you can't fool others."
Alex stepped in front of me, leaning one hand against the wall by my head as he looked down at me.
"Liv, I've waited for you for seven years, and you've never given me the time of day."
"Just now when he was publicly humiliating you, I wanted to punch his lights out but you wouldn't let me."
"Is he really so great that you're still pining for him after three years apart?"
Though his words were harsh, his tone was filled with poorly concealed pain.
I wrapped my arms around his waist and buried my face in his chest.
He noticeably stiffened.
"Alex, some protection has nothing to do with love. There aren't many second chances in life."
"Back then, I refused to see him even when he was begging. Showing up today was bound to upset him."
"If cursing me out a bit makes him feel better, I'll take it. It's my fault for coming here with an agenda."
I patiently explained.
"Did you find out what you needed to know?" Alex sighed.
I nodded slightly.
"Then let's go." He ruffled my hair. "I'll go get the car and meet you out front."
"Okay." I reluctantly let go of him.
Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a figure quietly slip away...
