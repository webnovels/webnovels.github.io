The stepsister of Brooklyn Smith's husband, Samantha Zeller, left a little boy locked inside a car for over an hour under the scorching sun. Furthermore, she refused to let the police break the windows to save him. 

Brooklyn rushed to the scene in a panic, grabbed a hammer, and tried to break into the car. However, her husband, Christopher Zeller, stood in her way. 

"The red stains are probably ketchup that Robert accidentally smeared on the window. This car belonged to Samantha's late parents. She cares about it more than anything else in this world. We definitely can't break the window. 

"Samantha lost the keys to the car by mistake, and the spare key will be here in two minutes. Nothing bad will happen to our son. It's just another two minutes." Christopher spoke in a calm tone as he met Brooklyn's bloodshot eyes. 

"Is a car more important to you than your son's life?" Brooklyn demanded. 

She swung the hammer around wildly, breaking free from Christopher's grasp. She rushed up to the car and brought the hammer down on the window.

Samantha's shrill scream pierced the air as the glass window shattered into pieces, revealing Robert's pale and unconscious face. 

Tears streamed down Brooklyn's face. She shoved Christopher's hand aside when he stepped up to carry their son. 

At the emergency room, the doctor remarked that it would have been too late to save Robert if they had arrived two minutes later. 

Brooklyn glared at Christopher, tears welling up in her eyes. Her body was still trembling with fear and fury at what might have happened.

Brooklyn raised her hand and slapped Christopher hard across the face. She even turned around to slap Samantha too.

Samantha clutched her cheek, her wide eyes glistening with tears. "I only wanted to take Robert out to play. If you can't stand having me here, I'll just leave." She ran out of the room, sobbing. 

Christopher hesitated for a moment before chasing after her. 

It wasn't until evening, when Robert had come out of the emergency room for a second time, that Christopher returned to the hospital with his brows furrowed. 

He said, "Samantha's missing. She's a sensitive woman, and she may resort to doing something foolish. Brooklyn, please record an apology video while slapping yourself ten times. After that, can you post the video online?"

An apology.

Ever since Samantha moved in after finishing graduate school abroad, Brooklyn had been apologizing to her like a broken record. 

"Sorry, I didn't know you hated plain pasta."

"Sorry for disturbing your sleep by closing the door too loudly when I came home late from work."

"Sorry, I didn't mean to exclude you on purpose when I went out shopping with Christopher."

Brooklyn dug her nails deep into her bloodied palm and slowly looked up at Christopher. "Get lost!"

Christopher's expression darkened. He stepped forward and grabbed the oxygen mask on their son's face. "You're her sister-in-law. Can't you be a little more magnanimous?"

Brooklyn felt as if she was struck by lightning. She stared at the man she thought she once knew and said, "This is the second time Samantha locked our son inside a car. Do you really not know whether it was on purpose or an accident?"

"Don't change the subject. It's dangerous for a young lady like Samantha to be alone outside in the middle of the night." Christopher's voice turned icy, and he spoke with finality, "I'll give you one minute."

Robert's face was pale as he lay still on the hospital bed. His father, who was supposed to be protecting him, actually held him hostage for the sake of the person who nearly killed him!

"Brooklyn, don't make me do this." Christopher lifted the mask from Robert's face, and the vitals monitor sounded a piercing alarm. 

Brooklyn's heart pounded like a hammer within her chest as she screamed, "Fine, I'll slap myself!"

The first slap echoed in the ward, shattering every sweet memory they shared in the past. 

The second slap sent the future of their family crumbling to dust. 

Brooklyn used up every ounce of strength she had by the tenth slap. She leaned against the wall and slid to the floor. Meanwhile, Christopher walked away briskly. He called his assistant to upload the apology video across every social media platform. 

The next afternoon, Brooklyn was on her way to speak with the attending doctor when she overheard Samantha's coquettish voice in the stairwell. 

"Chris, I didn't cause a scene today for your sake. Don't you think I deserve a reward for being so well-behaved?"

Brooklyn peeked inside and saw Samantha wrapping her arms around Christopher's neck. Samantha stood on tiptoe before kissing him on the lips. 

However, Christopher didn't push her away. Instead, he placed his hand on her waist and tightened his grip instinctively. 

After a moment, he seemed to have suddenly come to his senses. Pushing Samantha away, Christopher spoke in an affectionate yet helpless tone. "Samantha, you should be more careful in public. After all, I'm your stepbrother."

Samantha pouted. "But we're not related by blood. Besides, I liked you long before Brooklyn did."

"You can't do this next time." Christopher ruffled Samantha's hair with a tenderness in his eyes that Brooklyn had never seen before. The sight pierced into her heart like a sharp blade. 

Brooklyn had heard rumors regarding Christopher and his stepsister when she was in college. However, she hadn't believed in them because Christopher had pursued her with such furor back then. 

Brooklyn had once casually mentioned that she didn't like boring and aloof men. 

Thus, Christopher entered the campus singing competition just to declare his love for Brooklyn. He poured out his feelings on the school forum and sent her a joke through text every morning and evening. He even gifted her luxury items in addition to handwritten love letters. 

Christopher hated cameras, but he took part in her favorite web show for her sake. He despised social media, but he registered an account just for Brooklyn. He followed her social media accounts and stayed up late to leave comments on every single one of her posts. 

The entire college knew about Christopher's romantic pursuit of her. 

Even the professors would tease Brooklyn when they met her, "Haven't you agreed to get together yet?"

How could someone like Christopher be involved with Samantha? When did this relationship even start?

Suddenly, Brooklyn remembered a diary she once found while cleaning the walk-in closet. She had quietly put it back out of respect for Christopher's privacy.

But now, she slammed on the gas pedal decisively and sped home. She found the diary and opened it. 

"March 2. Samantha kissed me, and I couldn't stop myself from responding. But we're siblings. What would the world think of us?"

"March 5. I don't have the courage. This has to stop. Brooklyn is beautiful and capable enough. If I pursue her seriously, maybe Samantha will believe I've fallen in love with someone else."

"March 6. A grand public confession of love… Samantha might finally give up now that the news had spread far and wide, right?"

The entire diary was about Samantha… Even after Samantha had gone abroad, and even when Christopher was already dating Brooklyn!

The entries continued up to the day of his proposal. 

"Since I can't be with Samantha, it's all the same whoever I marry. I'll just settle for Brooklyn. I'm too tired to search for another woman."

Brooklyn read the words in his diary obsessively, torturing herself with every line. Her body trembled uncontrollably. 

May 6th was the day her mother had passed away. 

That day, Christopher had taken a bullet train and a bus to find her. His eyes were red when they finally met. She thought he came because he cared about her. That was why she finally agreed to date him!

Brooklyn had always been outstanding in all aspects since she was young, and she had many admirers. Yet to Christopher, she was merely someone to settle down with!

Brooklyn covered her face and allowed her tears to flow freely, wetting her palms. 

"Christopher, this is the last time I'll cry over you," she thought. 

After calming herself down, Brooklyn made a call to her lawyer friend, Natasha Hudson. She said, "Help me draft a divorce agreement. Christopher's the one at fault, and I want the highest level of financial compensation possible." 

That night, Brooklyn picked up her son and returned home. Coincidentally, Christopher was moving Samantha's luggage back into the house at the same time. 

Brooklyn didn't spare them a second glance. She simply told Robert to have dinner at the table. 

"Chris, Robbie is safely discharged from the hospital, and I'm back home now. All's well that ends well. Why don't we have a drink to celebrate?" Samantha brought out a bottle of whiskey and poured drinks for everyone. 

The strong smell of liquor made Robert press his throbbing forehead. "Dad, this alcohol smells terrible. I feel dizzy and nauseous."

Christopher noticed Samantha's dejected expression. "If you can't handle the smell, go and sit somewhere else." He turned to Brooklyn and said, "How did you raise our son to have no manners at all?"

Brooklyn led Robert back to his room in silence. 

Behind their backs, Christopher spoke to Samantha in a gentle tone, "Don't mind them. I'll celebrate with you. Just the two of us."

Robert looked up at Brooklyn with tears in his eyes while eating dinner in the room. "Mom, is it okay to not have a dad? Since he doesn't like me, I won't like him either."

Brooklyn's heart ached with sorrow. She hugged her son tightly, her eyes reddened as well. 

Later, Christopher came back to the room after having a few drinks. There was a lipstick stain on his white shirt. The sight of it made Brooklyn feel sick. 

"Brooklyn, I have a gift for you and Robert."

Christopher took two documents out of his briefcase, showing that he had transferred the ownership of two properties to her and Robert. 

He said, "Samantha didn't do it on purpose. Consider this my apology on her behalf. As her sister-in-law, shouldn't you be more generous? Don't be so calculative with her."

Christopher gave Brooklyn an expectant look, as if she should feel grateful for his generosity despite abandoning Robert repeatedly. 

Brooklyn placed the divorce agreement in front of him and pointed at the signature line. She said expressionlessly, "Sign here."

Christopher picked up a pen and signed his name on the line. His handwriting was exactly the same in the love letters he had given her back then. 

"What project is this about?" he asked indifferently. 

Brooklyn curled her lips into a mocking smile. "One that will make both of us very happy."

Brooklyn decided to move out with Robert during the cooling-off period of one month. 

Staying one day more in this home that she had personally designed and decorated made her feel sick to her stomach. 

That morning, Brooklyn was organizing her clothes in the walk-in closet. Christopher came in and stood beside her out of habit. He was waiting for her to hand him his matching coat and tie. 

Christopher remarked. "Brooklyn, take Robert and stay somewhere else for a few days. He's been crying all night for the past two days, and Samantha is a light sleeper. 

"She's on the verge of a breakdown due to the noise disturbance. Once she recovers, I'll bring you and Robert home immediately."

Brooklyn's hand slipped, and she accidentally tore a long slit in her silk dress. 

Great, it was just what she wanted. 

Brooklyn had been thinking about how to tell Christopher that they were moving out. Now, she didn't even need to find an excuse. She mustered up all her strength and forced a single word from her throat. "Okay."

Christopher waited for another moment, but Brooklyn didn't hand him his coat. He went up to her and hugged her gently. "Are you feeling upset? Samantha was delicately raised—"

Brooklyn pushed him away impatiently. "Samantha! Samantha! You talk about her all day long. Anyone who didn't know would think that she's your woman."

Christopher's face darkened. "What nonsense are you talking about? You're a graduate from a reputable college. How could your mind be so depraved?"

He turned around and slammed the door on his way out, but he retraced his steps a moment later. He warned her, saying, "Don't let me hear any rumors circulating outside."

That day, Brooklyn called a moving company and had everything taken to the house she owned before getting married to Christopher. 

Brooklyn thought she wouldn't have to see Samantha's face any longer. Unexpectedly, Samantha showed up at her office.

"Brooklyn, I feel really bad that you and Robert can't stay home because of my health. That's why I thought of coming over to lend you a hand. Assign me a position at your company. I've already gotten Chris' approval."

"There's no need," Brooklyn said. 

Samantha snapped, "I'm a graduate from Stanport College. Do you know how many companies are fighting over me? I came here because we're family, but how dare you put on airs? Don't be so ungrateful and shameless!"

Brooklyn had the security escort her out immediately. 

Half an hour later, Christopher canceled a billion-dollar project and rushed over to Brooklyn's office. His face was icy as he asked, "Why are you still making things difficult for Samantha? You're older than her. Can't you be more tolerant of her?"

Did Christopher forget that she was only a year older than Samantha?

Brooklyn didn't want to argue, so she said calmly, "I'm not short on staff. Let her find work elsewhere."

"Brooklyn, you're still so narrow-minded. I'm truly disappointed in you." Christopher took Samantha with him and left.

However, the senior executives and junior staff of her company suddenly resigned en masse a few days later. Brooklyn's company came to a screeching halt. 

She tried to recruit workers in person but couldn't hire anyone. Feeling frustrated and anxious, she had no choice but to sell her company at a low price. 

On the day of handover to the new boss, Brooklyn pushed open the door to her office only to find Samantha sitting in her chair. 

Samantha said, "Chris said it's boring to just be an employee. If I'm going to join, I might as well be the boss. 

"Brooklyn, don't you think he's being just too domineering? Chris paid your employees twice their annual salaries to make them quit their jobs. That cost tens of millions."

Brooklyn clenched her fists. She had started the company back in college and moved her office from a rented room in a residential neighborhood to the most luxurious office building. She endured countless hardships, sweat, and tears. 

This company was her lifeblood, and she cared for it like her own child. 

Christopher had witnessed how hard she worked to build up her company, yet he made her sell it off as if it were child's play. Furthermore, he sold it to the very woman who almost killed their son. 

Brooklyn regretted deeply. She regretted ever mistaking his persistence for sincerity. She hurt Robert, lost her company, and ruined herself. 

Christopher came into the room and sighed. "Things didn't have to turn out so ugly… We're family, so it doesn't make much of a difference. Brooklyn, this is still your company."

Brooklyn sneered coldly.

"Family? Christopher, we won't be very soon," she thought. 

She handed the handover documents to Samantha. "You've won. I don't want the company anymore."

As soon as Brooklyn spoke, Samantha started throwing all the trophies and awards displayed in the cabinet onto the floor with a loud clatter. Some shards flew toward Brooklyn and cut her foot. Blood flowed out immediately. 

Just as Samantha picked up the last trophy made out of colorful ceramic, Brooklyn rushed over and snatched it from her hands. "Stop!"

Samantha furrowed her brows and said, "You're the one who said you don't want the company. Why are you yelling at me when I'm just redecorating my office? What's more, you scratched my finger!"

Christopher strode forward and gently lifted her hand to inspect it. She had a tiny scrape on the tip of her index finger. 

He turned to Brooklyn and shouted, "Where's the first aid kit?" She pointed toward it and turned to leave. 

"Stop right there." Christopher spoke again in an unusually calm voice. "Give the trophy to Samantha. This office belongs to her now, and she has full authority to do whatever she wants with it."

His tone softened a little as he continued, "If you want, Robert and I will make you a new one."

Brooklyn scrutinized Christopher. So, he still remembered that this trophy had been a gift from him and their son. It was because of their love that she had treasured this trophy so deeply. However, how much of his love was ever real?

Since she didn't even want Christopher now, there was no reason for her to hold onto the trophy anymore.

Brooklyn saw everything clearly in that instant. She raised the trophy high above her head and smashed it onto the floor. 

The ceramic shards flew onto Christopher's pant legs and shoes, leaving a white scratch on the leather. 

He suddenly felt an eerie sense of weightlessness. The feeling spread from his chest to his entire body, as if the scratch was carved on his heart and not on his shoes. 

Christopher was speechless for a moment.

Suddenly, he caught sight of blood on the floor. It came from the wound on Brooklyn's foot. He stepped forward and reached out to hold her arm instinctively. "Brooklyn, you're hurt."

At that moment, Samantha let out a pitiful sob. 

Pursing his lips, Christopher released Brooklyn's arm and instructed her quickly, "Take a seat for now. I'll bandage Samantha first before tending to your wound."

Brooklyn gave him a wry smile and strode out of the office without sparing him another glance. 

That evening, Brooklyn picked up her phone and saw Samantha's Facebook post. It was a photo of blue skies, the vast ocean, and a giant cruise ship. 

Beaming widely, her employees held up a red banner that said, "Thank you, Ms. Zeller, for the company trip!"

Christopher had his arms around Samantha as they stood at the bow. Both of them were smiling happily in the photo. 

Since Samantha had just become the new boss, she took her employees on a company trip for team building. Meanwhile, Christopher went along to help her build authority and win their hearts. 

Brooklyn was reminded of those years she had fought alone to build her company. Christopher kept her company as they stayed up through the night to revise project materials and brainstorm ways to improve customer traffic…

But it was always Brooklyn who reached out to Christopher. He never took the initiative to think of her needs. 

Christopher also never accompanied her to any company events, not even when she begged him to. He didn't like socializing, so Brooklyn didn't push him. 

At that moment, she thought he was already doing enough. But after seeing how he treated her in comparison to Samantha, the disparity in love and effort became painfully clear. 

For an entire week, Samantha kept updating her Facebook with travel photos. She even sent a few directly to Brooklyn. There was a bouquet of red roses and a pair of matching couple bracelets on their wrists, side by side. 

Samantha's text read, "Brooklyn, this restaurant for couples has great food! We even won these beautiful matching bracelets from the kissing challenge. You and Chris should come and try it sometime!"

Brooklyn tightened her grip around the phone and suppressed the suffocating pain she felt in her chest. Her finger was trembling uncontrollably. She had to try a few times before she finally managed to capture a screenshot and save it as evidence.

Samantha came looking for Brooklyn the day she and Christopher returned from the company trip. She spoke in a pitiful tone. "Brooklyn, I've only been away for a week, but all our business partners cut ties with us suddenly. They are even spreading rumors that I'm having an affair with Chris. 

"This is also your company. Even if you hate me, you shouldn't ruin the company. If you're really upset with me, I'll hand the company back to you."

Brooklyn didn't want to argue, even though she had been falsely accused without reason. She enunciated each word coldly, "The company belongs to you. Don't come to me now that things have gone wrong."

Samantha dropped to her knees and cried, "Brooklyn, I'll keep kneeling here if you're still mad at me. But you shouldn't jeopardize Chris' company from going public, even if you're angry at me."

Brooklyn didn't have a chance to respond when she was suddenly shoved aside with force. She accidentally hit her head on the doorframe, and a streak of bright red blood trickled down her cheek. 

She saw Christopher rushing over to help Samantha up from the floor, his expression full of worry and concern. "Samantha had knee surgery before, so she can't kneel on the ground or be exposed to drafts. Why are you making things so difficult for her? Can't you be more tolerant?"

Hot tears welled up in Brooklyn's eyes immediately. It felt as if the festering wound in her heart was torn open and bleeding profusely after getting stabbed by a knife. 

He remembered Samantha's weak knees, but what about her company? What about Robert? Christopher remembered none of it. 

Brooklyn snapped angrily, "If you think I'm making things difficult for her, come back with evidence before you accuse me." She slammed the door shut. 

The next day, Brooklyn went to the kindergarten to pick up Robert. She saw a few shady-looking young men carrying Robert away by force. 

Brooklyn rushed up to stop them and save her son. However, she nearly lost consciousness after getting beaten to the ground by the group. With the last ounce of her strength, she managed to call the police and tried to call Christopher. 

Once, twice, and thrice…

The call went through on her 20th try. Unexpectedly, Samantha's lazy voice came from the other end of the call. "Chris is in the shower."

Brooklyn was so furious that she finally lost consciousness and fainted. She found herself in a hospital ward when she opened her eyes once again. 

Christopher's anxious face appeared in front of her. 

"About our son—"

Christopher cut her off and spoke urgently. "The ones who picked Robert up were Samantha's friends. I gave them permission to do so. They only fought back because they didn't recognize you and thought you were trying to kidnap him. 

"You need to hurry up and explain things clearly to the police. Samantha was also taken in for questioning. She has had trauma from police stations, and it will be hard on her to stay there…"

As Christopher spoke, he helped Brooklyn sit up. He only realized that she was in pain and slowed down his movements when she let out a soft hiss. 

Brooklyn smiled bitterly. She thought that he was worried about her health, but it turned out that he was merely concerned about Samantha's suffering. 

"I want to see Robert," Brooklyn said. 

"I'll bring him to you immediately once you withdraw your police report."

Brooklyn let out a laugh. It turned out that she could still laugh even though she was utterly heartbroken from disappointment. 

She asked, "Aren't you going to ask how many bones I've broken, how much does it hurt, or even whether I'm thirsty?"

Christopher brought a cup of water to her lips and coaxed gently, "I've called in the best specialists for you. You'll be fine."

Brooklyn chuckled drily and gave her statement to the police. 

Ten minutes later, Samantha entered the room with Robert in tow. The boy looked listless as he walked in. Tears rolled down his cheeks when he saw Brooklyn lying in the hospital bed, looking as pale as a sheet. 

He cried, "They put headphones on me so I couldn't hear your voice. I'm sorry, Mom. Are you hurting a lot? Let me blow on your wounds for you."

Brooklyn's tears finally spilled from her eyes. Even a child could see that she was hurting, but Christopher hadn't cared to ask once. 

Brooklyn caught sight of Samantha approaching them at that moment. She instinctively pulled Robert closer to her side, putting some distance between them. 

Samantha gave her a half-smile and glanced at Christopher, who was outside taking a call. She leaned closer to Brooklyn and whispered, "I gave Robert a little gift. Why don't you guess what it is?"

Brooklyn grabbed Samantha suddenly. "What did you do?"

"Ouch! Brooklyn, you're hurting me!" Samantha put on a pitiful face immediately. 

Hearing the commotion, Christopher rushed into the ward and pried Brooklyn's fingers off Samantha. His voice was filled with suppressed anger. "Brooklyn, aren't you ever going to stop?"

Brooklyn's nails left several red marks on Samantha's forearm, which made Christopher frown. He took Samantha's hand and asked, "Are you in pain? Let's get it disinfected."

Meanwhile, Brooklyn shouted in a panic, "Christopher! Take Robert for a full body checkup first! He doesn't look too good!"

Nonetheless, Christopher didn't even spare them a glance. 

Brooklyn was on the verge of losing her mind when she saw Robert's deathly pale face. She took deep breaths to force herself to stay calm. 

While pressing the call button frantically, she asked Robert gently, "Robert, did they do anything to you?"

Robert's body swayed before suddenly collapsing to the floor, whispering, "I just ate a little snack… Mom, I'm fine." 

He scrambled to get up, but he couldn't muster the strength, no matter how hard he tried. 

Brooklyn got off the bed and tried to help. However, she couldn't even carry him due to her broken arm. At that moment, she despised Christopher with all her heart. 

Doctors rushed in and took Robert to have his stomach pumped. They found blood pressure pills in his stomach and immediately admitted him as an emergency case. 

Brooklyn could only watch as multiple tubes of blood were drawn from her son's small body while getting infused with numerous bags of fluid. She wished she could suffer in his place. 

At that moment, Christopher arrived in a hurry. He was stunned when he saw his son in critical condition. A rare trace of pain showed in his eyes. "What happened?"

Brooklyn gritted her teeth and shouted, "Something bad happens to Robert every single time he goes out with Samantha! Are you really going to keep pretending ignorance and tolerate her?"

Christopher furrowed his brows. "You're being paranoid again. Robert's my son. Would Samantha hurt him? She cares so much about him."

However, he couldn't bring himself to say anything harsher once he saw the disappointed look on Brooklyn's face. Christopher pulled her into a comforting hug. "Alright. I won't let Robert be around her anymore."

Then, he turned to admonish Robert. "Don't just eat anything strangers give you. Understand?"

Brooklyn pushed him away. She no longer held any expectations for Christopher. 

That night, she called Natasha while Christopher was away and got in touch with a trustworthy private investigator. 

Brooklyn instructed, "I want you to help me investigate two things. First, how did my son ingest blood pressure pills? 

"Secondly, I want a full report on Samantha's life abroad. I want every detail on everything she did. Dig up everything about her!"

The reason Samantha dared to be so arrogant was that she was confident of Christopher's support. Now, she would strip Samantha of that confidence completely. 

Over the next few days, Christopher did not go to the office. Perhaps out of guilt, he stayed at the hospital to care for Brooklyn and Robert. He made sure they were fed and stayed up late reading bedtime stories.

If Robert cried, Christopher would hold and comfort him for an hour without complaint. 

Seeing that Brooklyn's emotions remained downcast, Christopher kept pushing back his work schedule to spend time with them. He showered Brooklyn with all the jewelry and accessories that she used to like as if they grew on trees, but she didn't even crack a smile. 

It wasn't until the board director called Christopher personally to urge him to stick to his work schedule that he finally left the hospital. Before he left, he spent a good ten minutes giving the housekeeper detailed instructions on how to care for them. 

The hospital staff remarked enviously, "I've never seen such a considerate husband."

Brooklyn merely gave a faint smile. All his attention and care reminded her of their past when they were still a loving and inseparable family. 

However, she knew the truth deep down. As soon as Samantha was involved, Christopher would lose all reason and shatter that illusion of happiness with his own hands. It would happen over and over again, without any end in sight. 

Like right now…

Samantha turned up again and said that she felt guilty for causing trouble despite her good intentions. She wanted to stay and take care of Brooklyn and Robert. 

Christopher immediately forgot about the promise he made to Brooklyn earlier. "Brooklyn, just let Samantha stay and take care of you two. Otherwise, she won't be able to sleep from guilt."

After saying that, he left to go on a business trip. 

Brooklyn texted Natasha to take Robert away and look after him for a few days. Only after sending him away did she finally breathe a sigh of relief. 

That night, the pain from her wounds kept her from sleeping. Brooklyn instinctively reached for her painkillers, but she couldn't find them. Beads of cold sweat rolled down her face. 

Just as she was about to call for a doctor, Samantha pushed her back onto the bed forcefully. 

"I threw out your painkillers. It's bad for your body to take too much of that stuff and will lead to drug dependence. Just deal with it if you're in pain."

When the housekeeper came to deliver Brooklyn's meal, Samantha frowned and ordered it to be replaced with gruel. "Patients should eat a light diet."

Brooklyn retorted. "Don't listen to her. Bring it over to me."

However, Samantha crossed her arms and spoke to the housekeeper. "You should think carefully. Who do you think Christopher will listen to?"

After a moment of hesitation, the housekeeper quietly turned and left. 

Although Brooklyn already knew the answer to that question long ago, she still felt a deep sense of shame when the housekeeper chose to walk away. Even an outsider could see his favoritism clearly, despite being unaware of the full truth. 

Christopher owed her too much!

Samantha turned back to give Brooklyn a provocative smile. "When are you going to divorce Chris and leave the house? Chris belongs to me alone. I was already his woman once I graduated from high school."

"What if I don't leave?"

"Then get ready to bury your son's body. If I fail to poison him this time, there will always be a second or third time."

Brooklyn let out a scornful laugh. "Christopher already slept with you back then, but still didn't marry you. Why is that? Is it free for the taking because you're his stepsister?"

Samantha rushed forward and raised her hand to strike Brooklyn. However, a bodyguard suddenly grabbed her arm from behind and restrained her. 

Samantha tried the same intimidation tactic she used on the housekeeper earlier, but Brooklyn said coldly, "This is the bodyguard team I just hired. They're not Christopher's men. Throw her out this instant!"

There was finally silence in the hospital ward. Brooklyn took out her phone, which had been on record the whole time. She tapped pause on the recording and saved the file. 

On the day of Brooklyn's discharge, Christopher had just returned from his business trip. He came to pick her up from the hospital. 

"Samantha thought you were upset about her making you eat plain gruel. So she has been eating nothing but gruel herself for a whole week up until now…" 

His tone was full of sympathy. "Samantha meant well. She just doesn't know much about nutrition and diet. She wants to make peace with you, so she threw a party to celebrate your discharge today. Try to be more gracious with her."

Brooklyn was about to decline the invitation when she heard him add, "I've already arranged for someone to pick up Robert."

He managed to get her where it hurt the most. Brooklyn's chest tightened painfully. 

Christopher leaned in to kiss her, but she turned her head away. He stuffed two gift boxes into her hands. "One for you, and the other for Samantha. She loves accessories such as earrings and necklaces. She'll be thrilled if you give this to her."

However, Brooklyn merely looked out the window. She didn't say a single word to him the entire journey. 

Samantha ran up to them as soon as they got out of the car and clung to Christopher eagerly, her chest practically pr
