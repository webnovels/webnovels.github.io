After my wife Olivia tortured me for the 98th time because of Liam, I was completely heartbroken and accepted the pursuit of her best friend, Scarlett.
After a night of passion with Scarlett, she promised to help me fake my death and marry her abroad with a brand new identity.
After taking the fake death pill Scarlett gave me, I woke up prematurely in the coffin.
I couldn't move my body at all, but I could hear Scarlett talking to someone outside the coffin.
"Ms. Shen, you've made Olivia torture Lucas and then pretended to save him. You've completely gained his trust. Why do you still need to arrange for him to fake his death and be buried?"
"Only by doing this will the Wilson family believe he's dead. Then Liam's position as the heir will be secure, and no one will ever mention that he's an illegitimate child again."
The other person hesitantly asked, "Won't it be too long to dig him out after seven days when you and Liam hold your wedding?"
"The fake death pill's effect can last for five days. I've already had people put water, food, and an oxygen tank in the coffin. He won't die."
