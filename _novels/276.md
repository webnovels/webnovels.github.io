“Ladies and gentlemen, tonight’s main event is about to begin!”

“Any gentleman here who can guess Miss Chloe’s measurements can take her home for the night! There’s no limit to how many can guess correctly!”

Serena turned to look at me, a smirk playing on her lips.

Before the words even faded, men, like hungry wolves, roared and lunged at me. Dozens of hands clawed and groped at my body, mercilessly tearing at my dress. I frantically clutched at my chest, trying to shield myself.

“Damian, please, don’t let them do this!”

I cried out, looking at Damian, but he stood by Serena’s side, completely unconcerned, not even flinching.
