Phoebe took out a thermos from her handbag and suddenly grabbed Willa's wrist away from everyone's sight. "Good girl," she said, covering the child's eyes, "Mommy's going to do a magic trick."

"No!"

I rushed forward to stop her, but she shoved me away. 

The next second, a piercing cry echoed through the hall. Willa's fair arm instantly became red and blistered, and Phoebe quickly shoved the thermos into my hand.

"Help!"

Phoebe fell to her knees, holding the heartbrokenly crying Willa tightly, "Sister, if you have any grievances, come at me. 

Why scald Willa with boiling water? She's just a child!"

I was completely stunned, not expecting her to be so devious as to frame me and even harm her own child!

Gideon rushed over, saw Willa's injuries, and without thinking, kicked me to the ground, shouting angrily, "How could you harm such a young child! Are you even human?"

Gideon called the family doctor to treat Willa's wounds. 

Suddenly, Ezra started crying loudly. I lay on the ground, struggling to get up, trembling as I reached for Ezra, "Ezra, baby, don't be afraid... tell Daddy... who just..."

Before I could finish, Ezra hid behind Gideon in terror, crying, "It was Mommy! She poured hot water on Sister! I'm scared!"

I froze instantly, my outstretched hand dropping weakly.

"Are you really this jealous just because I brought Lydia to a party once? They're the kids you raised yourself!"

I opened my mouth, the taste of blood growing stronger in my throat, finally turning into a barely audible laugh. I looked into Gideon's furious eyes, "Gideon, do you really believe this?"

"He's only six. Can he lie?"

The guests around started whispering. Some called me "vicious," others said, "No wonder you can't have kids, with such a cruel heart." 

The crowd's accusations drowned me, but what hurt more was Gideon's hateful gaze piercing my heart. To him, I was nothing but a jealous and vicious woman.

Phoebe leaned into Gideon's arms, eyes red, "Sister, if you're sick, you need treatment. How could you do something so cruel?"

Ezra's cries grew louder, saying he was scared just seeing me. Gideon pointed at me and shouted, "Nora, get out of here where we can't see you!"

I wiped the blood from my mouth, stood up shakily, and took the divorce agreement I always carried out of my bag, smiling bitterly, "It's time to leave... sign it, and I'll leave quietly."

Gideon's anger grew, and he stood up, tearing the divorce agreement and throwing it in my face, "Without ten billion, don't even think about leaving! You'll be my wife for life, Nora!"

Outside, the rain poured down as I staggered into it, the cold rain mixing with my tears. Ten years of marriage, sincerity, and patience—shouldn't it end when I get the money tomorrow?

The next second, everything went black, and I fell down the stairs. Just as I thought I would hit the ground, I was suddenly caught in a warm, strong embrace.

"I was only late for a moment, and you made yourself this miserable, hmm?"

When I woke up again, I was in a hospital. The man in front of me was handsome, the current head of Carter Group, Declan Carter. 

I was about to speak when I noticed a familiar diamond cufflink on his suit sleeve, the gift I gave to a life-saver on my eighteenth birthday.

"You finally recognize me? I didn't waste years loving you."

Declan leaned in, his voice deep and magnetic. 

Memories surged back: when I was eighteen, I was kidnapped, and a young man risked his life to save me. Before leaving, I gave him my most precious birthday gift...

"It's you..."

My voice trembled as I instinctively tried to sit up, but he suddenly looked tense and supported me, "Careful, the doctor said you're pregnant, eight weeks."

I froze completely. The timing was just right; it was Gideon's last time with me when he was drunk and mistook me for Phoebe.

Declan chuckled coldly, "Interesting, Gideon kicked you out, not knowing his wife is pregnant with his child."

He smirked and looked at me with intense eyes, "But soon it won't be his."

I was overwhelmed by the barrage of news, "What?"

Declan laughed, "The ten billion has already been transferred; whether he signs or not, he has to."
