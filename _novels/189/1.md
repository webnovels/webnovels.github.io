deon's beloved Lydia had given birth to his third child. 

On our tenth wedding anniversary, he brought yet another child conceived outside our marriage and said calmly:

“Lydia's child is the future heir of Gideon's family. As Mrs. Gideon, it's your duty to teach them well.”

I didn't react with tears or anger as I had before—I simply took the baby calmly. The guests erupted into laughter.

“I heard she made quite a fuss the last two times, but this time she's learned her lesson.”

“With the Quentin family bankrupt, she knows a scene won’t help. Without her own child, she’ll be out sooner or later.”

Gideon ignored their mockery and insults. I swallowed my bitterness and managed a smile:

“Gideon, let’s get a divorce.”

Gideon laughed, as though he’d heard the most ridiculous joke:

“Nora, if you can come up with a billion dollars right now, I'll sign immediately. Otherwise, stop pretending!”

Without replying, I dialed an unfamiliar number:

“I accept your terms.”

A cultured voice responded with a gentle laugh:

“A mere billion dollars. I can pay it for you anytime.”
