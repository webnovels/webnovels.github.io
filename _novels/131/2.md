Dad arranged for me to live in the attic.

Although it only had a small window, I could see the beautiful flowers in the yard.

Except for mealtime, I could only stay in the small attic.

If I behaved and polished my brothers' shoes, they occasionally took me out.

Though tiring, it was much better than the orphanage.

Today, they were in a good mood and willing to take me to the mall.

Declan's voice was harsh, "Adeline, if you dare touch anything, don't expect dinner tonight."

Seeing me silent, he grabbed my ear again, "Deaf? Answer me!"

I shivered, lowered my head, and whispered, "Got it, Declan."

He snorted coldly, "Don't call me Declan, you're just an outsider."

I sat quietly in the corner, nodding obediently, but I was starving.

The smell of roasted chestnuts and meat pies made my mouth water. My stomach growled.

Suddenly, I heard a "ding."

It was a piano.

Before Mom passed, she taught me how to play the piano.

A cleaning lady was wiping the piano bench, and I was drawn over as if by magic.

I wanted to touch it, just once.

I couldn't help but play the tune Mom often played for me.

I forgot what it was called.

I felt like crying, unsure if the melody was too moving or if I just missed Mom.

"Stupid girl!"

Someone suddenly grabbed my ear, and Declan dragged me off the piano bench. "Didn't I tell you not to wander? You dare touch things!"

Many people around were discussing something.

I couldn't hear clearly.

Declan yanked my hair and shoved me into the car.

It hurt, but I didn't dare cry. If I cried, there'd be no food.

I was locked in the attic.

The smell of food wafted from the kitchen, making me so hungry I wanted to cry.

A servant secretly tossed me a bun, and I gobbled it up.

I suddenly missed Mom a lot. Why did she have to leave me so soon?
