The temperature dropped at night, and I had no thick clothes, so I curled up under a thin blanket.

The next morning, my throat ached.

Cold wind blew in through the window, and I wrapped myself tighter.

I felt dizzy and didn't leave my room all day.

Half-awake, I heard someone angrily calling me.

Declan kicked open my door with a "bang."

He stormed to my bed with a broken guitar. "Adeline, are you trying to get yourself killed?"

I hurriedly propped myself up, not knowing why he was so angry.

"Declan, what's wrong?"

"Still playing dumb?" He grabbed my collar and dragged me off the bed. My knee hit the floor hard. "The guitar has bread crumbs on it. Everyone knows you love bread."

"Yesterday when I played the guitar, I saw you hovering around. Don't think I didn't notice!"

"How could it be such a coincidence?" He grabbed my trembling hand. "The evidence is clear, what are you pretending for?"

I shook my head desperately, my voice hoarse. "It wasn't me, I didn't leave my room all day, I really didn't touch the guitar..."

"Yesterday, I watched you play the guitar, just admiring, not lurking."

Finn leaned against the doorframe, sneering, "Hands and feet raised in the slums are dirty. Not enough to steal, now you learn to destroy?"

"Declan, isn't your guitar limited edition? Make her pay, after all, Dad gave her the platinum card."

I argued loudly, "I didn't steal anything, and I didn't break the guitar. You're framing Adeline!"

Jasper's footsteps echoed down the hallway.

"Yesterday, I watched Finn play the guitar. I felt admiration, not sneaking around."

Declan leaned against the doorframe with a sneer, "People raised in poverty have sticky fingers. Stealing isn't enough, now you're learning to destroy things too?"

"Finn, isn't your guitar a limited edition? Make her pay for it. Anyway, Dad's platinum card is with her."

I defended myself loudly, "I didn't steal anything, and I didn't break the guitar. You're falsely accusing Adeline!"

Jasper's footsteps echoed from the hallway.

I looked up, hoping for salvation, but his eyes were cold. "If something's broken, there must be consequences. Declan, how do you suggest we handle this?"

"Jasper, I really didn't..." I reached out to tug his sleeve, but he stepped aside.

Finn smirked maliciously, "Go kneel outside. You're not allowed to get up until dinner."

I couldn't hold back my tears any longer.

I still hadn't fulfilled what Mom asked of me.

I wanted to be strong, but I couldn't.

Finn dragged me out by the arm, his nails nearly cutting into my skin, "Stop whining! You think crying will get you out of this?"

I stumbled as he threw me onto the cobblestone path in front of the villa, sharp stones digging into my palms.

Declan stood on the steps with his arms crossed, nudging my leg with his shoe, "Kneel properly. A child like you should follow the rules meant for you."

I bit my lip hard.

The sky was gloomy, like it was about to rain.

Finn cursed irritably, "Damn it, you should just kneel until you drop!"

"Pretending to faint won't work either," Declan's voice suddenly came from above me.

He crouched down, his tone mocking, "It hurts, doesn't it? Say 'I'm just a worthless child,' and I'll plead for you."

My throat burned, but it was nothing compared to the ache in my heart, "I didn't break the guitar..."

"Ingrate!" He grabbed the back of my neck and pressed me into the ground, "Then kneel until you understand your place!"
