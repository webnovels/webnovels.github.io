The day the TV show aired, I sat nervously in front of the TV, palms sweating.

I didn't have many scenes, only a few.

Nora messaged me non-stop, "Adeline! Check Twitter! You're trending!"

Could you please share the specific text you would like me to address?

#Nation's Sweetheart Adeline# followed by a flame icon.

Opening the real-time discussion, the screen was almost completely covered with live comments.

[I need all the info on my baby girl in three minutes!]

[Those crying scenes were phenomenal! Our darling daughter's acting outshines the popular starlets!]

[I found out! She's the adopted daughter of the Bennett Corporation, and she's won international awards for piano!]
