Back in my room, I bandaged my hand, listening to Zachary's voice in the hallway.

"Our Lily is the best, isn't she? Just put on some medicine and you'll be all better. Be good, okay?"

"I promise, tomorrow I'll bring you everything you like."

In seven years of marriage, Zachary had never been so deferential.

In the past when I was hurt or had cramps, he either ignored me or accused me of overreacting.

My heart felt like it was being repeatedly squeezed, aching to the core.

A phone call interrupted my thoughts. I glanced at the caller ID.

As soon as Sophia heard my voice, she nearly cried with relief.

"Aria, why did you take so long to answer? Don't you know how worried I was?"

I glossed over recent events, making an excuse that I was going to Paris to see her in three days.

Sophia seemed to suddenly realize something, about to ask if I was being mistreated.

The next second, Zachary barged in with a bottle of medicine.

I quickly hung up.

He tossed the items on the bed, his tone hostile:

"I brought you medicine. Bandage yourself up quickly and go clean. Don't hurt Lily."

I didn't take it, just staring blankly at the bottle.

Clearly Zachary had just opened it to apply medicine on Lily.

But he forgot I'm allergic to erythromycin.

Last time he carelessly applied it on me without checking, causing an allergic reaction that put me in the hospital.

That night Zachary never came home.

It was a neighbor who noticed something was wrong and called for help.

The next day I saw on Lily's social media that she and Zachary were embracing and passionately kissing amidst cheers from a crowd.

"What are you doing? Does it hurt that much? Let me..."

I deftly avoided his outstretched hand.

He awkwardly froze mid-air, his low voice tinged with displeasure.

"Aria Montgomery, you've had your tantrum. I'm giving you a way out, so don't be stubborn."

"You're a grown woman but can't control your temper. Who are you trying to impress with that sour face?"

But I wasn't throwing a tantrum or losing my temper.

"I heard you say three days earlier..." he began.

I cut him off: "Sophia said she's coming to see me in three days. It won't interfere with you accompanying Lily."

Noticing my aloofness, a complex emotion flashed in Zachary's eyes.

I ignored him, suddenly remembering Alex left at the hospital.

But I stood up too quickly, aggravating my wound.

I couldn't help but hiss in pain.

Zachary pushed me back onto the bed, finally showing a hint of reluctance.

"I've already arranged for someone to look after Alex. He can be discharged in a few days."

In the past, I would have just taken this as something he should do.

But now it's different.

"Thank you," I said softly.

Zachary froze for a moment when he heard those two words, his expression a bit unnatural.

"It's fine, you can go now. Lily will be looking for you soon."

As he finished speaking, Lily appeared in the doorway wearing an ill-fitting dress.

It was the custom-made dress Zachary had specially ordered for me when we got married.

Afraid of dirtying it, I never wore it again after the wedding.

Zachary's face stiffened, his tone turning reproachful.

"This was custom-made for Aria. Why are you wearing it?"

Lily looked utterly dejected, reaching back to grab the zipper.

But she couldn't reach it.

Her face instantly flushed red, tears welling up in her eyes.

"Zach, don't you remember? This is what you brought when you came to see me last time. You even said once I wore it, I'd be the lady of the Shaw family."

Ignoring my presence, Zachary wiped away her tears and kissed her forehead.

"I'm sorry Lily, it's my fault. If you like it, I'll have a hundred made for you."

Seeing Lily beam with joy, Zachary pulled her close and showered her with kisses.

Then he took her back to the bedroom.

The vows of the past were still fresh in my mind.

But today I realized one person's heart could be divided between two.
