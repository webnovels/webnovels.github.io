Before my hand had healed, I was rushing back and forth to the hospital.

Seeing the bandage on my hand, Alex gently blew on it to make it feel better.

My heart melted and I could no longer hold back my tears.

Hot tears fell on Alex's face as he looked up and said softly:

"Mommy, please don't leave me, okay?"

My heart skipped a beat as I pulled him into my arms.

"Mommy's not leaving you. It's just that if you stay with me, life will be very difficult from now on..."

"I only want Mommy."

Hearing my son's answer, a weight lifted from my heart.

After a week of staying at the hospital, Alex was finally discharged and allowed to go home.

During this time, I stayed with Alex while also arranging plans with Sophia.

I sent Zachary a message.

Lily's cold was better and no longer needed my care.

A minute after sending it, Zachary called.

"Aria Montgomery, I order you to be here in 30 minutes. Otherwise I won't hesitate to repeat what happened to Alex last time."

Remembering Alex's flushed face, my heart trembled.

"I've already made myself clear, Zachary. You promised to let me leave once Lily recovered."

He scoffed, his tone harsh:

"Who says Lily is better? Until the doctor declares her fully recovered, you're not going anywhere without my permission."

He added "I've already sent security to pick you up" before abruptly hanging up.

I clearly heard Lily's coquettish voice in the background.

In the past, Zachary hated anyone interrupting his phone calls.

When he had conference calls, I was never allowed to enter the room.

Even if I had just showered and was freezing cold.

When he chatted with friends, I wasn't allowed to make a sound.

Even if I was injured and needed his care.

But now because of Lily, he had truly become someone I didn't recognize.

The memories flashed by in an instant.

Alex and I got out of the car to see Zachary directing the servants to busily prepare.

Seeing me, he tossed what he was holding to me.

It was a guest list and menu.

"Tomorrow is Lily's birthday. I promised her a big celebration. Invite everyone on that list."

"Also, Lily says your cooking is good. You'll make all the food tomorrow."

He commanded me like he would a servant.

But after we married, even when my mother-in-law ordered me, Zachary would stand in front to protect me.

Never letting me step foot in the kitchen.

How laughable that he had forgotten his past promises, yet still presumed to have me handle everything alone.

"Zachary, I refuse. This is not my responsibility and you have no right to order me around."

I turned to leave with Alex, but was stopped by security.

"Sorry ma'am, you can't leave without Mr. Shaw's permission."

I calmly looked up at the guards blocking my way.

They were all hired by me back when I worried about Zachary's safety.

I never imagined they would now only listen to him.

"Fine, I'll stay," I paused for a second before stating my condition: "But after Lily's birthday tomorrow, I'm leaving."

Zachary's expression darkened slightly. After a long moment, he spoke:

"I agree. But to prevent you from leaving on your own, I'll look after our son for now."

With that, the guards took Alex away, completely ignoring my protests.

"Aria Montgomery, you'd better not pull any tricks at Lily's birthday."

"Be sensible and handle everything properly. Stop thinking about leaving. If Lily's in a good mood, I might even give you some money to leave."

I said nothing, staring intently in the direction the guards had taken Alex.

Zachary wasn't wrong.

With Alex here, I couldn't leave either.

I just never expected that this meeting today would be our final goodbye.
