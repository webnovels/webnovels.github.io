Late at night, I was scrolling through my phone when I stumbled upon a faceless help video. 

But I recognized her instantly—it was my wife!

"I'm pregnant, but the man I truly love found out and is demanding I get an abortion. He's terrified I'll lose my figure. But my husband already knows about the pregnancy. How can I convince him to let go of this baby?"

The top comment read:

"Easy. Just pretend to accidentally trip and fall. Smear some chicken blood on your thigh to fake a miscarriage, then go to the hospital for the real abortion. Your husband won't suspect a thing. Plus, you can blame him for not caring enough and make him feel guilty!"

The comments section exploded with outrage. Everyone was cursing the poster—calling her vicious for cheating and plotting to kill her own child.

My whole body trembled as I stared at that video.

Just this morning, Jennifer had told me she was pregnant. I'd been over the moon, calling all our relatives to share the news.

But she was planning to kill the baby?!

Right then, a crash echoed from the kitchen.

Jennifer's panicked, pain-filled voice followed:

"Honey, I fell..."

I dropped my phone and sprinted to the kitchen.

Jennifer lay on the floor, face twisted in agony.

She clutched her stomach, trembling all over. Blood was slowly pooling between her legs.

"Honey, quick... call 911. Something's wrong with our baby!"

Watching Jennifer's frantic expression, my heart sank like a stone.

A chill ran down my spine.

If I'd only been suspicious before—unsure whether the video was really her—now I was one hundred percent certain.

That video was hers.

But if she wanted to put on a show, I'd play along.

I told her to stay calm, then dialed 91
