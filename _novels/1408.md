The first year I signed Marcus Thorne, he insisted on handing over all his earnings from acting for me to manage.
He said I was his most trusted agent, and he felt safe with me looking after his money.
But at the after-party celebrating his big award win, Marcus publicly demanded that I hand over the funds I'd managed for him over the past five years for a full audit.
"After taxes, that's at least ten to twenty million a year. After five years, there should be tens of millions left, right?" he said.
"I don't want to always be limited by the company's cut. I'll use my own savings to start my independent studio."
"Part of it will be seed money, and the rest will be my advance on future profits."
I froze, completely stunned. "But the money in the account isn't even close to that amount!"
Marcus's face instantly twisted. "Ashley Clark! You blew through tens of millions?!"
His new girlfriend, Sienna Reed, immediately shrieked beside him, "Where did all that money go? Did you secretly spend it all?"
Marcus started yelling, demanding to see the books. 
I immediately motioned for my assistant, Chloe, to prepare the projection files.
Sienna, however, suddenly panicked, instinctively tugging at Marcus's sleeve.
