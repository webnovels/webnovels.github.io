With only three days passed, I clearly remembered what happened that night. My husband had been with me the whole time, sleeping very soundly. So I naturally told the truth.

My husband and I were questioned separately by the police.

I was interviewed by a man and a woman. The man, Mike, was around 30 and a deputy leader of the major crime unit. The woman, Wendy, looked to be in her late 20s and was quite beautiful.

Perhaps because I was pregnant and had just learned about my husband's affair, they saw my red-rimmed eyes and were very gentle when questioning me, probably worried I couldn't handle the psychological stress.

Especially Wendy - she looked at me with kind eyes and asked, "Mrs. Lin, please think carefully. Are you absolutely certain your husband didn't leave the house that night? Is it possible he snuck out while you were asleep?"

I was taken aback, considered for a moment, then said, "Officer Wendy, since becoming pregnant I've been sleeping a lot, so I go to bed early every night. All I can say is that my husband was there when I fell asleep and when I woke up."

Wendy and Mike exchanged a glance. Curiously, I asked, "Officer Wendy, can't you extract DNA evidence from the rape victim? If you suspect my husband, you could test for that."

Even as I said this, I was thinking - they were already having an affair, why would he need to rape her? The killer definitely wasn't my husband.

Seeing my question, Wendy shook her head and said, "The killer was clever and didn't leave any useful evidence. So this case is a bit complicated to investigate."

I made a sound of acknowledgment. Wendy asked how far along my pregnancy was. I told her just over 4 months. She smiled and glanced at my belly, saying it looked quite large and might be twins. She added that pregnant women are prone to emotional reactions and advised me to try to stay positive and take good care of myself.

I was very touched by Wendy's words. After chatting a bit more, I left the police station.

I thought my husband would be coming home with me, but Officer Mike said he needed to stay and assist with the investigation. With no other choice, I had to go home alone.

Back in my neighborhood, I learned from neighbors that several police officers had come by. They had checked the security camera footage and asked if anyone had heard our door open between 9 PM and early morning on July 30th.

I asked what the neighbor had told them. She said she hadn't heard anything, so she told them the truth. Hearing this, I felt reassured.

I assumed my husband would be spending the night at the police station since he wasn't answering my calls. But just as I was about to go to sleep after dinner, he came home.

He was still cold and aloof as usual. I got up to heat some food for him, but he stopped me. I asked, "Honey, why didn't you answer my call earlier?"

He said the police had taken his phone to copy his chat and call records.

Thinking about all the intimate exchanges with that woman on his phone, I felt disgusted. But considering the baby, I held back. After all, that woman was dead now - what was there left to be upset about?

But I was wrong. My lack of concern didn't mean others felt the same. As I dozed off, I suddenly felt a violent choking sensation. Opening my eyes, I realized my husband was frantically strangling me, trying to kill me.
