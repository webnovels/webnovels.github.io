Eleanor helped Bella up, but I caught a flash of resentment in her eyes. She sighed, looking at me with a weighty tone.

“I already know about Bella’s leukemia. You know our financial situation… maybe we should just… let it go.”

I quickly cut in, “The child calls you Mom, after all! How can we just let it go?”

Liam, who was engrossed in his game, impatiently interjected. “So what if she calls her Mom? She’s not her *real* daughter.”

His utter lack of concern sent a chill down my spine.

After we remarried, I was so worried he wouldn’t adjust that I gave him everything, the very best.

I never imagined he wouldn’t just fail to protect his sister, but would say something so heartless.

I was shaking with rage, standing up and pointing at him, demanding, “Bella is your sister! Just because she’s not biological, she doesn’t deserve to be saved?”

Eleanor, clearly annoyed, pulled me back.

“Enough! Why are you yelling at Liam? Forget the astronomical cost of a bone marrow transplant, even a single round of radiation therapy costs tens of thousands. This is a bottomless pit with no end in sight.”

She glanced at Bella, whose tears were still wet on her cheeks, and spoke coldly.

“Blame Bella for her bad luck, I guess. I know you like having a girl, but if it comes down to it, we can just have another one.”

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I spoke, my voice laced with urgency.

“Leukemia isn’t as terrifying as you think. Early treatment can be covered by insurance. Are you just going to stand there and watch the child…?”

She crossed her arms, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

“Your child is a child, but Liam and I are outsiders? We’re just living together, you know. Don’t be so selfish, okay? If it were Liam who was sick, I would absolutely divorce you and bear the responsibility alone. I would never drag you down.”

“Besides, you’d sell the house and car to treat this money pit, and she’ll just get married off eventually anyway, right? How much can you get back from a dowry?”

She looked at Bella with disdain, letting out a scornful scoff.

“But you can’t just…”

Before I could finish, Liam violently slammed his phone screen onto the couch and roared.

“Ugh! So annoying!”

“I’ve said it a hundred times, she’s not getting treated! You’ve completely messed up my character in the game! If you bother me again while I’m playing, I’ll pull your oxygen tube when you’re old!”

Liam was like a furious little beast, his eyes wide, looking at me as if I were his enemy.

Suddenly, I felt Eleanor had a point. If I risked everything—selling the house and car—to save Liam, and then had to worry about him not taking care of me in old age, would saving him really be worth it?

Lost in thought, Eleanor handed me divorce papers.

“What’s the meaning of this?”

My heart sank. Only an hour or two had passed since the test results came out, and she already had the divorce papers ready!

“Leukemia treatment is astronomically expensive. I don’t want my child to live a life of hardship with you. Sign this, and let’s go to the registry office to get divorced.”

Just one glance sent a shiver down my spine.

She not only demanded that I leave with absolutely nothing, but also that I pay monthly child support for Liam.

I lightly tapped my finger on the table, my eyes fixed on Eleanor.

“Why should I walk away with nothing?”

Eleanor’s expression was one of complete righteousness.

“All these years, I’ve been a stay-at-home mom, taking care of the child. I’ve lost my ability to work. Isn’t it only right that you compensate my son and me?”

I spread my hands. “After the divorce, you won’t have to take care of the child? Won’t you still need to find a job?”

A look of urgency flashed across her face:

“Jobs are so hard to find these days. Until I find one, don’t you think you should give me some financial security? Otherwise, how will a single mother and her child survive?”

“Didn’t I give you your ‘financial security’ before we even got married? Now that we’re talking divorce, why should I care how you survive?”

I genuinely couldn’t fathom how she could say such things.

The wedding gifts given before marriage were security, the pre-marriage jewelry was security.

Now, if I were the one at fault, she’d seize my property as security.

And if a child got sick, she’d take the security and continue her life.

As a family, shouldn’t we share risks? Why was a human life worth less than a so-called comfortable life?

When she heard I wouldn’t leave penniless, Eleanor started acting hurt again, wiping away tears and sobbing.

“Children cost a lot of money, and I don’t have any other income. How are a single mother and her child supposed to survive? After all these years as husband and wife, shouldn’t you take full responsibility?”

Wasn’t I responsible enough? The moment I found out about Liam’s illness, I contacted the bank to apply for a loan, ready to sell everything to pay for his treatment!

Now, the tables were turned. I just wanted to hear her say *one word* about saving my daughter, just one word!

But her? One moment she was calling my daughter a worthless money pit, the next she was demanding I leave with nothing. Was that *my* lack of responsibility?

Seeing that I wouldn’t budge, Eleanor sat next to me, took my arm, and softened her voice.
