The next second, Eleanor, her face haggard, dropped straight to her knees in front of Bella, weeping uncontrollably.

“Please, honey, Mom is begging you. Our family really doesn’t have that much money. Can we just not treat it? We’ll make sure you’re happy for the time you have left. I’m still young, I don’t want to beg on the streets!”

“Yeah, sis, I just accidentally pushed you earlier, and I apologized. Can you just die without dragging me down?” Liam, still kneeling beside them, added.

“But what if? What if I get better, can things go back to how they were?” Bella looked at Eleanor, still hopeful and innocent.

Eleanor grew impatient, her voice sharp as she massaged her forehead and retorted, “How many ‘what ifs’ are there? Even if you get better, can the money spent on you be brought back?”

That simple sentence extinguished the last flicker of hope I had for saving Liam.

“We’re just ordinary people, we only get one chance to gamble. If we lose, our lives will be ruined because of you alone. When you said ‘face it together,’ weren’t you just trying to drag us down with you?”

“Mommy and your brother are people too. We don’t ask for great wealth, just a stable life. Can’t you be considerate of Mommy?”

With that, she even managed to squeeze out a few fake tears.

Liam quickly handed her a tissue, then stood up and glared at me.

“The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. Both of them are selfish, they don’t consider our feelings at all!”

“Mom, you two should get divorced immediately. I don’t want to go to hell with these two selfish people!”

Watching them, I couldn’t help but reflect on their words.

Yes, why should I gamble my entire future and Bella’s future for a slim chance at saving *her* son?

Seeing that Bella couldn’t be swayed either, Eleanor stood up and looked at me coldly, speaking her true thoughts.

“There’s only one illness in this world: poverty. I’m terrified of being poor. I’m just looking out for my own best interests.”

I looked at her假惺惺 (hypocritical/feigned) demeanor with a bitter smile, shaking my head helplessly.

As for the truth about Liam’s illness? If she was going to look out for her own interests, why couldn’t I?

“You’re right. I don’t need you to bear any of this.”

Hearing me say that, a glimmer of delight flickered in Eleanor’s eyes. She quickly handed over the divorce papers, striking while the iron was hot.

“It’s best if you understand. We’re both thinking of the children, so there’s no need to blame each other.”

Just then, my phone rang.

It was the bank.

“Mr. David, we’ve reviewed your credit score and spending history. Your approved loan amount is fifty thousand dollars.”

Hearing the call, Liam’s face changed.

“You took out a loan? Why didn’t you discuss something this big with my mom?”

Eleanor’s face contorted.

“Oh, I see now. I finally understand you. You never considered Liam and me family at all! Confess honestly, were you planning to use that loan to treat that worthless money pit and make *me* share the debt with you?”

“I can’t believe you’re this kind of person. We’re getting divorced anyway, can’t we just be civil to each other?”

I looked at her helplessly. “We’re getting divorced anyway, what’s wrong with me taking out a loan to treat my child on my own?”

Eleanor stared at me, her neck stiff, and shouted.

“What’s wrong? If you take out a loan for her treatment now, it becomes shared debt, and *we* have to bear it too!”

Liam wasn’t to be outdone, threatening, “You old man, if you make my mom take on that debt, I’ll strangle that b*tch! I’m underage, so I won’t even go to jail!”

I turned to look at him, a chill running through me at the venom in his eyes. This little devil would say *anything* to avoid debt!

Eleanor patted my shoulder.

“I don’t care if you want to take out a loan for treatment, but don’t make me share the debt, okay?”

With words like that, I truly felt that all my efforts for them over the years were worthless.

If Bella hadn’t had the foresight to test them, I would probably have been completely fooled.

I sighed.

“Alright then, let’s get divorced now. I’m in a hurry to get the money for treatment. This house goes to me, and the rest of the assets go to you, how about that?”

Hearing me say this, Eleanor, barely concealing her smile, modified the agreement and watched intently as I signed the divorce papers.

I pulled out the notarized prenuptial agreement from the cabinet and handed it to her.

Eleanor looked at the pre-marriage property notarization, and her smile slowly froze. “What is the meaning of this?”
