It was stiflingly hot inside the mascot suit, yet I felt as if I’d plunged into an ice bath.

It was only then that I saw her. In the enormous room, Seraphina was sprawled lazily on the couch, carelessly swirling the wine in her glass, like an untouchable queen.

"Looks alright. I'll call my daughter and ask if she likes it."

As Seraphina picked up her phone, my daughter’s unique ringtone sounded in my ears.

But soon, her brows furrowed, and her eyes instantly filled with confusion and worry, because Seraphina had called Chloe several times, but the calls went straight to voicemail.

My whole body trembled, tears streaming down my face.

Seraphina, you killed our daughter! You’ll never reach this number again!

Dominic was close to me. Hearing my fingernails scratch against the mascot suit, he glanced at me.

"Sera! You have such incredible patience, pretending to be poor and sick for seven years, tricking Julian, a brilliant graduate from a top university, into slaving away for you, while you, an heiress, condescended to play house with them."

Seraphina scoffed. "Once I win the bet, I'll bring them back to the Sterling estate. They won't have to suffer anymore."

Catching the hint of guilt in Seraphina's voice, I looked at her sharply.

"Now you're putting on the act of a good wife and mother. But why didn't you give Julian money when he asked you for it just now?"

"Why are you meddling in my affairs? If he's asking for my help, it must be because my mother-in-law's condition has worsened."

Seraphina's tone was assertive. "Next month, I'll find the best doctors to cure my mother-in-law!"

"His mom is sick, how could he possibly help you pay?"

Dominic's laughter grated on my ears. Seraphina looked embarrassed.

"He *will* help me! If you don't believe me, I can call him right now and ask him for the money!"

My mind went blank. I instinctively raised my clumsy arm, trying to find my phone.

It wasn't until I heard the busy signal that I realized I'd left my phone in my bag before work.

"Damn it! What time is it, and he's not answering my calls!"

Dominic casually glanced at me.

"That's why I say, all poor people are the same. What's love in the face of money? There are plenty of people who would sell their dignity."

Seraphina's eyes grew colder and colder. Suddenly, she stood up and walked over to me.

The next second, her cold eyes stared directly at me, as if piercing through the bulky mascot suit to see my face.

Had she finally recognized me?!

Just as tears streamed down my face and I prepared to rip off the mascot head to demand what I meant to her, she suddenly spoke.

"Would *you* sell your dignity for money?"

My hand slowly dropped. I said nothing.

Seraphina pulled a stack of money from a nearby box and slapped it against my face.

"Get down on your knees!"

She yanked my arm, a cold smile on her face, and dumped the entire box of money over my head.

Under her icy gaze, I slowly bent down, kneeling before her to pick up the scattered banknotes.

I had no reason to refuse this money.

With this money, I could buy a better burial plot for my mom and Chloe.

"See? Typical poor people, they pick up money the moment they see it! Hey, let me ask you, if I gave you money and told you to die, would you just obediently do it?"

"But Julian is different from you! He's with me only because he loves me, not for money, so whatever I say, he'll believe it!"

I lifted my head, meeting Seraphina's eyes through the mascot head. I chuckled self-mockingly.

"You're right!"

I *am* one of those poor people you talk about! For money, I can also sell my dignity!

The moment Seraphina heard my voice, her pupils constricted, and she instinctively reached to pull off my mascot head.

But I didn't dodge. In fact, I was almost looking forward to seeing her reaction when she saw who was under the mask.

Dominic pressed down on her hand, scoffing playfully, "Sera, Julian might have upset you, but you shouldn't take it out on a mascot, should you?"

Seraphina angrily yanked her hand away from Dominic's grasp and glared at me. "Now get lost."


Seraphina didn't come home that night.

It wasn't until the next morning that I received a text from her.

"Julian, my condition relapsed yesterday, and I fainted and was taken to the hospital. I just woke up."

"How's Mom's condition? And have you collected enough money for me?"

This wasn't the first time Seraphina had used this excuse for staying out all night.

Expressionless, I packed all my belongings and shipped them away, then headed to the address Seraphina's assistant had given me.

As I walked into the high-end restaurant, I immediately spotted Seraphina's familiar back in the distance.

Chloe's phone watch in my pocket was still buzzing. Seraphina had been calling it incessantly since yesterday evening.
