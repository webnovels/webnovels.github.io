The day my daughter was admitted to the ICU, Damien boarded a flight to the States, his first love, Seraphina, and her daughter right by his side.

The man who once swore he'd be my and Chloe's safe harbor had fled, taking every last penny with him.

When the private investigator finally tracked him down, he only had one message for me.

“Seraphina already lost her husband. I can’t let her lose her daughter too.”
“When I return, I’ll give you the grand wedding you deserve.”

Three years later, Damien returned.

And I saw the news of Damien's wedding… on TV.

“Mommy, why is Daddy marrying someone else?”
“That's not your dad.”
