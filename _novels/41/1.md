I carefully recorded and saved this conversation between Lucas and Natalie as evidence, then quickly left Lucas's study.

Unexpectedly, as soon as I opened the study door, I ran into Lucas face to face.

Lucas's brow furrowed almost instantly:

"What are you doing in my study?"

In our four years of marriage, he had showered me with affection and even allowed me to work in the Foster family's company, but he never let me near two places: his study at home and a specific room in his office at the company.

Before he could finish speaking, I fearfully threw myself into his arms, choking back tears:

"Lucas, I just had another nightmare. I dreamed of my sister covered in blood when she died. I was so scared, but I couldn't find you anywhere, not even in your study..."

The coldness in Lucas's demeanor instantly melted away. He raised his hand to hold my waist, while his other hand gently patted my back to comfort me:

"It's okay, I'm here. Don't be afraid."

"I know Claire's death has been a constant pain for you all these years, but now that the culprit is behind bars, we should move on and live our lives well."

I trembled in his embrace, but my heart was filled with nothing but surging hatred.

Lucas still didn't know that I had long since discovered his involvement in my sister's death, even though Natalie was the only apparent culprit on the surface.

The reason Lucas chose to marry me was nothing more than an act to fool me. It was all to help his beloved stepsister Natalie escape legal punishment.

Thinking of this, I fought back my nausea and cried even harder in his arms.

Lucas put aside all his work and patiently comforted me for a long time, driven by guilt.

After I had calmed down, he hesitantly spoke:

"Honey, I need to tell you something... Natalie has been released from prison. She's coming back tomorrow."

Seeing me freeze, he hurriedly added: "I shouldn't be telling you this right now, but you know, she's still related to me by family ties. Even though she committed a terrible crime, she has to come home. But I'm worried..."

This usually decisive CEO's voice grew softer as he spoke, filled with uncertainty.

It was indeed cruel to ask the victim's family to accept the return of the culprit.

Especially since I was his wife.

But I just wiped away the tears from the corners of my eyes and smiled gently, without even furrowing my brow:

"I understand your concerns. I'll be fine."

I looked up and gently caressed his brow: "You've done so much for me, even choosing justice over family. I should let it go too."

Hearing this, Lucas's hand on my back suddenly tightened, and he kissed my forehead.

"Chloe, I'll be good to you for the rest of my life."

I chuckled lightly and pushed him away: "Come on, we're an old married couple now. Stop being so mushy."

"Since Natalie is out of prison, we should throw her a welcome party to ward off bad luck. Let me take care of it."

Lucas breathed a sigh of relief and hugged me tightly, but the guilt in his eyes deepened.

"Chloe, my sweet Chloe, you're so good. I'll never let you go in this lifetime."

I leaned on his shoulder, smiling sarcastically.

Is that so?

Well, let me show you just how "good" I can be.
