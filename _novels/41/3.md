He furrowed his brow and immediately let go of Natalie, sternly saying:

"No one is to bring up that incident again. Why are you imagining all this?"

Natalie's lips parted slightly, looking at Lucas in disbelief.

I stepped forward to intervene:

"It's okay, Lucas. Natalie probably didn't mean it. I'm fine."

"Today is supposed to be a happy occasion. Let's not ruin it over something so trivial."

Lucas's face remained grim as he coldly led Natalie away.

As the onlookers dispersed and the party continued, I secretly followed them.

In a corner on the second floor, Natalie finally couldn't hold back and shook off Lucas's hand, complaining in a coquettish tone:

"Brother, you're hurting me! And why won't you believe me? Why are you siding with an outsider instead?"

Seeing Natalie's aggrieved expression, Lucas let out a long sigh, his tone softening:

"We both know the truth of what happened. Chloe has been through a lot too. You should let it go."

Natalie's eyes widened, looking at Lucas as if she didn't recognize him:

"What are you saying? Brother, don't tell me you actually think of Chloe as your real wife. You only married her to help me escape punishment!"

"It's been years since that incident, and I've served my fake sentence. It's time for you to dump her!"

Lucas shook his head, "We owe her too much. I've prepared myself to spend the rest of my life making it up to her."

But as he turned to leave, Natalie hugged him from behind:

"I don't believe it! Lucas, you like me, don't you? We're not blood-related. I know you love me, otherwise why would you do so much for me?"

Lucas froze as if struck by her words. His hands trembled slightly.

Finally, giving in to his desires, he turned around, cupped Natalie's face, and kissed her fiercely.

I silently stopped recording, saved the video, and left the second floor.

When Lucas brought Natalie down from the second floor, the party was coming to an end.

He couldn't find me anywhere and only discovered me crying in the storage room when we got home.

Hearing him open the door, I pretended not to notice and cried even harder.

"Chloe!"

Lucas rushed over to hug me, frowning as he spoke:

"I was wondering where you'd disappeared to. What happened? Why are you crying like this?"

I quickly turned my head away, hastily wiping away my tears with my sleeve before forcing a smile and facing him:

"It's nothing. I just twisted my ankle while tidying up earlier. I hid here because I was afraid you'd laugh at me..."

Lucas stared at me, his eyes full of pity: "Chloe, don't you know that your smile is the most forced when you're lying? I can see right through it."

"I..." I nervously glanced away.

He wiped away my unshed tears with his knuckle, "Tell me, why were you hiding here crying?"

I bit my lip, holding back for a moment before hooking my arms around his neck and letting my sobs break free.

"At the party, Natalie mentioned my sister. It made me think that if Claire were still alive, she'd be about Natalie's age now..."

"But I'll never get to see her grow up."

As I mentioned my sister, a flash of panic crossed Lucas's eyes, quickly replaced by guilt.

His grip on my waist tightened as he said remorsefully:

"It's all my fault. I was so busy with the party that I neglected your feelings. Tell me, honey, what can I do to make you feel better?"

I lowered my eyes and shook my head:

"You don't need to do anything. Just letting me see you often is enough."

"Lucas, can I come to your office more often from now on? I've been having nightmares lately, dreaming that you've left me. I... Could we have meals together and talk more? Maybe that would help."

Lucas frowned hesitantly. He had always avoided letting me into his office.

Because in there, he kept many secrets he didn't want me to know.

I withdrew my arms, forcing a light laugh: "If you're too busy, forget it. I was just thinking out loud."

"Lying again." He gently tapped my forehead, smiling tenderly. "Of course I can fulfill such a small request."

I brightened visibly and kissed his cheek, "You're the best, honey!"

The look of delight on his face didn't seem fake, a spark of fire dancing in his eyes.

Lucas happily picked me up in his arms, and I nestled my face against his neck in feigned shyness.

I almost couldn't hide the disgust in my eyes...
