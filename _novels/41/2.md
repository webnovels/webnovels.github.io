Over these four years, I wasn't just the respected and beloved Mrs. Foster; I was also a valuable asset to Foster Enterprises.

Many profitable business plans were my ideas, and I fought for many employee benefits as well.

Two years ago, when Lucas said the company was facing difficulties and urgently needed to cooperate with West Corporation, I agreed.

Charlie West was my ex-boyfriend, the one who abandoned me when I sought justice for my sister and instead hired a top lawyer for Natalie.

But at that time, for the sake of Lucas's company's development, I reconciled with Charlie without batting an eye.

Now, once again for Lucas's sake, I proactively suggested throwing a welcome party for the murderer of my sister.

How could he not be moved by such devotion?

How could our friends and family who knew the situation not like someone like me?

At the welcome party, the elite of Ocean City gathered.

Natalie, dressed in a gorgeous red gown, entered gracefully on Charlie's arm.

Her composed demeanor and arrogant attitude didn't resemble someone who had just been released from prison at all.

Instead, she looked like she had just returned from a vacation abroad.

Of course, she had indeed just returned from abroad, and Lucas had personally picked her up from the airport.

Natalie immediately spotted Lucas standing beside me.

She ran over and threw herself into Lucas's arms.

"Brother, I've missed you so much! I was wrongfully imprisoned for four years, but now we can finally see each other!"

As she spoke, her eyes, filled with jealousy and hatred, darted towards me like daggers. She added in a spoiled tone, as if showing off:

"This welcome party is so beautiful! Did you prepare all this for me, brother? I love it!"

Lucas fondly ruffled her hair: "All of this was arranged by Chloe. Come, say hello to your sister-in-law."

The smile on Natalie's face instantly froze.

She turned her gaze to me, forcing out a fake smile and greeted me briefly.

As the party officially began, Natalie flitted through the crowd like a social butterfly, her eloquent performance drawing bursts of laughter.

But I could feel her gaze, seemingly present yet absent, closely following me.

Finally, when Lucas went to the restroom, Natalie approached me.

At the time, I was resting in a corner of the party.

Without a word, she took a glass of red wine and splashed it on my face.

"Oh my, I'm so sorry, sister-in-law! I wanted to come over and toast you, to thank you for preparing such a lavish party for me, but I accidentally spilled it on your face."

"Are you okay? Do you need me to help you clean up?"

Despite her words, she just stood in front of me, smiling mockingly, showing no intention of helping me at all.

I took out a handkerchief to wipe the water from my face, revealing a calm smile:

"It's alright. Go enjoy yourself. I'll just wash up in a bit."

My nonchalant attitude seemed to ignite Natalie's anger.

She slammed the wine glass down on the nearby table, no longer trying to hide her malice towards me:

"Chloe Hayes, what are you playing at, acting all magnanimous? Don't think I don't know your little tricks. Are you planning to act pitiful so my brother will sympathize with you? You're way out of your league!"

Her gaze shifted to something behind me, and she suddenly leaned close to my ear, smiling as she said:

"Guess what? Do you think my brother would allow someone who maliciously bullies his sister to continue being his wife?"

As she spoke, she raised her hand and slapped herself hard across the face, her eyes immediately brimming with tears.

Lucas quickly rushed over to protect the seemingly faltering Natalie in his arms.

"Natalie, what happened?"

Natalie curled up pitifully in Lucas's arms, her lips quivering as tears fell like broken strings of pearls.

"I just wanted to come over and toast Chloe, but she called me shameless. She not only slapped me but also grabbed the wine from my hand and splashed it on her own face, trying to frame me for bullying her."

Lucas immediately looked at me, seeing the wine dripping down my face and staining my dress.

"Brother, I don't understand why Chloe is treating me like this. Is it still because of that car accident? But I really didn't mean to, and I've already served four years in prison for it. Why won't she let it go..."

Lucas's face quickly darkened, but not towards me. Instead, it was directed at Natalie.
