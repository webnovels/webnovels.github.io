Once again, as I watched Olivia Baker cling to Daniel Thompson in front of me, I no longer felt much of anything.

But he still refused to let me go, speaking in a commanding tone.

"Olivia is due to give birth in a few days. Quit your job and stay home to take care of her food and daily needs."

Hearing this, I suddenly realized that these five years of marriage seemed meaningless.

"Daniel, let's get divorced."

...

After a brief silence, mocking laughter erupted from the karaoke room.

"Did I hear that right? Rachel wants to divorce Daniel? Wasn't she the one who desperately clung to him in the first place?"

"Don't fight me on this, I bet she'll be back on her knees begging Daniel to take her back within a day!"

"Sis, what's gotten into you? Are you jealous of Olivia?"

"What, are you feeling sorry for her?" Daniel coldly retorted, his gaze towards me growing icy. "Are you sure about this?"

"Yes, I'll send you the divorce papers."

With that, I turned to leave, but Daniel suddenly called out to stop me.

"Rachel Wilson, don't forget, your half-dead parents still need the Thompson family's support."

He dared to bring up my parents.

Seeing I remained silent, he stood up and looked down at me imperiously, his tone threatening.

"You'd better think it through. Do you know how much your parents' annual medical expenses are? Can you afford it?"

Olivia chimed in from the side.

"That's right, sis. Uncle and auntie are still waiting for life-saving treatment."

I glared at their hypocritical faces, wanting nothing more than to slap them both.

Meeting my reddened eyes, Daniel spoke coldly: "Name your price. How much to take care of Olivia?"

How much was five years of a marriage where I was treated like dirt worth?

I didn't bother to calculate.

I only knew that the last time I refused him, I ended up being forced to drink with executives at a karaoke bar until I had a gastric hemorrhage.

I took Olivia's hand and pretended to say to her:

"I'll take good care of you and the baby."

Hearing this, Daniel surprisingly gave me an out: "Don't worry, as long as you take good care of them, your parents will be safe and sound too."

Just as he finished speaking, Olivia, whose hand I was holding, suddenly collapsed to the ground with a miserable cry.

I stood there stunned, not knowing what to do. Daniel slapped me hard across the face.

He carried her back to the bedroom and ordered the housekeeper to call the family doctor.

Seeing this situation, not only did the people around find it amusing.

I found it funny too.

Following them into the bedroom, seeing Olivia's emotions had calmed, I turned to leave.

But Daniel coldly grabbed my hand.

"Apologize!"

"What..."

Before I could finish, he kicked the back of my leg.

With a thud, I fell to my knees in front of Olivia before I could react. My knees were bleeding, but I heard him yell angrily:

"You made Olivia fall, shouldn't you apologize to her?!"
