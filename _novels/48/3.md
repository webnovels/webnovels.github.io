When I opened my eyes after fainting from shock, I saw Daniel dealing with work matters.

Our eyes met for a long while. He picked up a glass of water and moved to feed me.

But I shook my head and took the glass, drinking it all in one go.

Seeing this, Daniel's outstretched hand paused. His chest visibly heaved as he spoke with some displeasure:

"How are you feeling? Better? I only just found out that uncle and auntie had passed away..."

Before he could finish, I cut him off:

"Please give me back my phone."

Perhaps my tone was too cold. Daniel was stunned for several seconds before handing me the phone from the table.

Glancing at the divorce agreement I had drafted on the phone, he frowned and asked unhappily:

"Rachel, who's getting divorced?"

I hadn't seen him ask so many questions before. Feeling irritated, I spoke directly:

"Us."

Hearing my reply, he spoke with displeasure:

"How long are you going to keep this up? Your parents' deaths were an accident. Don't you trust me?"

I waved my hand, not wanting to get into this trouble. My tone was calm:

"I was just joking."

He immediately breathed a sigh of relief, changing his tone to comfort me:

"I know you're heartbroken about mom and dad passing, but you can't joke about things like this."

I didn't answer. The next moment, his assistant walked in to tell him:

"Mr. Thompson, Miss Baker is awake and asking to see you."

Seeing him torn, I lay down and closed my eyes:

"Go see her. I'm a bit tired and want to sleep."

Before leaving, he leaned close to my ear and instructed:

"Cooperate well with the doctors' treatment. I'll come see you after I check on her."

I kept my eyes tightly shut without responding. Only when the room was completely quiet did my tense body finally relax.

But the next second, a call from an unfamiliar number came through on my phone.

I answered reluctantly, my tone cold:

"What is it?"

But the other person didn't care about my strange tone, excitedly saying:

"Rachel! Chris is back!"

One sentence made my brain short-circuit. I asked in disbelief:

"What did you say?!"

"Chris Carter has completed his mission! He's returned to base!"

I almost instinctively jumped out of bed, yanking out the annoying IV in my hand, and rushed out of the hospital to take a taxi to the military base in the suburbs.

And in my heart, I silently started the divorce countdown.

In three days, I would completely leave Daniel Thompson.

Reuniting with Chris Carter was an extremely difficult thing. He had been traumatized and forgotten me completely.

He wouldn't allow anyone to approach him, just mumbling words others couldn't understand:

"Silly girl, silly girl... I want to see my silly girl!"

But I knew he was calling my nickname.

The doctor told me that to fully recover, we would need to go to America to find the top medical team, with only a 50% chance of success.

As my phone screen lit up, I turned my gaze to the divorce agreement on my phone.

My thoughts drifted to Daniel Thompson. I silently modified the terms from "adultery during marriage, assets split 50/50" to "I don't want a penny."

I wanted to sever all ties with him.

At this moment, Daniel also called me, anxiously asking:

"Rachel, where are you? Why aren't you resting properly in the hospital?"

I was immersed in the joy of reunion, but had to perfunctorily respond to him:

"What is it? I'm very busy right now."

"I've neglected you these past few days. I want to take you to the new product auction to make it up to you."

Seeing I didn't respond, he persisted:

"How about tomorrow? The Zhike Ziye new product auction. I'll take you to see if there's anything you like."

These words touched me a little.

But his next words slapped me in the face again:

"But Olivia is insisting on going to the Bund with me. Tomorrow I'll take you after I get back."

I smiled mockingly, simply replying with a "Mm" and agreeing to his trap.

If I still liked him because of my parents before, I would definitely have a big fight with him.

Then sulk alone, but now I wanted to leave and didn't care about anything he did.

After all, divorce is no small matter. I had to prepare a big gift for him.

Seeing I agreed, he didn't think much more of it, tossing aside my unusual behavior.

He thought I would be like before, comforting myself and then eagerly going back to him.

But I had already awakened and wouldn't make the same mistake again.

Daniel Thompson, you and your illusory love.

I don't want any of it anymore.
