"What do you mean?"

Jason stood up.

"I'm saying, let's break up."

Fiona whispered, "Is she not cured yet?"

Jason frowned.

He grabbed my wrist, pulling me into his arms.

His other hand fell on my waist.

The physical reaction came quickly.

From my stomach to my throat, I couldn't stop the violent convulsions.

I suddenly pushed him away, barely covering my mouth in time as vomit spilled through my fingers onto the carpet.

Everyone was shocked.

Including Jason himself.

Only I was already used to it, grabbing some tissues to wipe my fingers clean.

"Are you satisfied now?"

Jason's face grew even darker.

"You can't even have normal contact with men now, and you still want to break up with me?"

"Yes. Even so, I want to break up."

I turned to leave.

This time Jason didn't stop me.

Maybe because I had passed the physical test, his emotions stabilized.

"Sophia, no one else will accept you except me."

"If you walk out that door today, don't ever beg me to take you back!"

I never looked back.

I leaned against the wall in the hallway, my vision blurring under the swaying lights, growing increasingly dizzy.

I immediately realized Fiona's drink had been spiked.

Someone was following me from behind. I forced myself to stay alert, walking quickly forward without showing any signs.

Just as I turned the corner, I crashed into a man's arms.

I tried to push him away, but then I stopped.

I just waited quietly for a moment.

The physical aversion reaction didn't come.

In fact, I felt the relief of the drug's effects being alleviated.

"Sophia, how long are you going to hug me?"

The man's backlit features held a teasing smile.

It was Ethan, the heir to the Qin family.

He used to be friends with Jason and had even spoken up for me before, but I heard they had a falling out later.

Ethan felt my forehead with his hand.

"Looks like you've been drugged. I'll take you to find Jason."

"No, we broke up," I looked at him steadily, my voice calm. "Besides, he can't help me."

Ethan tilted his head, staring at me with a smile, his hand hovering near my waist.

"Then what do you suggest we do?"

His voice was soft, but to my ears, it was incredibly alluring.

With my last bit of strength, I wrapped my arms around his neck.

My lips brushed against his cheek, slowly stopping at his ear.

"Ethan, can you... help me?"

His arm tightened forcefully around my waist.

Ethan looked down at me, his eyes dark with meaning.

"Sophia, you're not even asking if I'm willing, just if I can?"

"I can't take it anymore, please."
