I was helped off the stage by a teacher from the purification program.

Jason came over and asked what was wrong.

I said I was just too nervous.

Once the door closed, the teacher took out a small bottle of blue reagent.

I quickly drank it, suppressing the nausea.

"Sophia, you've always performed excellently. How could you recall such things in public?"

The purification program had specially assigned an English-speaking teacher for me.

I smiled helplessly: "Teacher, I didn't. I just thought about my boyfriend cheating."

The teacher sighed as well.

The purification program presented itself as psychological courses to the outside world.

But what actually worked was the consumption of drugs that forcibly suppressed desire.

As soon as you had intimate fantasies about your designated partner, you would immediately start vomiting uncontrollably.

At first I was very resistant, but after trying to fantasize about other men and having no reaction, I became indifferent.

I didn't care about Jason, I just wanted to leave early, so I took a lot of the medication.

I don't know if there were any side effects.

When I opened the door, Jason tried to take my hand, but I instinctively avoided it.

He froze for a moment, then withdrew his hand and curved his lips into a smile.

He was very satisfied with the results of my "learning."

Jason decided to take me back home.

The purification program gave him a course of medication.

"If Sophia's condition becomes unstable, you can administer it according to the instructions."

Jason asked, "What do you mean by unstable?"

But the teacher didn't explain, only giving vague answers.

"Some students may experience withdrawal symptoms. Taking the medication will help."

Jason took me back to the country.

He kept me locked up in a villa, with people monitoring me 24 hours a day.

But I showed no abnormalities.

Half a month later, he took me out.

In a spacious private room, the contoured lights flowed, each face appearing and disappearing.

This was the first time I met his friends.

"How come you finally brought her out?"

Jason sat down, patting the seat beside him.

I sat next to him.

"Sophia just got back from abroad. I was worried she'd be bored at home."

The light swept across the face of the girl opposite us.

She was the female lead in that photo.

Fiona, Jason's childhood sweetheart from a suitable family background.

She handed me a drink, asking curiously: "I've heard about this kind of thing before. I mentioned it to Jason. Can it really purify desires?"

So it was her who had instigated Jason to send me away.

And apparently everyone knew about my trip abroad.

I downed that glass of wine, looking at Jason.

I put the glass upside down on the table.

"It can. I no longer have any desire for Mr. Xu."
