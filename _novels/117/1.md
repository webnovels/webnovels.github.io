I quickly wrapped myself with a tablecloth, fumbling to end the live stream. Asher smirked, satisfied: "This is what you deserve for causing my mom's death.

This is your punishment!" "Letting you live without making you pay with blood is already merciful!" He was only eight years old, so it's clear where he learned such words. I frowned and explained, "Your mother's death had nothing to do with me."

Years ago, my foster sister Adeline Carter died in a drunk-driving accident; I wasn't even there. Asher's expression showed a hint of guilt.

He kicked the table and stormed off, his face full of anger. In the past, I would have chased after him, patiently explaining. But now, I silently returned to my room.

I didn't expect to find all the clothes prepared for the event slashed and torn, scattered on the ground. Especially the Xiangyun silk dress ordered by a client—it was completely destroyed.

The fabric was out of stock and couldn't be quickly remade.

Behind me, I heard Asher's gleeful laughter. He held a pair of scissors, looking menacing: "Nora Carter, who told you to take my mom's eyes?"

"I want you to know what it's like to lose something." He plunged the scissors into a cloth doll on the table, his eyes filled with malice.

I stood amidst the destruction, speechless as I watched him leave. Years ago, after being abducted for over a decade, I returned home, only to find Adeline had already won everyone's hearts.

The home I longed for was not as warm as I imagined. After her death, my mother sent me to the Thompson family.

Declan's only request was for me to bear the child for him and Adeline.

At 30, I've never known the love of family. The child I carried for ten months and raised for eight years now sees me as an enemy. My eyes felt dry and painful; my heart seemed encased in ice. I kneeled to clean up the mess.

A pair of feet stopped in front of me. Looking up, I saw Declan Thompson with his eyes downcast, sighing. His gaze was gentle, but his voice was cold and distant: "Nora, you were wrong from the start." He extended a hand to me as if offering charity: "Asher is only eight years old; he needs your full attention."

As I stood up, the torn fabric fell again to the ground. Declan's gaze softened, maybe pitying my futile struggle. "You should cherish Adeline's eyes.

I've seen you stay up late to design sketches. What if you damage her eyes?" "Take this opportunity to close your online store.

I'll help with the compensation." His hand caressed my face, intensely staring into my eyes: "Be good. You know why I keep you around." Of course, I understood.

Because of these eyes that once belonged to Adeline Carter. Someone can love another so obsessively. Every time we were intimate, he wouldn't let me close my eyes. Through me, he was looking at another woman.

I served them wholeheartedly for eight years but never warmed their hearts. He pulled me into his embrace, his hot breath on my neck.

"Nora, if you're really lonely." "I might allow you to give me a child." His lips were warm and soft, landing on my cheeks and lips.

Though his embrace was burning hot, I felt like I was in an ice cave. Back then, Declan didn't want to accept me.

But my mother said Adeline had frozen her eggs early, and I could be the incubator for their love child. Only then did Declan agree.

Later, when he drunkenly pinned me down, his first words upon waking were: "Don't dream of having my child; you're not worthy." He watched me take birth control pills again and again.

Now, eight years later, faced with his rare generosity, I didn't feel grateful. Instead, I turned my head away from his kiss. "The eight-year term is up." "Declan Thompson, it's time for me to leave."
