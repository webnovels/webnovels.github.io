In college, Blake was a special recruit. With his good looks, he was adored by many girls.

But from the start of school, he wore a simple pinky ring, declaring himself a believer in staying single, telling others not to get close to him.

Friends often said Blake would surely end up alone for life.

But I took a particular interest in him and secretly approached him.

Unexpectedly, Blake didn't reject me alone, and even actively stuck to me.

I was skinny, so he would work at the cafeteria window I liked, always giving me extra meat.

I had trouble waking up, so he would run far every morning to buy my favorite breakfast, coaxing me to get up and eat in various ways.

It was my first time falling in love, and I naturally fell for his caring gestures.

We often appeared as a pair on campus, and although he never explicitly stated our relationship, I was content.

I felt sorry for him and often used money from home to supplement his living expenses while we were in school. After graduation, I was even willing to break ties with my parents to be with him.

Thinking back now, I feel very resentful.

Resentful of my years of dedication, but what's done is done, and I don't want to continue anymore.

Blake was a believer in staying single, and I had asked him many times when we would get married.

Now, I guess I've finally got my answer.

Since that's the case, I don't need to dwell on it anymore.

It's better to cut your losses on a mistake early.

As I walked out of the Pearson Group building, the sunlight was so bright it hurt my eyes.

In my bag was the newly signed equity transfer agreement.

As the daughter of the Chapman family, I always kept my word.

Back then, I had a big fight with my family to be with Blake.

But parents always have a soft heart despite their harsh words, and they had been secretly sending me money over the years, so I had some savings.

In the afternoon, Blake's call came through, his tone unpleasant.

"Zoe, what's going on? People in the company say you've resigned?"

"That's impossible, don't joke around."

"And why did Mr. Lee suddenly cancel? Go smooth things over quickly."

Blake's tone was rushed, but still composed.

After all, no matter what happened before, I would always clean up his messes.

But not anymore.

I brushed Blake off with a few vague responses and hung up the phone.

Looking at the files sent to my computer, they contained the information of Pearson Group's core employees, with several names highlighted in red - these were the backbone staff who had joined the company because of my abilities.

I took a sip of coffee and the screen showed that Blake had recently hired a female assistant with zero work experience, but her monthly salary was higher than that of department managers.

My phone lit up again, this time with a message from an unknown number.

"You think it's over just because you left? Mr. Pearson says you're just a dog that comes when called and leaves when told!"

The attached image was of Blake kissing Lily White.

A dense, sour feeling spread through my heart. I took a deep breath and blocked the number.
