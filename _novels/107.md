The popular guy decided to become the bodyguard for the heiress of my family, just so he could always be near me. We shared secret moments of freedom 99 times in the mansion's basement. The room was dark and windowless, with just a narrow single bed. Yet, he seemed to relish it. After each encounter, he'd hold me close and say it was all worth it for me. He'd often make grand promises, swearing to the sky. "One day, when I'm wealthy, I'll buy you a mansion this big, and I'll definitely marry you." His words pushed me to secretly juggle eight or nine jobs every day. But it wasn't to buy a grand house. It was to afford a better cochlear implant for his congenital deafness.

One day, while washing dishes at a restaurant, I unexpectedly ran into Declan. He was supposed to be working at the mansion.
