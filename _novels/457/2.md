The next day, I took out the suitcase I had prepared long ago and started packing.

Just as I was about to leave with my suitcase, the villa's front door was suddenly pushed open.

Olivia rushed in, her face filled with rage.

Without a word, she raised her hand and slapped me hard.

"Gabriel, I never thought you were this kind of person!"

"Lucas and Lily received an anonymous package. Guess what was inside? A dead rat!"

"Lily was so scared she broke down crying and now she's running a high fever!"

"If you have any grievances, come at me! Using such vicious methods against a girl, are you even a man?"

I looked at Olivia's face, twisted with anger, feeling utterly unfamiliar.

"I didn't do it," I said, my voice hoarse.

"If it wasn't you, who else could it be? I've told you before, I'm just playing around with them."

Olivia didn't believe me at all. The contempt and disappointment in her eyes hurt more than the slap.

"When I get bored of them, I'll naturally come back to you! Why can't you be more generous?"

"You agreed so nicely on the surface, but behind my back, you pull these dirty tricks! Gabriel, you're nothing but a hypocrite!"

Her words became increasingly harsh, even starting to speak recklessly.

"For someone of my status, isn't it normal to have a few lovers? Even your mom..."

She suddenly realized she had said something wrong and abruptly stopped.

My eyes instantly turned red. How dare she mention my mom.

Yes, she had long lost all trust in me.

From the moment she first met those twins, trust was gradually consumed.

The Olivia who once passionately pursued me for five whole years,

Would postpone our wedding for the first time because Lily had menstrual cramps, leaving me alone at the wedding venue.

Would force me to kneel and apologize in front of all company employees because of Lucas's false accusation.

Even my mother, who had treated her like her own daughter, was pushed down the stairs by the twins working together, dying with resentment.

Yet they brushed it off with a casual "accident."

And Olivia chose to believe them.

Thinking of this, my heart felt like it was being tightly squeezed by an invisible hand, making it hard to breathe.

Seeing my reddened eyes, Olivia seemed to feel a bit guilty.

She softened her tone and said, "Forget it. Lucas and Lily said they're very forgiving and won't hold it against you."

"But they really like this villa. You move out for a while, consider it compensation for them."

She used a patronizing tone to decide my fate.

Before I could open my mouth to argue, a pitiful mewing suddenly came from outside.

It was Mochi! The cat my mom left me!

My heart tightened, and I rushed out.

In the yard, the flowers and plants my mom had cherished most in life were trampled into a mess.

By the pool, Lucas was grinning maliciously, repeatedly dunking Mochi's tiny body into the water.

Lily stood nearby, clapping her hands and laughing hysterically.

I charged over and punched Lucas hard in the face.

The next moment, another heavy slap landed on my face.
