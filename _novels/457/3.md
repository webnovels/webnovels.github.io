Lily immediately threw herself into Olivia's arms, her voice tinged with tears:

"Olivia, look at him! He's a violent maniac! He just started hitting people!"

Olivia supported Lily and, seeing the injury on Lucas's face, even wanted to hit me again.

I ignored them and ran frantically to the poolside, pulling the motionless Mochi out of the cold water.

Her tiny body was already stiff, her wet fur clinging to her skin. She had stopped breathing completely.

Lucas covered his bleeding mouth corner and snarled preemptively.

"Olivia! Is this your idea of a sincere apology?"

Olivia's face turned ashen. She looked at me and commanded coldly, "Gabriel, apologize to them!"

"Apologize?" I raised my head, my eyes bloodshot. "They destroyed my mom's flowers and killed my cat! And you want me to apologize to them?"

"It was this beast that tried to bite me! My brother was just teaching it a lesson!" Lily hid behind Olivia, distorting the facts.

"Besides, this villa is ours now. We can do whatever we want with the flowers and plants here. It's none of your business!"

Olivia looked at the dead Mochi in my arms, a flash of heartache crossing her eyes.

But Lucas's exaggerated cries of pain quickly drew all her attention.

"Olivia, you must give me an explanation for the dead rat incident and this punch today!" Lucas insisted. "You can't always be so biased towards him! How can we siblings trust you in the future?"

Lily chimed in: "That's right, Olivia. The way he treats us, just making him move out is too lenient."

Olivia looked at her helplessly, her voice indulgent: "Then what do you want?"

Hearing this, Lily's gaze fell on Mochi in my arms.

"This cat almost bit me. Just dying like this isn't enough. It should be dismembered and thrown in the trash."

I shuddered, then heard Lucas say leisurely: "And Gabriel should do it himself. Doesn't he cherish this cat? Then let him send it off one last time."

I turned to Olivia, my voice tinged with pleading: "Olivia, please don't... This is what Mom left me..."

Olivia was flanked by the two, listening to their "grievances," her expression growing colder.

She finally ordered her bodyguards: "Go, bring a knife."

The bodyguards' faces flashed with hesitation.

"Hmph, even the dogs you keep are biased towards him. How can you expect us to trust you in the future?"

Seeing this, Olivia angrily scolded: "What? Are my words no longer effective?"

Under her angry rebuke, the bodyguard still brought a knife.

I was firmly held down by two bodyguards, a dull knife forced into my hand.

I closed my eyes tightly, feeling the flesh under the knife being repeatedly cut and ground,

While Lily's laughter rang in my ears.

I don't know how I managed to do it, only feeling my movements becoming increasingly numb.

Finally, my vision went black, and I passed out completely.
