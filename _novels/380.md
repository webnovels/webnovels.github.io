After summer break kicked off, my twin sister, Brooke, announced she was heading out to sea with some “hot shot” she’d met at a club, working as a yacht girl.

I scrolled through my Ins feed and found a post from that exact girl, Cassie.
“Tomorrow, an 18-year-old, fresh-out-of-high-school girl is joining me for a yacht trip. Dark-skinned gentlemen, reserve your spots now!”

In my previous life, I was so worried about Brooke going down the wrong path that I tried everything to stop her.
But she just laughed at me, calling me an old fossil, saying I deserved to be broke my whole life.
I couldn’t control her, so I secretly told our parents.
Brooke was grounded for the entire summer.
But Cassie, that yacht girl, ended up pregnant with the CEO’s child during her gig.
She transformed into a rich socialite overnight, even coming to brag in front of Brooke.
Brooke went absolutely insane with jealousy, convinced I had ruined her chance.
Our parents also came to hate me for losing out on a CEO as a son-in-law.
They stripped me naked, tied me up, and left me on our outdoor balcony, exposed to a scorching 104-degree heat all day.
I died from severe heatstroke, my organs cooked alive inside me.
When I opened my eyes again, I was back to the day Brooke said she was going for that gig.
I looked at Brooke, her eyes holding that look of pure, unadulterated stupidity, and I smiled.
This time, I’ll watch you fall, becoming a toy for those “dark-skinned gentlemen” with my own eyes.
