At this moment, Nora had already put on a pitiful look, tears in her eyes, pulling my arm.

I set down my chopsticks, rose to my feet, and said quietly, "Declan, let's get a divorce."

As soon as the words were out of my mouth, their faces changed. My son and Nora looked thrilled, while Declan seemed shocked, his brows knitting in displeasure.

"Adeline, you're asking for a divorce over some old book? Since when did you become so unreasonable?"

"Declan, don't speak about Adeline like that. The book is hers. If she doesn't want to give it to me, that's okay. I'll earn it through my own efforts."

At this point, Nora had already adopted a pitiful demeanor, tears shimmering in her eyes as she grasped my arm.

"Adeline, I know you've never really liked me. Now that you're back, I shouldn't be here in your home. But I truly care for Lachlan. If that's how you feel, I won't come anymore, and I don't need the book. It's all my fault. Please don't divorce Declan because of me."

My son jumped off his chair and glared at me fiercely. "If you don't like Aunt Nora, then you should leave. You're just a murderer. What right do you have to dislike Aunt Nora?"

Watching my seven-year-old son hitting me and shoving me to defend another woman broke my heart.

Amid the struggle, Nora let out a scream and fell to the ground. The next moment, my son charged at me, head-first into my stomach. I stumbled several steps back, my head hitting the wall hard, pain blurring my vision.

Before I could recover, Declan's furious eyes met mine. He slapped me hard across the face, yanked my hair, and said coldly:

"Adeline, how dare you, an ex-con, lay a hand on Nora? Apologize to her right now!"

I endured the sharp pain in my scalp, stubbornly looking at the man who once cherished me. Back then, even if my eyes just welled up, he would feel guilty and comfort me for ages. But now? He would hit me for another woman.

At that moment, I truly felt my heart shatter.

"Declan, is this what you meant by having me rely on you?"

Declan let go of my hair, a flicker of panic in his eyes, about to speak when Nora's soft sobs interrupted.

"Declan, Adeline, it's all my fault. I shouldn't have come between you. I'll leave now!"

My son clung to her hand, glaring at me as he spoke, "If anyone should leave, it's you. I don't have a murderer for a mother."

Declan also agreed with our son, "Adeline, it seems I've been too good to you. You should go out and clear your head. Think it over and then come back with the ancient manuscript for Nora. A useless person like you shouldn't hold onto something so valuable."

When I was pushed out and the door shut, I clearly saw Nora give me a triumphant, mocking smile.

I'm glad I discovered their true nature early on, so I'm not as devastated now. That place is no longer my home; staying would only make me feel sick.

I sat outside all night. At dawn, I knocked on the door slowly.

With a flight this afternoon, I have to retrieve my documents from the bedroom.

Nora opened the door in a slip dress, deliberately adjusting her hair over her shoulder to reveal her neck and the trail of hickeys down to her chest.

"Adeline, I'm really sorry. I wanted to come out to find you yesterday, but Declan was just too vigorous. We didn't stop until almost dawn. Fortunately, you came back on your own."

Even though I already knew about their relationship, seeing it with my own eyes still tightened my heart.

I said nothing, just walked inside.

At the bedroom door, I ran into Declan coming out. When he saw me, he was startled and spoke in a fluster.

"Adeline, when did you get back? I... let me explain, something came up last night, so Nora stayed over."

I glanced at the messy bedroom with clothes torn on the floor. Clenching my fists, I shook my head nonchalantly, "It's fine. When can I come in?"

Seeing my expressionless face, without anger, Declan was the one who became embarrassed and angry.

"Adeline, aren't you mad? Seeing me with another woman, don't you have any reaction?"

I blinked, "What reaction do you want from me? To make a scene or hit her? What's the point? You wouldn't allow it anyway."

Declan didn't expect me to respond like that, his brows furrowing tighter.

At this moment, Nora chimed in, standing by Declan’s side, "Declan, today we need to go to Washington D.C. early. If it’s inconvenient, I can go by myself."

Declan wrapped his arm around her waist, ordering me, "Two days from now, Nora needs to register. Our son and I will accompany her to Washington D.C. today. We won't be back for a while. Find the ancient manuscript quickly. Nora needs it for her exam in six months!"

I nodded. It's just an ancient manuscript, right? I'll give it to her. If I don't, they'll definitely keep pestering me, making it harder for me to leave.

When Nora got the ancient manuscript, her eyes were glowing.

Watching their backs as the three of them left, I gave a bitter smile.

I turned to the study, copying the recording of Declan’s conversation with our son from that day and took photos of the bedroom mess.

Just then, I received a text from Nora.

[Adeline, you’re really stupid. Did you really think that just giving me the manuscript would mean Declan would stay with you forever?]

[I’m not afraid to tell you, we’ve actually been together since before you went to prison. He said he fell in love with me long ago, and you’re just his responsibility.]

[Even your own son has called me mom for three years. The reason they never visited you during your three years in prison is because we lived together every day. What you thought was your home, I’ve actually lived in for three years.]

She sent pictures after that. There were intimate photos of her and Declan, and family photos with our son.

I didn't reply, just saved them one by one.

Everything about me in the bedroom, along with those photos, I threw into the trash downstairs.

After doing all this, I placed the signed divorce papers and wedding ring on the table. As I was about to leave with my luggage, Declan called.

His tone was gloomy, sounding conflicted: "Adeline, I haven’t forgotten my promise to you. I still have you in my heart."

"Actually, I..."

Before he could finish, I heard Nora calling him.

I replied calmly, "You go ahead."

"Adeline, I'll explain things when I get back. Wait for me."

I was tired of his fake promises and hung up, blocking all his contacts.

I've never felt so clear-headed as I do now.

Before boarding the plane, I sent all the evidence to my attorney.

Declan, weren't you helping Nora step over me to succeed?

Then I wish you smooth sailing.

I hope you like this big gift.

But I never expected another accident to happen along the way.
