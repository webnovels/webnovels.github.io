Late at night, I booked a flight for the next day.

I didn't expect Nora to come to my house the next day.

They were having a meal.

My son sat beside her, acting spoiled, calling her mom. Nora looked at Declan with a shy smile.

Declan lovingly stroked her hair. But in this beautiful, warm scene, I was the odd one out.

Nora was the first to see me. She smiled brightly.

"Oh, Adeline, sorry, I forgot you were here. Sit down, I'll get you a bowl of rice."

Nora quickly returned, placing a white bowl in front of me, contrasting with their pink ones.

I gripped my chopsticks so hard my knuckles turned white.

I remembered when I had just come back, I grabbed those three bowls from the cabinet, and Declan got so angry.

"Adeline, after being away for years, I'll tell you what you can and can't touch."

Even my son angrily dumped his food and hid the bowl like a treasure.

Now I realized those were the bowls for their 'family of three.'

Nora followed my gaze to the bowl, smirking, and spoke with satisfaction,

"Adeline, don't mind. This set of bowls was specially made by Declan for Lachlan. Kids like quirky things. Adeline, eat more, try my cooking. Declan and Lachlan say I cook well, give me your opinion."

Declan smiled, placing a chicken drumstick in her bowl, "Adeline won't overthink. But you, don't just care about others, eat more too."

My son pouted, pretending to be unhappy.

"Dad is so biased, only nice to Aunt Nora. Why don't you give me food?"

Declan helplessly gave him another drumstick.

"Just two drumsticks, one for you and one for Aunt Nora."

My son happily gnawed on the chicken, while Declan casually wiped the oil from Nora's mouth.

"Grown-up, yet eating like a messy cat."

Nora blushed, glancing at me, and pretended to be shy: "Adeline is here, don't let her misunderstand."

"Adeline is understanding, not a little girl, she won't get jealous or misunderstand."

I forced a bitter smile.

They seemed like a family, while I, the real wife, was the unnecessary outsider.

The next moment, Declan ordered with a justified tone,

"Adeline, Nora is practically your half-student. She wants to apply for Acupuncture Master Blake's disciple exam. I remember you have an ancient acupuncture manuscript, you don't need it anymore, give it to Nora!"

I've carefully kept that manuscript, it's the only clue to my real family. He knows that.

I clenched my fists, my voice hoarse and bitter,

"That ancient acupuncture manuscript is the only token my birth mother left me, I need it to find her, how could you..."

Declan's face darkened, and his tone turned impatient.

"After all these years, if your mother wanted to find you, she would've appeared. I'm helping you, so you won't dwell on unrealistic things. This isn't a discussion, I've promised it to Nora, get it out, the exam deadline is in three days, Nora needs to start studying."

Nora looked at me with a smug expression, "Adeline, Declan is doing this for your good, I think you should accept reality!"

Yes, with everything laid out, what am I holding on to?

I put down my chopsticks, stood up, and spoke slowly: "Declan, let's get a divorce."

As soon as I said it, their faces changed.

My son and Nora were full of joy.

Declan, on the other hand, frowned in shock, then looked displeased.

"Adeline, you're divorcing over a manuscript? When did you become so unreasonable?"

"Declan, don't say that to Adeline. The manuscript is hers, it's okay if she doesn't want to give it to me, I'll get in with my own efforts."
