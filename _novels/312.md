It had been three years since our breakup.

My childhood sweetheart, Liam, and I were back together again.

He treated me just as he always had, maybe even more thoughtfully than before.

I truly believed this time, we were finally on the right track, headed for a happy ending.

Until I happened to pass by the private booth next door.

I heard Liam’s friends teasing him.

"Didn't you say you were done with Chloe? How is this fair to Cassie?"

Inside the booth, Liam's eyes were slightly glazed over, but his words were crystal clear.

I watched him gently squeeze the slender neck of the girl beside him.

He chuckled, playfully chiding, "Cut the crap. Be there on time for the wedding next month."
