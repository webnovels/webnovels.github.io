William, who had been calm all along, panicked for the first time.

"Olivia is missing?"

"Aria! No wonder you've been acting so strange today. It seems you've done something bad and want to use fake suicide to clear your suspicions! Quick, tell me where you've taken Olivia!"

Finn immediately reddened his eyes and slapped me hard:

"Olivia went through so much to come back, and you dare to harm her! I should have let you drown in the river earlier!"

"Quickly give her back to me! If she dies, I won't live either!"

There was an iron rust taste in my mouth. I opened my lips, and a few drops of blood fell.

Olivia disappeared again. She really can't stand to see me have any good.

Since that's the case, I might as well fulfill her wishes.

I was about to speak when I saw Ryan, who once said I was his only salvation, holding a knife to my throat.

"Speak! Where did you hide my Olivia!"

Ryan, the fourth of my love interests, was also a well-known medical genius.

Back then, because someone wanted to steal his family's secret medical book, his entire family was killed. It was I who risked my life to save him.

Perhaps because he witnessed his entire family being killed, Ryan became extremely resistant to others approaching him.

There's still a scar on my left hand where he bit me when he was in shock.

But I never left him, accompanying him through that difficult time.

Finally, Ryan regained his senses and decided to practice his family's medical skills to find evidence and avenge his family.

In the silent struggle, I went through countless life and death moments, personally helping him reach a high position and slaughter all his enemies.

That day, he cried and said that from then on, I would be his sister, a relative without blood ties.

That day, I cried too, because he really looked like my brother from another world.

I... missed my brother.

But later, after Olivia appeared, he gradually distanced himself from me.

Just because Olivia said she didn't like me calling him brother.

He then declared that if I came within three meters of him, he would seal my throat with silver needles.

On the day he learned that Olivia had faked her death by jumping into the sea, Ryan went crazy.

He stuck tens of thousands of needles into my body, torturing me endlessly, just to avenge Olivia.

"Who knows how much Olivia suffered at your hands before she jumped into the sea to commit suicide."

"Since that's the case, then for each of your following days, you will suffer a hundred times more cruel torture than her!"

Seeing my silence, Ryan's eyes were filled with bloodshot, and the sharp blade pressed against my throat, drawing a line of blood.

"Not talking? It seems a few days without torture have made you forget our methods!"

Ryan coldly stepped forward, knocked me unconscious, and took me to the dark room in William's villa.

He stuck dense silver needles into my acupoints, amplifying my pain and torturing me with various instruments.

William and Finn didn't stop him, but instead gritted their teeth and glared at me with raging anger.

I struggled, and dense, stabbing pain came from all over my body. The pain penetrated to the bone, making me cry out involuntarily.

But Ryan slapped me hard and shouted:

"What are you yelling for? Can't you even bear this little pain? Don't forget how you tortured Olivia back then!"

"If you don't tell us her whereabouts, everything you did to her, I will return to you one by one!"

Hearing this, I opened my eyes wide, as if seeing dawn.

I don't want to be abused by them anymore. I just want to die quickly and cleanly.

I just want to go home and have a good sleep!

I cried, sobbed, and shouted:

"Your Olivia is already dead! I chopped her up piece by piece with a knife!"

"Come on! Kill me!! Let me accompany her!"

"Come on!!!"

I shouted crazily at them.

Ryan was probably too angry, even at this point I still dared to be so arrogant.

"You really think I don't dare to kill you? Olivia is dead, trash like you should accompany her!"

He suddenly took out a knife and rushed out, raising his hand to stab me.

He used full force, probably thinking I would resist, but I just stood there, watching the knife tip enter my heart.

Ryan was stunned, looking at the blood gushing from my chest, as if he couldn't believe it.

But I pulled the corners of my mouth, finally going to die!

As my consciousness dispersed, Olivia's voice suddenly came from the door:

"Oh, why is everyone here? I've been looking for you for a long time..."
