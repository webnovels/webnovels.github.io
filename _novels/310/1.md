I walked step by step into the river. The next moment, another hand grabbed me.

I turned back in confusion, only to find it was my brother Finn.

He was holding a cake with a big name written on it: "Olivia".

It should be a cake prepared to celebrate Olivia's fake death return...

Anger and hatred surged in Finn's eyes.

"What are you doing here? Don't tell me you knew I was going to bring a cake for Olivia and came to stop me?!"

"Aria, have you forgotten that I've already severed ties with you!"

In this world, if there's someone who hates me more than William, it would be my own brother.

But he wasn't like this before.

We lost both parents when we were young. I raised my brother alone, naming him "Finn", hoping he would be as free as the wind chimes dancing in the air.

He dreamed of studying music, so I dropped out of school early and worked three jobs to send him to the best training classes.

Once, during a house fire, he ran barefoot into the flames, crying that if I died, he wouldn't live alone either.

We were each other's support in this world, the closest blood relatives.

But all this changed after he met Olivia.

Olivia said she wanted to eat something good, so he forced me to cook a table full of dishes despite my serious illness.

She didn't eat, and when I couldn't help but ask, he turned on me:

"Your cooking is too bad, why are you yelling at her!"

Saying that, he threw the dishes I had worked hard to make into the garbage.

Later, Olivia and William framed me and faked her death by jumping into the sea.

Because of this, Finn hated me to the bone, severed ties with me, coldly watched me suffer all kinds of torment, and even personally pushed me into the abyss.

Thinking of this, I didn't answer his words, slowly pulling my wrist out of his hand inch by inch.

Seeing this, William immediately sneered:

"Olivia is back. She was kicked out by me with nothing, so she probably can't accept it and wants to commit suicide."

Finn frowned and laughed coldly:

"Someone as afraid of death as her, how could she really commit suicide? She's probably just putting on an act."

"Great minds think alike," William also laughed. "She just performed twice in front of me."

After mocking me, Finn looked at me with hatred again:

"Aria, even if a vicious person like you really dies, no one would care!"

"Get out of my way, don't block me from finding Olivia."

I slowly lowered my eyes: "Alright, I'll leave."

As soon as the words fell, I plunged towards the rushing river.

Finn's face turned pale.

The river was so rapid that in the blink of an eye, I had been washed ten meters away.

I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief.

This time, I should really be able to die, right?

But the next moment, with a "splash" sound, I was rescued by Finn and thrown onto the grass, covered in mud, looking miserable.

He was soaking wet and kicked me like a madman.

"Aria, are you trying to make everyone think I drove you to death and then ruin me?!"

"You really disgust me!"

"You, when did you learn to swim?" I coughed violently, bitter water spilling from the corners of my mouth.

Finn kicked me hard and sneered:

"After Olivia jumped into the sea, I learned to swim."

"What? Unhappy that your scheme didn't work?"

I couldn't help but sneer. Love is really great.

In the past, I wanted to teach him how to swim countless times.

But every time I was stopped by Olivia, "With me around, Finn doesn't need to learn to swim at all. I will always be with him and save him when he's in danger."

Finn also coldly belittled me:

"Aria, this is the difference between you and Olivia. You only force me to do things I don't want to do. You're not fit to be my sister at all!"

Later, Finn accidentally drowned, and Olivia watched coldly. It was me who went into the water and saved him.

But he thought it was Olivia who saved him, attributing all the credit to Olivia, and even scolded me for being ungrateful, watching my own brother drown without doing anything.

But I never thought that Finn, who had been afraid of water since childhood, would actually learn to swim for Olivia.

"What does my suicide have to do with you? You're nothing but a stranger to me."

Hearing this, Finn's face turned red with anger, and he slapped me.

"If it weren't for the fact that I vowed to pray and accumulate virtue for Olivia after her death, do you think I would save you, a biological sister I've severed ties with?"

"Even if it were a dog that fell into the water today, I would save it!"

I laughed self-mockingly, "What a fresh term, biological sister. Then what about Olivia? Your emotional sister? But she's going to marry William."

Hearing this, Finn suddenly dropped the cake in his hand and looked at William.

"Marriage?! With William?"

I was about to speak when another love interest, Ryan, rushed over and blurted out:

"Olivia is missing!"

"Aria, did you hide Olivia?! Quickly call her out!"
