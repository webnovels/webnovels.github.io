To save me, my twenty-five-year-old husband was thrown from a tall building by his assailants.
When he finally opened his eyes again, he was chillingly distant from me.
He claimed he was from ten years in the future, back to set everything right.
He said that at thirty-five, he would cheat on me with another woman, three years into our marriage.
He said we'd grown to despise each other long ago, but were bound together for ten years because of our child.
He said he and Ashley also had a child.
And his first demand upon returning to his twenty-five-year-old self was for me to abort our unborn twins and divorce him.

The very next morning, Liam discharged himself and brought Ashley home.
I was rushed back by his parents, only to find him holding Ashley's hand, declaring,
"Ashley is my true love. She's the only one who truly understands me, the one I'm meant to spend my life with. I have to marry her!"
"As for Chloe, I owe her. I'll compensate her after the divorce."
His parents were livid, their faces crimson with rage, sputtering that he had lost his mind.
The man who had always loved me, now so utterly devoted to another woman.
I looked at him, a bitter ache twisting in my gut.
"Liam, were you serious about what you said last night?"
He'd been in a coma for almost a month. But when he opened his eyes, he was a different man, claiming to be Liam from ten years in the future.
I thought he was disoriented, rambling nonsense because of amnesia. I hadn't believed him.
But now, he was unwavering.
Liam's gaze was as chilling as last night's. No love, no tenderness—just cold, hard indifference.
"Chloe, how many times do I have to say it? I didn't lose my memory. I remember everything. But I genuinely don't love you anymore!"
Seeing the disgust in his eyes, my heart clenched with a sharp pain.
"But we only got married three months ago! You swore you'd only ever love me…"
Liam frowned. Before he could speak, Ashley started crying.
"Chloe, I know your family is wealthier than mine, and you're the more suitable match for Liam. But he loves me now. Please, just let us be together!"
I suddenly remembered what Liam had told me last night.
He said he'd met Ashley three years in the future, when he was on duty.
He later learned that due to her impoverished background, she was exploited by wealthy men and ended up working in a club.
His concern and pity for her after that incident eventually led to them falling in love.
But by then, I had already given birth to Liam's child.
That's why our parents always refused to let us divorce.
So Liam and I were stuck together for ten years.
Eventually, Ashley, unable to cope, took her own life and her child's, jumping from the eighteenth floor.
He was back now to fix things before any of that could happen.
So he'd found Ashley ahead of time.
I sympathized with Ashley's past, but I couldn't bring myself to like her.
Liam, however, gently helped her up, his eyes full of tenderness, and warned his parents.
"Mom, Dad, if you still don't agree, I'll quit my job and end my life!"
He was using his life as leverage. His parents had no choice but to agree.
Liam immediately left with Ashley, intending to propose at her home.
After they left, Liam's parents unleashed all their anger on me.
They demanded to know why Liam had changed so drastically after waking up, why his heart had turned after only three months of marriage.
I couldn't answer.
How could I tell them…
The Liam who walked with me from campus to the altar was gone. Inside his body was the soul of his thirty-five-year-old self.
And the thirty-five-year-old Liam didn't love me.
I stumbled out of the house. The biting cold wind of early winter hit my face, yet none of this felt real.
How could Liam not love me?
When we were eighteen, we went to the same university. After an art competition, he found me, his cheeks flushed, and asked for my number.
I looked at his handsome profile, my own ears instantly burning red.
He said then, "The moment I saw you, my heart went wild."
He said, "I want to be with you forever."
We started dating when we were twenty, traveling to countless cities. In every city, he would propose to me.
He said then that he'd propose to me every year until I was a hundred, until I finally said yes.
When I was twenty-four, I was freezing to death on a snowy mountain. He piled all his clothes on me. When the rescue team found us, he was barely clinging to life, but still held me tight.
Later, I finally said yes to his proposal. He was so happy he spun me around more than a dozen times. The next day, he flew to the States to meet my parents, and at our wedding, he promised to love only me for the rest of his life.
Even when we fell from the building together, he held me close, saying, "Chloe, if there's a next life, let's be together then too."
I was unharmed, but he suffered multiple fractures.
I swore that when he woke up, I'd spend the rest of my life repaying his profound love.
But I never imagined that Liam would one day say he didn't love me!
I wiped away my tears and started walking towards Ashley's house.
I refuse to believe that Liam, who loved me so much, would cheat on me. I'll make the thirty-five-year-old Liam go back to his own body!
