1
For the New Year's holiday, the company announced a seven-day trip to the Bahamas.
When Miranda, our director, announced it, everyone was thrilled.
Everyone except me.
And just as I expected, her tone shifted.
“We’ll need someone to hold down the fort. Ryan, that’ll be you.”
She added, with a dismissive wave of her hand, “After all, you’re not managing any key projects. You’ve got the time.”
I had to laugh.
I held the grand-sounding title of General Coordinator, but it came with zero actual authority.
Yet, I was the beast of burden, the one who did the grunt work for every single project, running myself ragged day in and day out. I was the one who put in the most hours, the one who solved the most problems.
But when it came time for glory and bonuses, I was always invisible.
I had swallowed this bitterness for seven years. Today, I was done.
I pushed my chair back and stood up, my voice steady.
“No problem, Miranda. I can stay.”
“But this will be the last time.”
“I quit.”
The conference room fell into a stunned, awkward silence. Then, the whispers started, slithering through the air like snakes.
“Seriously? What’s the big deal? Is he really quitting over a vacation?” Jessica, from across the table, was the first to speak, her voice sharp and nasal. “He’s always so quiet and sullen. I never realized he was so petty.”
Mark, sitting next to her, let out a snort of derision and leaned back, kicking one leg over the other. “I think Ryan feels like his seven years of ‘hard labor’ haven’t been recognized. He’s still sore about never getting that ‘Employee of the Year’ award and this is his little protest.” He looked around the room. “Does he even know his own worth?”
From the back row, Walter, our lead tech, slowly pushed his glasses up his nose. “Ah, the fire of youth,” he said in a greasy, know-it-all tone. “Just a tantrum to scare the boss. I’ve seen this show a hundred times. He’ll come crawling back.”
“You think it’s easy to find a job out there? If he really walks, he won’t even have tears left to cry.”
“Exactly,” chimed in Kevin, who sat in the corner. He was the one who most frequently asked me to “help out” with his PowerPoints, and his voice was now the loudest, his words the most venomous.
“Miranda, don’t you dare go soft on him. We’ve all seen what he’s really done these past seven years. What is it? Printing, copying, fetching packages, ordering coffee? Has he ever actually touched a real project? If it weren’t for this company throwing him a bone, could he even survive in Port Sterling? And now he has the nerve to act all high and mighty? If you ask me, he’s just trying to blackmail you because he knows we’re swamped with projects right now!”
Every word was a poisoned dart.
I looked at Kevin. Just last week, he was scrambling to present a proposal to a major client. It was a chaotic mess of jumbled logic and incomplete data. I was the one who stayed up until 3 AM, untangling his mess, restructuring the entire thing, verifying the data, and creating clean, compelling visualizations.
He’d taken that polished presentation, wowed the client, and returned to the office beaming. He bought the entire project team celebratory drinks.
Everyone but me.
Miranda raised a hand, silencing the rising tide of accusations. Her brow was furrowed, and the look she gave me was cold, devoid of warmth, filled only with annoyance and a deep, familiar contempt.
It was the same contempt I’d seen seven years ago, when I first stepped into this office.
Back then, she held my resume, her manicured nail tapping on the line that listed my degree from a state college. “Ryan, is it? Your university isn’t exactly top-tier… but the major is relevant.”
“Tell you what,” she’d continued, “the project workload here is intense, and we require a high degree of independent skill. Given your background, let’s start you off with the basics. You won’t be assigned to a specific project. Instead, you can assist the other team members with support tasks. Get a feel for the environment. Consider it a learning experience.”
At first, I really was just the office gofer.
Running errands, delivering documents, organizing mountains of old files, even descaling the office coffee machine.
But I refused to accept that as my fate.
When others left for the day, I stayed, digging through the company server, studying every successful project file I could find. I memorized workflows, analytical methods, even the specific phrasing in final reports. Whenever I saw an opening, I’d swallow my pride and approach a busy colleague.
“Hey Mark, how did you export this data set?”
“Jessica, what’s the standard procedure for handling this kind of client feedback?”
The response was usually a dismissive wave, their eyes never leaving their screen. “You don’t need to worry about that.”
“It’s complicated. You wouldn’t get it.”
“I’m busy. Don’t bother me.”
Still, like an ant gnawing on a bone, I slowly, painstakingly pieced it all together.
Once, Jessica was rushing to finish a market analysis summary and accidentally swapped the data for two key competitors. I found the error while organizing files and, after hesitating, pointed it out to her.
Her face soured. She snatched the document from my hand. “I know! Stop being a busybody!” she snapped.
Later, the corrected report was approved. At the weekly meeting, Miranda praised her publicly. Jessica smiled like a blooming rose and never mentioned my name.

After that, things began to change, the lines blurring in a way that worked for everyone but me. “Helping out” was no longer a favor; it became my job.
When Mark was on a deadline for a proposal, full of grand ideas but empty of substance, he’d dump a chaotic pile of half-formed thoughts and research links on my desk. “Ryan, you’re decent with words. Flesh this out for me, get a first draft going.”
I’d spend my nights immersing myself in background materials, weaving his digital scraps into a coherent proposal, filling in the missing market analysis and outlining concrete steps for implementation. After I handed it over, he’d make a few cosmetic tweaks and submit it as his “masterpiece,” earning praise from the client for his blend of creativity and practicality.
When Walter hit a technical snag, he wouldn’t even ask. He’d just walk over, drop his laptop on my desk, and say, “Kid, this code’s busted. Take a look for me, will you? I’ve got a meeting.”
I wasn’t a programmer, but I’d taught myself enough to get by, relying on patience and endless online searches. I’d spend hours debugging his mess. When I finally fixed it, he’d just pat me on the shoulder. “Not bad, kid. Guess you’re good for something after all.”
And Kevin’s presentations were a constant disaster zone I was expected to salvage.
“Ryan, this PowerPoint is hideous. You’ve got a good eye, make it pretty.”
“Ryan, the boss says this report is confusing. Make it idiot-proof. I need it by tomorrow.”
“Ryan, this data is a mess. I need charts. Make them look good, make them convincing.”
His requests were always urgent, difficult, and vague.
And somehow, I always delivered.
Thanks to the polished, crystal-clear reports I created for him, he cultivated a reputation with management as a “strategic thinker with outstanding communication skills.”
The cruelest irony was that when these projects succeeded, when the bonuses were handed out and the celebration dinners were planned, I was always on the outside looking in. They’d congratulate each other, laughing about where to go for drinks. Occasionally, someone might glance my way and offer a perfunctory, “Ryan worked hard, too.”
And that was it. My name never appeared on a bonus list. My hard work was worth nothing more than a cheap, throwaway compliment.
Miranda wasn’t blind.
A few times, leaving late, she’d see the light still on at my desk, saw the scattered documents from three different projects I was juggling. She’d just offer a bland platitude. “It’s good for young people to work hard.”
As for promotions or raises, those were distant dreams that had nothing to do with me. The best they did was give me that empty “General Coordinator” title as a pacifier.
A fancy name for the office mule.
“Ryan!”
Miranda’s sharp, impatient voice yanked me from my thoughts.
“If you have a problem, you can raise it through the proper channels. There’s no need to resort to threats of resignation. You should ask yourself, honestly, has this company ever been unfair to you in these seven years? We didn’t look down on your degree. We gave you a platform, a chance to learn. And now you’re throwing a tantrum over a vacation? Isn’t that incredibly immature? And irresponsible?”
“Miranda’s right!” Jessica, ever the sycophant, chimed in immediately. “Ryan, the company invested seven years in you! Don’t you have any gratitude? Staying behind is also part of the job. Or should the whole company just shut down so everyone can go on vacation? You’re being incredibly selfish!”
Kevin added with a sneer, “I think he just can’t handle the pressure and is looking for an excuse to run away. If you actually gave him a real project to lead, he’d screw it up for sure. Don’t fall for his bluff, Miranda. He knows he’s been coasting for seven years and can’t keep it up anymore, so he’s going scorched earth.”
Mark joined the chorus. “Come on, Ryan, don’t be like that. We’re a team. We help each other out. That’s how it works. Take some advice, man. Don’t be impulsive. Apologize to Miranda, do your part, and focus on your work from now on.”
They went on, one after another.
The projects that had been built on my sweat and sleepless nights were now credited to the “platform the company provided.”
My countless nights of overtime were twisted into evidence of me “coasting.”
My patience and sacrifice had become the foundation for their condescending “advice.”
Looking at their familiar, deceitful faces, at Miranda’s impatient scowl, the fire that had been smoldering in my chest for seven years finally burned out, leaving only cold ash.
I stood up again, my spine ramrod straight.
“Miranda, everyone, thank you for your kind words and guidance.”
My voice was calm, almost conversational. “In these seven years, let’s see… I’ve printed countless documents, fetched endless packages, ordered gallons of coffee, salvaged dozens of proposals, debugged lines of code I didn’t write, polished hundreds of terrible PowerPoints, and turned mountains of incoherent data into reports that a child could understand…”
“But you’re right. None of that really counts. It was all just my duty. I was just ‘coasting.’”
“And I’m certainly not worthy of a trip to the Bahamas.”
“So, I don’t need any more ‘learning experiences.’ I don’t need any more ‘training.’”
“My resignation isn’t a threat. It’s a notice.”
“I will stay for the one-month transition period, as required. As for what I’ll be transitioning…” I paused, my gaze sweeping across their faces. “I’m sorry, but I’ll only be handing over the duties officially listed in my job description.”
“As for all those files on your computers… the ones I created but that happen to have your names on them… the data, the proposals, the code, the PowerPoints…”
“Good luck. I truly hope they continue to serve you well without me.”
“And finally,” I looked directly at Miranda, a faint, humorless smile on my lips, “thank you for the seven years of ‘blessings’ you’ve given me.”
“Unfortunately, I’m not blessed enough to receive them.”

With that, I pulled open the conference room door and walked out.
That afternoon, I submitted my resignation letter to HR and sent a company-wide email.
“Effective immediately, I will only be performing duties as outlined in my job description. Please refrain from contacting me regarding other matters. Thank you.”
Less than a minute after the email went out, the office began to buzz like a disturbed hornet’s nest.
From my desk, I could hear Jessica’s strained whisper, “Wow. He really thinks he’s hot stuff now.”
Mark let out a loud scoff, the sound of his typing suddenly more aggressive. “Let him have his little drama. See how long it lasts.”
“His grand title of ‘General Coordinator’ really just means he’s in charge of getting us coffee and printing our documents,” he added. “The second he walks out that door, he’s nothing.”
Kevin leaned over to a colleague, his voice just loud enough to carry. “All ego, no talent. Just wait. He’ll be begging Miranda for his job back in a couple of days.”
I put on my headphones, cranked up the music, and blocked them out.
Then, I opened a folder on my computer named “Support Files.”
Inside, meticulously organized, was every single thing I had created for every person and every project over the last seven years.
I selected the entire folder, hit Shift+Delete, and confirmed.
Then I emptied the recycling bin.
The whole process took less than ten seconds, but it felt like a seven-year weight had been lifted from my chest.
At five o’clock, the end-of-day bell chimed.
Under the surprised gazes of my colleagues, I shut down my computer, grabbed my bag, and became the first person to walk out of the office.
It was the first time in seven years I hadn’t worked late.
Stepping outside, the evening air was cool, carrying a strange, sweet scent of freedom.
Around 9 PM, my phone rang. It was Jessica.
The moment I answered, she launched in. “Ryan, what’s the status of the proposal for the new project? Miranda wants to see it first thing tomorrow. The client is pushing hard, so send it to me now!”
Her tone was completely matter-of-fact, laced with an impatient urgency, as if my email from that afternoon had never existed.
“Jessica,” I replied calmly, “that proposal is your responsibility. I don’t have the authority or the knowledge to work on it. I’m just a gofer, remember? This has nothing to do with me.”
She was clearly thrown off. After a two-second pause, her voice shot up an octave. “Ryan, what the hell is that supposed to mean?! You’ve always handled this stuff before! Are you playing dumb with me now? Just send the file and stop wasting my time!”
“Helping you before was a favor. Sticking to my duties now is my job.” My voice was flat. “I’m busy. I have a show to watch. Goodbye.”
“Ryan, don’t you dare hang up on me! You—”
Her furious shouts were cut off by the dial tone.
I put my phone down and switched it to silent.
The next day, things got interesting.
First, Kevin came by, holding a messy Excel spreadsheet. He dropped it on the corner of my desk out of habit. “Ryan, I need data charts for this. The meeting is this afternoon. You know the drill, make them look sharp.”
I didn’t even glance at the spreadsheet. I simply pushed it back toward him.
“Kevin, data analysis is a part of your report. It’s your responsibility, not mine. I can’t do it.”
His face tightened, and for a second, I thought he was going to explode. But with others watching, he forced a grotesque smile. “Come on, man, help me out. We go way back. I’m just totally swamped.”
“Sorry,” I said, looking back at my own work. “So am I.”
He stood there for a moment, fuming, before snatching the spreadsheet back. As he turned away, I heard him mutter, “Asshole.”
Next up was Walter.
He lumbered over with his laptop, pointing at an error message. “Kid, this script is crashing again. Take a look for me? It’s similar to that last problem.”
I shook my head. “Sorry, Walter, I can’t solve technical issues. I’m not tech support.”
He pushed his glasses up, his tone carrying its usual weight of command. “Just a quick look. It won’t take you five minutes. I have to get to a meeting.”
“I really can’t help you,” I insisted, meeting his gaze evenly.
He opened his mouth, then closed it. Without another word, he turned and walked away, grumbling, “What’s wrong with kids these days? No sense of teamwork at all.”

The morning’s relative peace was shattered just before lunch.
A major client, one of Mark’s, suddenly demanded to see a preliminary draft of a proposal that wasn’t due until the following week. They wanted it by the end of the day.
He was clearly unprepared. I watched him frantically rifle through files at his desk, his face growing paler by the second.
Finally, he stormed over to my desk and slammed his fist down on the surface. The impact made my pen holder jump.
“Ryan! What the hell is your problem?!” he roared, loud enough for the entire office to hear. “All the notes and background materials for that proposal are with you! Get it done now! Do you have any idea what will happen if we lose this client? Can you handle that responsibility?!”
Every eye in the office turned to us, a mix of morbid curiosity and undisguised glee.
I slowly lifted my head.
“Mark,” I said, my voice quiet but clear. “That proposal is your project. You’ve been the lead from planning to client communication. I don’t have any of the relevant files.”
“As for responsibility…” I paused for effect. “The person in charge of the project bears the consequences. Isn’t that how it works?”
“That’s bullshit!” he snarled, his finger jabbing toward my face. “Every other time, I came up with the idea and you fleshed it out! And now you’re playing games with me? I’m telling you, if that proposal doesn’t get done today, you’re going down with me!”
“I was helping,” I corrected him. “That was never my job. And now, please stop distracting me from mine.”
I turned back to my computer screen, dismissing him completely.
Mark stood there, breathing heavily, his eyes boring into the back of my head. After a long moment, he spun around and stormed out, heading straight for the director’s office.
Less than ten minutes later, my desk phone rang. It was Miranda’s assistant, her voice like ice.
“Ryan, Miranda wants to see you in her office. Now.”
So, it had come to this.
I smoothed my shirt collar and, under the scrutiny of dozens of pairs of eyes, walked toward the corner office at the end of the hall.
When I entered, Miranda was sitting behind her massive desk, her face a mask of thunder. Mark stood beside her, arms crossed, a smug, “you’re-so-screwed” look on his face.
“Ryan! What is the meaning of this?!” Miranda slammed her palm on the desk, her voice sharp with fury. “Why aren’t you assisting Mark? Don’t you know how urgent the client’s request is? This account is worth millions! If we lose it because of your refusal to cooperate, can you bear that responsibility?!”
The questions came like machine-gun fire, each one aimed to paint me as the source of all this chaos.
I waited quietly until she was finished.
Then, I smiled.
It was a small smile, but in the tense silence of the room, it was impossible to miss.
“Miranda,” I began, my tone deceptively calm.
“Yesterday, in that meeting, you said yourself that I don’t manage any key projects and that I usually have plenty of free time.”
“How is it that today, the responsibility for a multi-million-dollar account has suddenly landed on the shoulders of the ‘idlest person’ in the company?”
“That’s a heavy burden, Miranda. I’m afraid I’m not qualified to carry it.”
Miranda’s expression froze, as if she’d been slapped. Her mouth opened, then closed. For a split second, she was at a complete loss for words. I had used her own logic, her own dismissive words, and turned them into an unbreakable shield.
Mark, standing beside her, grew frantic. “See, Miranda? Look at his attitude! He’s just sabotaging us!”
“He’s the General Coordinator of the department!”
I chuckled. “My job as General Coordinator has always been to make coffee, order takeout, and print documents for you. Weren’t those your own words?”
Miranda’s face flushed from pale to crimson, a sure sign that embarrassment was giving way to pure rage. She had probably never been contradicted like this, especially not by someone she considered a disposable nobody.
After a moment of stunned silence, her fury erupted.
“Ryan!” she shrieked. “How dare you! This company has employed you for seven years, and this is how you speak to your superiors?! If you don’t want to work, then get out!”
“Get out of my company right now! And you can forget about your final paycheck and any bonuses!”
“Don’t think for a second that we can’t survive without you!”
I nodded, even managing a small, placid smile at her incandescent rage.
“Thank you, Miranda.”
