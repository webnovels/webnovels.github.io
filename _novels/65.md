Rocky Mountains expedition met with severe weather.

In a life-and-death situation, my boyfriend Nolan and my best friend Adeline took my gear and supplies, leaving me to survive on my own.

Just when I was isolated and desperate, Adeline's uncle Asher arrived by helicopter to save me.

My frostbitten fingers required amputation, and he tenderly cared for me as I healed.

As we spent time together, our connection deepened, leading to marriage.

In the fourth year of our marriage, I unexpectedly overheard a conversation between Asher and his Trusted Assistant.

"Keep investigating if Madam has any evidence against Adeline."

"Mr. Fu, Madam has been in the Fu family for a long time now; she even has a child. Miss Adeline is already the Orchestra's Principal Violinist. Do we still need to be cautious of her?"

"Of course, marrying her was to prevent the Rocky Mountains incident from coming to light. I've put up with those amputated fingers of hers for so long, I can't afford to slip up."

Asher's expression was one of tenderness I had never seen before:

"I absolutely cannot let Adeline face any risk of disgrace. Even if the world disapproves, I will protect her for life."
