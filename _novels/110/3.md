The dark and damp room was really not suitable for living.

Even though I cleaned it three times a day and used all sorts of effective pest control products, she always had some bug bites on her.

Her fair skin was covered in red, swollen marks, with blood faintly visible beneath.

I advised her:

"How about you sleep with me at night?"

"Staying in the employee dorm, you're still being punished."

She was obviously tempted, but she stubbornly shook her head:

"No, I have to let mom calm down."

"If I go to you, mom might think I'm disobedient."

Just then, Mrs. Johnson passed by, clicking her tongue disdainfully: "If she's so obedient, why does she always anger her mom and hit her brother?"

The little girl bit her lip, a look of grievance appearing on her face.

Just as anger appeared on her face, I quickly scolded Mrs. Johnson:

"Mrs. Johnson, we're just workers here; it's not our place to meddle in the family's affairs, right?"

"Mr. and Mrs. don't like us pointing fingers at their family matters, do they?"

Mrs. Johnson snorted from her nose and swayed away.

I turned back to the little girl, seeing her eyebrows knitted together, tears welling up in her eyes.

"I really want to listen to mom."

"But I really, really don't want to..."

I hugged her, holding her tightly, telling her:

"You did nothing wrong."

"My young lady is a very obedient and well-behaved child."

"It's them who are unfair, always forcing you to give up your rights."

Her actions were indeed excessive.

But a little girl, not wanting her brother in her room, had to resort to burning the room.

She had to use the threat of strangling her brother to gain the right to share food equally.

The ones at fault are clearly the parents.

I'm just a housekeeper and can't possibly criticize my employers.

I can only do my best to make her life better.

Decorating her room.

Changing her night light to the cutest little rabbit.

Placing jasmine flowers so she can sleep with the fragrance...

Thunder roared in the middle of the night, and the temperature plummeted.

Awoken by the noise, I saw a shadowy figure in the room.

I screamed in fright.

The figure screamed too.

I turned on the night light.

The little girl was holding a pillow, looking at me, wearing a thin nightgown, her face pale from the cold.

I quickly got up, pulled her into bed, and wrapped her tightly in the blanket:

"What's wrong?"

"Why didn't you wear a coat? What if you catch a cold?"

I couldn't help but scold her.

She sniffled and told me:

"The noise is so loud, I'm scared."

Place some jasmine flowers by her bed so she can fall asleep with their comforting fragrance...

In the middle of the night, thunder roared, and the temperature plummeted.

The noise woke me up, and I saw a dark figure in the room.

Startled, I screamed.

The figure screamed as well.
