Her little scheme, naturally, didn't succeed.

Besides me, the surveillance cameras captured everything clearly.

The young lady was fighting with her brother over something, couldn't get her way, and ended up falling down the stairs herself.

As a result, her mother, my employer, left her in the hospital without even visiting.

The other maids in the house, disliking her behavior, pushed the responsibility of caring for her onto me.

I hadn't even moved into my dormitory yet and was already staying at the hospital.

She cried from evening until morning, making my head throb.

I wanted to give up, but my financial situation said otherwise.

If I left now, finding another job as good as this one would be impossible.

Free meals and lodging with a good salary.

At least, at least I should stay until my debts are paid off.

I had to figure out a way to mingle with the other maids and gather some information.

"I've never seen such a troublesome child. When her brother enters her room, she burns it down to blame him."

"Her dad brought cookies from abroad, and when her brother unknowingly ate them first, she almost strangled him."

"She can't stand it when her parents praise her brother. Whenever they do, she hits him."

"Back in our hometown, a girl like that would have been dealt with harshly."

These comments made me uncomfortable.

Suddenly, a voice came from behind me:

"So what if I'm that vicious person?"

I was so startled that I dropped my phone and turned around to find her standing behind me, eyes swollen from crying and glaring at me.

She tried to kick me:

"You, a mere servant, dare to gossip about me behind my back."

"Believe it or not, I can have you fired."

I managed to dodge her kick just in time.

But she slipped and fell.

Suddenly, her cries were deafening. I quickly helped her up, holding her gently to calm her down.

I thought she'd make an even bigger scene.

But she calmed down unexpectedly.

I looked down in surprise to see her snuggling in my arms, looking very docile.

When she noticed my gaze, she looked up and met my eyes.

She immediately looked down.

Then she reacted and shouted fiercely at me:

"What are you looking at?"

"Believe it or not, I'll gouge your eyes out."

Why is such a young girl learning lines from TV shows?

I found it a bit amusing and carried her back to the ward, pressing the call button to get a doctor to check her.

The good news was she wasn't seriously hurt.

The bad news was she claimed to be in pain and insisted I massage her, or she'd report it to the family.

When Mrs. Taylor came to deliver food, she saw me massaging her leg.

My hands were sore, alternating between my left and right hands.

One hand massaging, the other shaking.

Mrs. Taylor set the food down and gave me a look.

I made an excuse to wash the dishes and met Mrs. Taylor outside.

Mrs. Taylor immediately said with a disdainful expression:

"If you hold her like this now, she'll make a fuss if you don't hold her next time."

I found it a bit strange.

But I didn't agree with Mrs. Taylor, just gently refuted:

"Kids need affection, right?"
