"That's wonderful, you're finally starting to recover!"
"You used to always say your hands were useless, that you didn't want to be my burden and wanted a divorce. Let's see if you still dare say such discouraging things now!"
She excitedly found a hot water bottle to warm my hands, then gently massaged them.
She looked as happy as a wife seeing her husband recover. But I could no longer trust her.
I forced a smile and pushed Chloe away from me. "Don't you have to go to your part-time job? Hurry along, don't be late for work."
She paused at my unusual reaction, but after carefully checking that I seemed normal, she just kissed me on the cheek and hurried out the door. "Wait for me at home!"
Shortly after she left, I went out too.
I had been holding my son's ashes before being knocked unconscious. Now they were gone, presumably left at the hotel. I needed to find them.
But I had only walked a few steps when I suddenly felt dizzy.
When I opened my eyes again, it was pain that woke me.
Someone had viciously struck my wrist with a club. Agonizing pain spread throughout my body.
In the darkness, I couldn't make out the attacker's face. I only heard him speaking into a phone in a thick accent.
"Ms. Chloe, I've crippled that man's hand. This time I guarantee he'll never be able to lift it again."
"We were very discreet. We didn't let him see our faces."
A cold female voice came through the phone, devoid of emotion. "Last time you guaranteed the same thing, yet he was able to lift his arm again after just three years. Are you certain it's completely ruined this time? I want to ensure he has no chance of recovery ever again!"
After getting confirmation, Chloe finally sounded satisfied.
"Very good. I'll double your payment!"
"I've drugged his water with enough sedatives to last all day. Just leave him there barely breathing. I'll go deal with him after I finish up things with Marcus."
My heart was pounding with shock.
I was already crippled, yet Chloe still wasn't satisfied. She was willing to go to such lengths to destroy me for Marcus!
But for all her calculations, she never anticipated that I had only taken one sip of that water.
After the man hung up, he turned to give my hand another blow.
I seized the opportunity to strangle him unconscious with the iron chains on the ground, then staggered out.
Once outside the room, I realized this was the underground warehouse of Lin Corporation. Just as I was about to leave, I saw two people talking in the garden.
Chloe was leaning against Marcus, her head buried in his chest, seemingly full of endless affection.
She sighed, "Marcus, your embrace is so warm. I wish I could stay in your arms forever. If only this moment would never end."
"I'm in so much agony. Countless times I've wanted to divorce Jack, but I'm afraid that once we divorce, he'll be out of my control and pose a threat to you."
"For the sake of him once saving you, I can only grit my teeth and care for that cripple."
Marcus didn't push her away, but instead wrapped his arm around her waist.
He sighed, "You've suffered so much for me, Chloe. I'll always remember everything you've done."
"But I set my life's goal long ago to focus on my career. If I can't achieve great success, I'm afraid I'll regret it for the rest of my life."
"I'm about to negotiate a deal with a major corporation. I heard their CEO has a grudge against Jack. What if I hand Jack over to him? Wouldn't that help seal the deal? I just don't know if you'd be willing..."
Chloe replied without hesitation, "Of course I'm willing. Just tell me when you need him. Back when my family went bankrupt, it was you who gave me a billion dollars to help. Otherwise, Lin Corporation wouldn't be where it is today."
She paused, then added, "Just... no matter what they do to him, make sure to leave him alive in the end."
"You can't bear to let him die?" Marcus asked.
"No, it's because his blood type and bone marrow match yours. In case anything happens to you, he can donate blood or organs."
I laughed coldly.
So Chloe believed that billion-dollar investment came from Marcus.
No wonder she was so obedient to him, treating him like her savior.
I wondered how she would react if she knew the truth.
I took out my phone and dialed a number I hadn't called in years.
"Dad, I'm done being stubborn. I admit I was wrong."
"I'll agree to your demand to divorce Chloe. Please send someone to pick me up and bring me home."
After hanging up, I prepared to leave.
But just as I exited the company, I ran into Marcus.
He stood with his arms crossed, looking at me with a mocking expression.
"Did you enjoy eavesdropping? The once high and mighty Jack, how have you fallen to such a pathetic state? Covered in blood, thin as a rail. Didn't eat the gourmet meal I specially prepared for you?"
My clothes were stained with blood from the attack, and I looked utterly disheveled.
My wrist throbbed with pain at the slightest movement. I could only be grateful I had stopped that man from striking a second time, or my hand might truly have been beyond saving.
I didn't want to engage with this ungrateful bastard. I just gave him a cold look and prepared to leave.
But Marcus pulled out a small urn, dangling it before me.
"Looking for this?" he asked.
