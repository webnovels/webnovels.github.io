Seven years into my marriage with Julian Thorne,

I discovered he had a seven-year-old child.

And I wasn’t the mother.

"Ma'am, we can't process this child's official registration."

I froze.

"What do you mean? My husband and I only have this one child, our baby!"

The clerk double-checked, her expression turning rather knowing.

"You certainly only have this one child. But Mr. Thorne isn't… single."

"He has another seven-year-old son. His mother's name is Seraphina Cross. Do you know her?"

I was stunned, a faint twitch at the corner of my mouth.

Seraphina Cross?

Of course, I knew her.

Julian and I were practically destined for each other, childhood sweethearts from families that had always approved of our match.

And Seraphina Cross?

She was the cheap bar hostess Julian had a one-night stand with, that one time we had a huge fight, and he went out to drown his sorrows.

The moment I stepped out of the registration office,

I called my childhood best friend.

"Time for a new dad for my kid. Are you in?"
