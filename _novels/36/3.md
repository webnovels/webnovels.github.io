A flicker of guilt flashes in Ryan's eyes as he pulls away from Amber's clinging arms.
"Don't worry, honey. I'll take you to the doctor right away."
But Amber refuses to let go, pressing herself against him again:
"Don't go, Ryan. I'm so cold, hold me! She's clearly acting, don't believe her!"
Ryan roughly yanks Amber's arm off him, tossing her onto the bed:
"Get off me! Don't tell me what to do! If anything happens to my wife, you'll be in big trouble!"
Amber doesn't give up. She switches to an even more alluring pose, showcasing her body's softness to the fullest. Her tone is seductive:
"Ryan, can't you smell it? That's clearly chicken blood!"
"How could a healthy person cough up so much blood? Look how lively your wife seems. She must have held the blood in her mouth beforehand!"
Ryan's expression turns doubtful. His steps towards me come to a halt.
"She's even using the 'playing dead' trick to compete for attention. Look, she's even put on 'seriously ill' makeup!"
"Not content with being the first wife, she's getting a bit greedy..."
Ryan's body, which had tensed up from nervousness, completely relaxes. He stands in place, carelessly looking me over.
After a long moment, his face twists with intense disgust. He picks up the trash can by the bed and dumps its contents over my face.
"You want to compete for attention? Then open your eyes wide and see clearly who can truly bring out the joy of being a man!"
"The stuff at home that was about to expire - Amber and I used it all up this afternoon!"
"Please... you... hospital..." I beg.
He can't be bothered to look at me as I struggle on the brink of death, pleading desperately. He flips the trash can over my head, his tone ice-cold.
"Give it up. Stop acting. You've been exposed. There's no point in continuing this performance!"
"Amber understands you lonely, bitter old women best!"
Amber, feeling validated, cheers excitedly in her coquettish voice:
"Of course I do! I've watched so many palace dramas, I know all about these troublemaking old women!"
With the heavy trash can over my head, I can barely breathe. I bite my tongue to maintain my last shred of clarity:
"Save me, I'm really dying. Call 911..."
Amber lets out a shrill scream.
"I know this one! The next act is 'diagnosed with terminal illness'!"
"Tsk tsk, sis, where did you take your acting classes? That tuition was well spent!"
"But have you considered how much money Ryan could be losing? He makes millions in deals every minute. You're being so inconsiderate!"
The stench of the couple's lovemaking from inside the trash can assaults my senses, jolting me awake.
It's better to rely on myself than others.
Using my last ounce of strength, I shake off the trash can and crawl towards the door on trembling hands.
The security guards patrol regularly. If I can just get outside, I have a chance of being rescued.
Behind me, Amber's mocking voice rings out loudly.
"Ryan, your wife is really going all out. She's really selling this 'struggle for life' act."
"It's a shame about this fine hardwood floor though. She's making such a mess, it'll definitely leave marks."
My whole body is shaking, every cell trembling. Tears and sweat mingle, stinging my eyes fiercely.
I ignore Amber's sarcasm and finally reach the door.
With great effort, I raise my hand to reach for the doorknob. Again and again I try, I don't know how many times, until I finally grasp it.
But the door doesn't open. Ryan violently swats my hand away.
"If your brain's not working right, hurry up and go see a doctor. No one has time to watch you act out this sob story!"
It feels like millions of insects are gnawing at my body. I clench my fists tightly, my palms bleeding.
"I'm really sick, I feel terrible. Let me go to the hospital myself, I promise I won't bother you!"
The immense psychological trauma combined with extreme pain makes me feel like I'm seeing two figures, one black and one white.
No, I can't die now. I still have so many unfulfilled wishes.
In this desperate situation, I can only play along, swallowing my pride and begging:
"Please open the door. I'll go to the hospital myself, I really won't cause you any trouble..."
Ryan looks at the blood smeared on his calf with disgust and kicks me hard.
I've completely lost all my strength. I can only lie on the cold floor, feeling my heartbeat grow weaker and weaker.
Ryan grabs my hair and drags me towards the door without a care.
