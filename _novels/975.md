Quinley Clark's mother accidentally brushed against the custom-made gown of the richest heiress, and someone had her limbs broken before throwing her into the sea, leaving her to die.

On the day Quinley took the arrogant heiress to court, the other woman was declared not guilty.

This was because the lawyer defending her was Gary White, the founder of the most untouchable law firm in Juleern, who was also Quinley's husband.

At the end of the trial, the handsome and dignified man stepped down from the defendant's seat and placed a letter of "apology" in front of Quinley.

"Quinn, sign it. You wouldn't want to be sued for defamation and end up in prison, would you?"

His tone was gentle and persuasive, but the look behind his gold-rimmed glasses was sharp and icy.

With stubborn, tear-filled eyes, Quinley looked at him, her voice trembling. "Why, Gary?"

She couldn't understand.

Quinley was Gary's wife. She was the one he loved so much that even when he gave up his family fortune and was held captive by his family, he still insisted on marrying her, a mere maid.

But after her mother's death, Quinley pleaded with Gary through tears over and over again. Just this morning, for the 99th time, she dropped to her knees at his feet, threatening divorce if he wouldn't drop the case.

But what did he say? "Quinn, don't force me!"

Gary irritably loosened his tie. "Luna is different. She pursued me for ten years and even saved my life. I have to protect her, even if the enemy is my most beloved wife."

As he spoke, he opened the tablet in his hand and displayed a live stream for Quinley.

"You have two minutes to think, Quinn. Even if you don't think of yourself, think of Mom. Sign it, and I'll return her ashes to you."

On the screen, there was a scene at sea. Several bodyguards were holding a sandalwood urn.

If they let go…

Quinley's tears immediately fell. "What are you going to do?"

There was no change in expression on Gary's face at all. "Be good and don't waste time. Can you bear to let Mom stay in the sea forever?"

"Gary!" Quinley stared at the man in front of her, biting her lip almost to the point of bleeding. "I want a divorce."

But in the cruel confrontation, he remained utterly calm. "Quinn, you have only 30 seconds left."

At that moment, Quinley felt as if someone had pierced her heart with a needle.

How ironic. This man had once loved her as though she were life itself.

Eight years ago, he fell in love with her at first sight at the White estate. She used to be the caregiver of Noah White, Gary's grandfather.

Their statuses were worlds apart, yet he confessed to her a hundred times.

She only ever needed to glance at a bellflower, and Gary would have all the roses in the garden replaced overnight.

When she accidentally twisted her ankle, he would book an entire hospital floor just for her.

It was also during that time that she learned he had a pursuer. She was Luna Scott, Gary's childhood friend and the heiress of the wealthiest family. She had chased after him for years, loving him to the point of life and death.

But in Gary's eyes, there was no one else.

"Quinn, I only love you. So what if Luna and I are a perfect match on paper? I feel nothing but disgust for her!"

In order to force him to give up, the White family not only took back his shares but even pulled strings to have him sent away to a remote island abroad.

For 20 days, Gary went on a hunger strike to force the outside world to compromise. In doing so, he won Quinley's heart completely.

Just like that, they got married, and he truly did love her like his life, just as he had promised.

The turning point came six months ago, when Luna, who had been away for years, suddenly returned to the country. This time, Gary's attitude toward her changed abruptly.

He canceled international meetings to pick up Luna at the airport personally. He even stayed away from home for three days to organize a welcome-back banquet for Luna.

Facing Quinley's aggrieved gaze, Gary told the truth. "A year ago, when I was in Engrelle, I got into a car accident. Luna fell into a coma for a whole year trying to save me. Quinn, I still only love you. But she just woke up, and I have to repay this debt. Just give me one year, okay?"

At first, Quinley believed him.

But on the night of the banquet, her old illness suddenly flared up. Quinley was rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment, and no matter how many times she called Gary, he never picked up.

With no other option, her mother went to the luxurious yacht where the banquet was being held. However, she never came back.

Everyone insisted it was an accident and that her mother had died by suicide.

Even Gary, who happened to be away from the scene when it happened, believed that version of events.

That night, after Quinley was wheeled out of the emergency room, she received a phone call. On the other end, she heard chaos—Luna's scolding voice and Quinley's mother's agonizing screams.

Her mother hadn't fallen into the sea by accident. She had been forced.

For the past six months, Quinley had lived in anguish and guilt, crying herself to sleep every night. In her breakdown, she finally uncovered a clue from a waiter's lips.

She had begged Gary countless times to help her.

But in this criminal private prosecution trial, he stood firmly on the opposing side without the slightest hesitation.

He protected the one who had killed her mother, and in order to force her to admit fault, he even used her mother's ashes as leverage.

At this moment, as Quinley looked at Gary in front of her, she didn't recognize him. She felt as though he came from hell.

She gave up hope and accepted her fate. With trembling fingers, she signed crookedly on the letter.

"Happy now? Tell them to bring the ashes back."

Just as her hoarse voice fell, a sudden cry rang out behind her.

Luna suddenly clutched her head and collapsed on the defendant's bench. "Gary, help me! My head hurts again!"

Gary instantly panicked as he dropped the tablet, rushing toward Luna.

On the livestream, the countdown had already ended. Without receiving an order to stop, the bodyguards began opening the urn.

"No! I've signed the letter! Gary, tell them to stop!"

Quinley screamed like mad, but the bodyguards wouldn't listen to her commands.

She tried to lunge at Gary and grab him, but all he cared about was Luna.

As he carried Luna out, his elbow slammed into Quinley hard.

She fell heavily to the ground, her forehead hitting the edge of the table. Tears fell onto the tablet one after another.

It was all too late.

She saw the ashes being poured from the boat. Carried by the cold sea wind, they slowly vanished into the rising waves.

Heart-wrenching guilt tore through Quinley's heart.

Her mother had always feared the cold. She hated the ocean the most. Now, not only had she died there, but she would remain trapped in that sea forever.

Quinley broke down completely. "I'm sorry, Mom."

Suddenly, she regretted everything. She regretted falling in love with Gary and marrying him.

Endless remorse consumed her, making her feel dizzy. The world before her eyes blurred.

In the dimming frame of her vision, she could only hear Gary's anxious voice outside the courtroom.

"Luna, hang in there! As long as you're okay, I'll give you anything you want!"
