I had given the company fifteen years, building the European market from a blank slate.
On the new CEO’s first day, he publicly shredded my contract: Forty-year-old deadwood. Salary slashed from fifty thousand to fifteen thousand a month. Take it or quit.
I signed it.
He then turned to the executive board meeting and asked, “Who will manage the two-billion-dollar European portfolio?”
The conference room fell into a deathly silence.
I stood up. “Three days from now, our competition will tell you.”
His face went white.

1
It was eight in the morning, and I was walking into the office tower with a cup of scalding Americano.
The young receptionist, fresh out of college, caught my eye, and her gaze flickered away. Her lips parted as if to speak, but she swallowed the words, looking uncomfortable.
A tight, cold knot formed in my stomach. A sense of foreboding, like a damp, chilling fog, silently rolled in.
The internal line on my desk shrieked the moment I set down my coffee. It was HR, summoning all management above the mid-level to an immediate meeting in the top-floor conference room.
The air conditioning was set impossibly low in the room, making my skin prickle with cold.
Blaine Harrison, the newly appointed CEO, was already seated at the head of the long mahogany table. He was in his early thirties, impeccably dressed in a bespoke suit, his hair slicked back without a single strand out of place. The look he gave everyone was one of unconcealed condescension.
He cleared his throat and immediately cut to the chase, announcing a radical restructuring of the company. Then, his voice shifted, suddenly sharp and loud.
“In particular, we need to clean house. We have to purge the dead weight—those entrenched, underperforming senior staff who are clinging to high salaries, becoming a drain on our growth.”
The moment the words landed, dozens of eyes subtly drifted toward me.
The Head of HR was sweating profusely, looking like a nervous executioner about to carry out a distasteful duty. He shakily opened a file and began reading the list of salary reductions.
After a string of names, my own was spat out clearly: “Elias Vic, Director of Global Operations. Monthly salary adjusted from fifty thousand to fifteen thousand.”
A seventy percent cut.
The entire conference room went silent, so quiet you could hear the hiss of the central air. It felt like a massive vacuum had sealed us all in, crushing the air from the room.
Dozens of gazes—some pitying, some gleeful, some aghast—pierced me like a flurry of fine needles.
I gripped the glass of ice water in front of me, my knuckles turning a shocking white from the sheer force of my hold.
Blaine leaned back in his chair, a cold, mocking smirk playing on his lips. He looked directly at me, his words slow, deliberate, and designed to sting.
“Forty years old, and you expect to command a salary like that? Mr. Vic, is this a corporation or a retirement home?”
“If you have an issue with this, Director Vic, you’re welcome to pack your desk and leave right now.”
I took a deep breath. The icy air burned my lungs, bringing on a sharp, fierce ache.
My mind raced, flashing through the cinematic reel of the last fifteen years.
Dragging my suitcase through unfamiliar streets late at night in a foreign country, all to open up a non-existent European market.
Drinking until my stomach bled at a negotiation dinner to seal a deal with a notoriously difficult client.
The family holidays I missed. The New Year’s Eves spent in airplane seats. The grey hairs that had mysteriously appeared at my temples. All of it converged into a surge of scalding resentment that threatened to choke me.
My assistant, Cathy, who was seated a few rows back, shot up abruptly. Her cheeks were flushed crimson, and her lips were trembling—she was clearly about to leap to my defense.
I lifted my eyes and silenced her with a single, uncompromising look.
Arguing with a person like Blaine was a guaranteed path to self-humiliation.
I rose slowly, pulling my chair back. The action was small, but the sound of the chair on the floor echoed sharply in the oppressive silence.
“Where is the new salary agreement?” My voice was unnervingly calm, even to my own ears. “I’ll sign it.”
A collective gasp swept through the room.
Blaine was clearly thrown by my immediate compliance. He hesitated for a beat, then a look of smug victory spread across his face as he pushed a document toward me.
I took the pen and, without a moment of indecision, scrawled my name, Elias Vic, across the signature line.
The force I used was so great it nearly tore the thin paper.
Having signed, I tossed the pen down and turned to walk away from this sickening scene.
“Wait.”
Blaine’s voice barked out from behind me.
I didn't turn back.
He sounded slightly frantic now, his urgency cutting through his arrogance. “Who will handle the two-billion-dollar European portfolio going forward?”
A strange, heavy silence descended upon the meeting room again.
The executives exchanged nervous glances. No one dared to speak.
I could feel the color draining, little by little, from Blaine’s youthful, cocky face.

I finally stopped and slowly turned around. I met Blaine’s now-pale gaze across the long expanse of the conference table.
“The European portfolio?” I repeated, my tone laced with dry amusement.
Blaine tried to reclaim a sliver of composure, straightening his spine. “Yes. The twenty-billion-euro deal in Germany that’s up for renewal. You’ve been the lead director for that, haven’t you?”
I offered a slight smile, utterly devoid of warmth.
“I was the director, yes.”
“But didn’t you just personally declare, Mr. Harrison, that a forty-year-old piece of deadwood doesn’t deserve a high salary at this company?”
“So, what is it? Do you plan to entrust a two-billion-dollar project to a ‘piece of deadwood’?”
My words were like a blade of ice, surgically aimed at his most vulnerable spot.
Blaine’s face cycled through shades of red and white. His voice softened, carrying a hint of desperation and damage control. “I said a salary reduction, not a termination. Of course, the project remains your responsibility.”
I gently shook my head, my gaze sweeping over every executive present.
“A fifteen-thousand-dollar-a-month salary to manage a two-billion-dollar annual contract?”
“Mr. Harrison, you aren’t insulting me. You’re insulting the project, and you’re insulting the fifteen years of trust this company has built with that client.”
Muted murmurs began to ripple through the room.
The Operations Director couldn't hold back. “Mr. Harrison, the European contract is mission-critical. Mr. Klaus in Germany only recognizes Elias.”
Blaine lost his temper, slamming his hand on the table, trying to drown out his own insecurity with volume.
“Elias Vic, don’t push your luck! The company invested in you for years! Is this how you repay that investment?”
“Investment?”
His choice of word actually made me laugh—a short, sharp burst of air. I pulled out my phone, opening a document I’d kept filed away for fifteen years.
I turned the screen toward him, my voice quiet but every word carrying the weight of a ton of bricks.
“Three hundred and nineteen trips to Europe. An average of twenty-one flights per year. Enough air miles to circle the globe dozens of times.”
“It took me five years to crack the German market, which the entire industry called an impenetrable fortress.”
“It took me eight years to build a sales channel from scratch that covers all of Western Europe.”
“Last year, the European division’s revenue accounted for forty-two percent of this corporation’s total income.”
“Mr. Harrison, do you call that an investment? I was the one investing my life.”
Cathy, my assistant, her eyes red with anger, spoke up beside me, her voice firm. “All the core European clients—Mr. Vic won them, one drink, one pitch, one relentless visit after another. Many of them only trust his face, his word, and his integrity.”
Blaine’s breathing grew ragged. He glared at me, his eyes practically trying to tear me apart.
“So what do you want?” he ground out through clenched teeth.
I pocketed my phone, my expression returning to the profound calm I’d started with.
“I don’t want anything.”
“I’ve signed the salary reduction agreement. As per company policy, my official termination is three days from now.”
“As for this two-billion-dollar European portfolio, Mr. Harrison, you’re an accomplished MBA from a top-tier school, a man of exceptional capability. I’ll leave it to you.”
With that, I didn't spare a second glance at his distorted, enraged face. I turned and walked out of the conference room with a steady, decisive stride.
As the door clicked shut behind me, I thought I heard the faint, chilling sound of a world beginning to crack.

I returned to my Director’s office, the one I had occupied for ten years, and began quietly packing my personal belongings.
Fifteen years of accumulation—not too much, but certainly not little.
My phone hadn't stopped vibrating since I got back to the office, a stream of messages from my team members and friendly directors in other departments, all expressing their sympathy and shock.
I didn't reply to any of them.
The office door burst open. Cathy was the first to rush in, her eyes red and swollen, clutching a crumpled piece of paper.
“Mr. Vic, I quit too! I was on the reduction list. They slashed me from eighteen thousand to eight thousand. They’re trying to force us out!”
As she finished speaking, the six other core members of the European market team filed in one by one.
Each of them held a signed copy of the reduction agreement and a freshly printed resignation letter.
“Elias, we’re done with them.”
“This place is toxic. It’s like kicking the horse after it carried you across the finish line.”
“We’re leaving with you!”
I looked at the men and women standing before me—my team, some of whom had been with me for five years, others for a decade—and a wave of warmth washed over me. My eyes pricked with emotion.
I suppressed the surge of feeling and urged them to be rational. “Hold on, all of you. Think this through. You all have families, mortgages, car payments. Don’t be impulsive.”
Cathy stepped forward, her voice choked with tears but utterly resolute.
“Elias, you didn’t just teach us how to do business. You taught us how to be professionals with dignity.”
“If they can do this to you today, they’ll do it to us tomorrow. We can’t stay in a company that disrespects its champions.”
Just then, the Head of HR came scurrying into the office without even knocking, his face etched with panic.
Gasping for breath, he pleaded, “Mr. Vic, please, don’t do anything hasty. Mr. Harrison asked me to deliver a message: The salary cut… it’s negotiable. Everything can be negotiated!”
I ignored him, turning instead to look out the window at the gray sky hanging over the city.
“Tell him it’s too late.”
At three that afternoon, Blaine Harrison, likely realizing the true gravity of the situation, personally came down to our floor.
The moment he saw the seven neatly stacked resignation letters on my desk, his young, handsome face turned a sickening shade of green.
Furious, he pointed a finger directly at me, his voice thin and shrill with anger.
“Elias Vic, you’re gutting the company! This is malicious incitement of a collective resignation!”
I calmly filed the last document into my cardboard box, then looked up at him.
“Mr. Harrison, you were the one who started digging up the foundations of this wall. Have you ever heard of a principle where you starve the horse to death and then expect it to run the fastest?”
Blaine was momentarily speechless. He quickly resorted to threats.
“Fine! Very well! All of you, remember this: Every single one of you signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement and a Non-Compete clause! I’d like to see which competitor’s doorstep you dare show up on!”
Hearing this, I actually smiled.
I pulled my employment contract from a drawer, flipped to the Non-Compete page, and pointed it out to him.
“Mr. Harrison, please read the terms carefully. The Non-Compete clause only takes effect if the company pays three full months of severance in a timely manner.”
“If you’re willing to transfer the total severance package for all seven of us—several hundred thousand dollars—right now, we will absolutely adhere to the agreement.”
“I’ll wait for the wire transfer.”
Blaine’s face turned the color of a bruised plum.

At nine that night, as I was moving the last box of my belongings into my apartment, an unfamiliar number flashed on my phone.
I answered, and a steady, hearty male voice came through.
“Is this Elias Vic? This is Jonathan Zhou from OmniCorp.”
OmniCorp: my former company’s biggest competitor in the domestic market.
Jonathan Zhou: OmniCorp’s founder and CEO, a shrewd operator known industry-wide for his reputation for spotting and valuing talent.
“Mr. Zhou, hello.” I was genuinely surprised.
Jonathan got straight to the point, his voice containing a note of barely suppressed surprise and excitement.
“Mr. Vic, I just heard the news—you’ve left your former employer?”
I leaned back on my sofa, rubbing my tired temples, a bitter chuckle escaping me.
“Mr. Zhou, your intelligence network is impressive. I finalized my paperwork at five, and it’s only been four hours.”
Jonathan laughed heartily. “A man like Elias Vic is always the focus of the industry, no matter the move.”
He skipped the pleasantries and immediately extended an offer, his tone sincere and irresistible.
“Elias, I won’t waste your time with small talk. Come to OmniCorp. I’m offering you the position of Group Vice President, overseeing our entire international business segment. A two-million-dollar annual salary, plus equity incentives.”
The terms were several times better than my salary before the reduction.
I paused for three seconds, running a quick calculation in my head.
“Mr. Zhou, thank you for the generous offer. I have one condition.”
“Name it.”
“I need to bring my six core team members with me.”
Jonathan on the other end didn't hesitate for a second. He agreed immediately and enthusiastically.
“No problem! Any talent you value, OmniCorp welcomes with open arms! The compensation will be top-tier—nothing less than what they were earning, if not more!”
We agreed to meet the next morning at OmniCorp headquarters for a detailed discussion.
I hung up, letting out a long sigh, and looked out at the glittering city lights against the night sky, a mix of complex emotions churning inside me.
Just then, my phone screen lit up again—a video call request from Germany.
It was my biggest client and long-time friend, Mr. Klaus.
I answered the call. Mr. Klaus’s wrinkled face was etched with worry and anger.
“Elias, my friend, I just heard an incredible story. They said your salary was cut, and you’re leaving?”
I was startled. This was internal corporate drama. How did he know about it from all the way in Germany?
“Mr. Klaus, how did you find out?”
Mr. Klaus’s mustache was practically vibrating with indignation.
“This afternoon, the new, young CEO’s assistant from your company called me. He told me that all European business would be directly managed by them from now on. The young man’s attitude was appallingly arrogant, as if he were granting me a favor!”
“I only recognize you, Elias! We’ve worked together for ten years! I only trust you! If you truly leave that company, I will pull our order immediately!”
Hearing the voice of my old friend, a current of warmth instantly surged through me.
Fifteen years of dedication, fifteen years of building trust through genuine connection—it had finally given me the loudest, most resolute answer I could have hoped for.

At ten the next morning, my team and I formally signed our contracts in the conference room at OmniCorp headquarters.
Jonathan Zhou greeted us personally, without a trace of the corporate executive’s aloofness, treating us like long-lost friends.
My contract clearly stated: Group Vice President, two million annual salary, and three percent in equity incentives.
Cathy and the other six members’ compensation was doubled, and each of them received a promotion.
Cathy’s hand trembled slightly as she signed the papers and looked at the contract.
She leaned close to me, her voice catching with emotion. “Elias, we’ve finally found a company that truly understands and respects talent.”
Jonathan clapped me on the shoulder, his eyes full of admiration and expectation.
“To be honest, Elias, I’ve been waiting three years for the opportunity to poach you. From now on, OmniCorp’s entire European market is in your hands.”
Meanwhile, my former company was plunging into unprecedented chaos.
Blaine Harrison had urgently convened all senior management. The atmosphere in the conference room was so thick you could cut it with a knife.
The Operations Director reported anxiously, “Mr. Harrison, what do we do about the European portfolio? We have three days left to renew the twenty-billion-euro contract with Germany’s Mr. Klaus!”
According to later leaks, Blaine was still in denial. He slammed the table again, his voice thin and blustering.
“Don’t panic! How much leverage can a forty-year-old middle manager possibly have? The company doesn’t stop for anyone! We’ll send some young exec over. I refuse to believe the Germans will sacrifice our partnership for him!”
The Head of HR quietly reminded him, “Mr. Harrison, the German office has already explicitly emailed us, stating that the renewal must be handled personally by Director Vic, or they will reassess the entire relationship.”
Blaine waved his hand dismissively, clearly unaffected.
“Then we’ll find other clients! Europe is a massive market. Are we really afraid of not finding a single partner? What a joke!”
The moment the words left his mouth, his assistant rushed into the room, his face paper-white.
