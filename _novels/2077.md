When my wife Diana fell ill, it was the first time I'd ever set foot in her company.

The receptionist looked utterly shocked:

"You can't be serious. The Diana you're asking about is our CEO. And she's already married..."

The next moment, my wife—who should have been in a hospital bed—stepped out of the elevator, linked arm-in-arm with her first love.

Our eyes met, and her smile froze instantly.

I stared at her, who dressed head to toe in designer labels, and demanded:

"You told me your startup failed. I sold the only house my parents left me to pay your debts. I coded by day and delivered takeout by night. I had a bleeding ulcer but couldn't afford to see a doctor! Tell me—why did you string me along like this?!"

Diana remained silent.

Her first love smirked and clapped me on the shoulder.

"Buddy, don't blame her. When she married you, she promised me everything, so her body, her money, everything…would always be mine."

I shrugged off his hand and laughed bitterly.

Did he honestly think he could take everything?
