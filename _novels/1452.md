I received an electricity bill for a villa I hadn’t visited in ages.
Weird, right? So I drove over there.
Pushing open the door, I found the place packed with my old college classmates!
And right in the middle of the crowd, my fiancée was passionately making out with my arch-rival.
Before I could even speak, my rival spotted me first.
He had his arm around my fiancée, a sneer plastered across his face.
"Liam, this isn't a place for a nobody like you. Get lost!"
My fiancée chimed in, equally annoyed.
"Liam, seriously, stop hounding me. What we had was just a fling. A broke scrub like you could never be good enough for me."
I rolled my eyes, pulled out my phone, and dialed the police.
"Hello, I'd like to report a break-in. Someone's trespassing on private property."

The moment I pushed open the door, my college arch-rival, Brandon Pierce, had one hand gripping Chloe Davis's butt, while they were locked in a passionate French kiss.
Everyone froze when they saw me, then a wave of whispers swept through the room.
"What's Liam Caldwell doing here? Did anyone even invite him?"
"I heard Liam was totally obsessed with Chloe back in college."
"He's such a poor loser, how could he ever be worthy of Chloe?"
"But wait, I heard Chloe was actually Liam's fiancée?"
…
Honestly, I wasn't supposed to be here at all. I'd booked a flight to go back home and see my parents, but just before I left, I got that utility bill.
My first thought was some homeless person had broken in, so I decided to check it out.
After all, this villa was supposed to be Chloe's birthday gift, and it had only been renovated two months ago.
I'd planned to tell her my real identity when I gave her the villa – that I wasn't just some regular guy, but the heir to a multi-billion dollar empire.
But who would've thought? She was cheating on me with another man in my villa, and that man was my arch-rival!
Seeing my silence, Brandon aimed a spotlight at me, raising a microphone and shouting, "Liam, what are you doing crashing my party? I certainly didn't invite you."
I frowned. "You didn't, but this is my…"
He cut me off before I could finish.
Brandon sneered. "Since I didn't invite you, how could you be so thick-skinned to show up at my place?! Or, after more than ten years, have you finally remembered to apologize to me?"
Brandon and I were from two different worlds, but in our sophomore year, he came to me for help to pass an exam. He offered me five hundred bucks to help him cheat.
The moment I took his money, I went straight to the professor and reported him.
He got penalized by the school, and from then on, he became my sworn enemy, constantly trying to torment me.
After graduation, we hadn't had any contact.
I shook my head. "Even if I had a hundred do-overs, I still wouldn't help you cheat."
Though my words were firm, Brandon just thought I was being stubborn. "Don't act so tough! I totally get people like you!"
"Nerd! You thought you could make up for my family's wealth by studying hard in school, only to realize once you entered the real world that even if you got into a prestigious university, you'd just end up as a lapdog for rich people like us."
"But, I won't stoop to your level, you country bumpkin. Just kneel down, call me 'Daddy,' and lick my shoes clean, and I'll forgive you."
