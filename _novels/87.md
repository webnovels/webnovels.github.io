I was kidnapped by my father's enemy.

They demanded a ransom of $10 million. To my shock, my father wasn't even willing to pay $1000 for me. He told them to just keep me as a wife instead.

"If your father doesn't pay up, you know what will happen to you, right?" the kidnapper threatened to throw me into the sea.

My teeth chattered as I replied, "I know."

A year later, my father finally called. The man yelled at him: "Forget the money, just take her back! I'm not your babysitter!"

He hung up the phone, chewing on a cigarette as he angrily scrubbed my little stuffed animal.
