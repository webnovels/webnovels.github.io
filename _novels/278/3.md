“Besides, since she’s an illegitimate daughter, if I marry her, the Thorne family will be her sole foundation within the Hayes family. She certainly won’t betray me.”

Currently, Blake Miller was being flattered and courted by everyone in our circle. Countless people rushed to meet and connect with him.

After all, a strong alliance between the Hayes and Miller families would undoubtedly elevate their respective industries to the next level.

I had no time for these matters. I was focused on completing the task my mother had assigned me abroad.

One day, on Grandpa Hayes’s birthday, Blake actually sent me an invitation and called me several times, leaving me no choice but to go.

The moment I stepped through the Hayes family’s front door, all eyes fell on me.

I showed no hint of awkwardness, smiling as I handed the gift to the Hayes family butler.

“Why is Asher Thorne here? Didn’t the engagement change?”

“You don’t know? At the time, Miss Hayes insisted on switching, and he, in a fit of pique, chose to get engaged to that illegitimate daughter of the Hayes family.”

“Even marrying an illegitimate daughter just to get into the Hayes family—Mr. Thorne certainly isn’t afraid to go to extremes.”

Just as everyone was buzzing, Chloe Hayes appeared, grandly linked arm-in-arm with Blake Miller.

Unlike her usual understated and gentle attire, she was wearing a haute couture gown today, adorned with several sets of elaborate, luxurious jewelry, making her look ostentatious but also a bit tacky.

And Blake? His suit alone was worth a fortune, and the watch on his wrist was comparable to the price of a luxury mansion.

He spotted me there and came over, trying to sling an arm around my shoulder in a familiar gesture.

“Little brother, it’s wonderful that both of us brothers can be sons-in-law of the Hayes family! For brotherly affection, I’ll definitely ask Chloe to help out your wife.”

I almost laughed at Blake. Even now, he still thought I cared about marrying just *any* Hayes daughter.

Chloe seemed to think the same thing. In her eyes, I’d gone to extreme lengths to try and marry her, and she looked at me as if I were something dirty.

I couldn’t be bothered with these two and turned to leave, but then I noticed a jade pendant of excellent quality around Blake’s neck.

This was the Hayes family’s ancestral jade pendant, always kept by Grandpa Hayes. I never expected it to be on Blake.

The Hayes family heir hadn’t even been confirmed yet, so how could this jade pendant be on Blake?

I pointed to the jade pendant on Blake’s neck, a hint of scrutiny in my eyes.

“Where did that pendant come from?”

Chloe showed a fleeting moment of guilt, while Blake caressed the jade pendant on his neck, looking slightly wronged.

“Little brother, this was originally meant for you, but now that I’m the one marrying Chloe, this jade pendant naturally goes to me.”

Chloe also nodded self-righteously. After all, in her mind, she was the definite heir, so letting her beloved wear the jade pendant a little early was perfectly acceptable.

“This is my Hayes family’s ancestral jade pendant. I can let anyone wear it I choose. What does it have to do with you?”

After saying that, she looked me up and down with disdain and stepped back.

“Don’t you dare try to use this to cling to me. I will never like you. My heart belongs only to Blake.”

Chloe’s voice wasn’t quiet, and several gazes around us fell on me.

“Asher Thorne usually seems so refined, but I never thought he’d be so desperate to latch onto the Hayes family that he’d even try to steal his brother’s fiancée.”

“They’re clearly in love. Why is he still trying to cling on?”

Blake’s face flushed red, and he gently tugged at Chloe’s arm.

“Don’t be so harsh on Asher, sweetie. Once he marries Harper, we’ll still be family. You’ll have to help them out then.”

Chloe glanced at me, then affectionately tilted her head and pinched Blake’s cheek.

“Fine, for Blake’s sake, I won’t hold it against you. But if you have any inappropriate thoughts about me, don’t blame me for being ruthless.”

As the two of them were still basking in their loving display, a voice suddenly echoed from behind them.

“Why would my husband have inappropriate thoughts about you, Chloe? You’re being very rude to your future brother-in-law.”


Harper Hayes entered, supporting Grandpa Hayes. A faint smile played on her lips, and her eyes held a hint of challenge as she looked at Chloe.

Grandpa Hayes’s gaze fell on the jade pendant around Blake’s neck, and his expression darkened.
