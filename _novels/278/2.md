Once Grandpa Hayes gave his word, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.

This family alliance had invited many prominent business figures to witness the event, and everyone was eager to see how it would unfold.

Amidst the whispers, Chloe took Blake’s hand and faced the assembled guests to make her announcement.

“Thank you all for coming today to attend my engagement ceremony with Mr. Blake Miller.”

The guests’ expressions varied; no one had expected the Hayes and Miller families to make such a public switch.

My father, Mr. Davies, hadn’t anticipated this either. His face instantly darkened, and mine wasn't much better. Yet, I forced myself to stand tall, back straight, and amidst the murmurs, I raised my glass and presented a lavish gift.

“Miss Hayes just switched fiancés on the spot. She didn’t give Asher Thorne any face at all.”

“Didn’t Grandpa Hayes insist on Asher Thorne being his grandson-in-law? Why did he agree to the change?”

“Changing partners on the day of the engagement — that’s truly embarrassing. I wonder what he did to make Miss Hayes take such an drastic step.”

The guests’ discussions weren’t quiet. My father glared at Blake, and he didn’t hold back with Chloe either.

“By doing this, how much gossip will you subject your brother to?”

“And you, Blake, you’re not a child anymore. Acting without considering the consequences, are you trying to slap me in the face?”

Blake, chastised by my father, timidly tried to take the ring off to give it back to me.

Grandpa Hayes waved him off. He guiltily patted my head and said in a low voice,

“Ash, don’t worry. Grandpa Hayes will handle this for you. If you’re willing, the Hayes family has several other excellent young women.”

Mr. and Mrs. Hayes overheard Grandpa’s words and simply assumed he was comforting me, so they didn't pay much attention.

What they didn't expect was for me to point to Harper Hayes, the Hayes family’s illegitimate daughter, who was watching the spectacle from a corner.

“Actually, I’ve always liked Harper. I hope Grandpa can approve of our union.”

Their gazes fell on Harper, their eyes darting between her and me.

Harper was Mr. Hayes’s elder brother’s illegitimate daughter. After her uncle passed away, she wasn't well-regarded at home and lived a rather difficult life.

Since she was still a Hayes by blood, Grandpa Hayes didn’t want others to say the family mistreated her, so he brought her to live with him and raised her personally.

My father looked at me in shock, then whispered in my ear, “Ash, Dad knows you’re upset, but she’s an illegitimate daughter. The Hayes family doesn’t value her at all.”

I nonchalantly swirled my drink, raising my glass in Harper’s direction.

“She didn’t choose to be an illegitimate daughter. I think she’s perfectly fine, and I’m willing to give things a try with her.”

Harper’s eyes met mine, her demeanor relaxed.

“Since Mr. Thorne likes me, then let’s give it a shot.”

Everyone’s gazes on me grew even more meaningful.

News of the Hayes family changing partners on the spot spread rapidly through the social circle. The moment the banquet ended, I received a text from my mother.

In the private room, my mother, Eleanor Thorne, hugged me tightly, her eyes glinting with displeasure as she looked at my father, Mr. Davies.

“Mr. Davies, how dare you let my son suffer such a humiliation?! Do you want to lose your job?”

I squeezed my mother’s hand, redirecting the conversation to the important matter.

“Grandpa Hayes has found me a new fiancée. Her name is Harper Hayes, and I actually quite like her.”

My father wiped the sweat from his brow and sighed again.

“She’s just an illegitimate daughter, a peripheral figure in the Hayes family. Why would you choose her?”

I looked at my parents’ bewildered expressions and slowly began to explain.

“Grandpa Hayes and Grandpa Thorne established this marriage alliance, and I am definitely going to marry a Hayes daughter.”

“Although Harper is an illegitimate daughter, she’s the most capable among the younger generation of the Hayes family, and also the smartest and most composed. From a business perspective, she is the most suitable partner for cooperation.”
