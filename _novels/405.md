After I donated a kidney for the man my girlfriend adored, Savannah, who had been giving me the silent treatment for a month, finally agreed to reconcile. 

She even set up a dinner party, calling it a "reward" for me.

Her best friend, Kinsley, chuckled, “Savannah, you really know how to handle him. 

Caleb listens to you, and he’s completely devoted.

 Are you really going to throw away such a sweet guy and marry Ryder instead?”

Savannah scoffed, a disdainful smirk playing on her lips. 

“He’s nothing but a stand-in. The only reason I haven’t gotten tired of him after all these years is that he’s a dead ringer for Ryder.”

Their eyes met, a shared understanding passing between them. 

“Well, then, why not have Caleb be the best man at your wedding? That way, all his eight years with you won’t have been for nothing.”

But Savannah just let out a cold laugh. 

“What a joke! Who is he to stand next to Ryder?” 

She paused, then added, “This dinner party is just a pat on the back for helping Ryder out. Consider it a consolation prize for all his years chasing after me.”

I had just reached the door and heard every word. Pushing the door open calmly, I didn’t retort.

She had no idea that today was the last day I’d be her stand-in.

Tomorrow, my one true love would be back.
