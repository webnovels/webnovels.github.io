The Driver's Daughter crafted a facade of wealth to become the school's most popular girl, while she spread rumors that I was just an infatuated admirer.

When valuable items were stolen from her home, she pleaded with me not to involve the police, only to later lead the effort to ostracize me at school.

I was falsely accused of assaulting a female classmate. As my parents sought the truth, she leaked our family's confidential information to our competitors.

After being framed, my family went bankrupt and ended up homeless.

One night, a disturbed individual attacked us with a knife, and she watched in her designer clothes, laughing at our misfortune.

When I opened my eyes again, I was back in the past, before it all began.

Once more, the Driver's Daughter was flaunting her wealth in front of the class: "This weekend, I'm inviting everyone to the Mansion for a party!"

As everyone cheered, I immediately sent a message: no Mansion events allowed.

Forget being the top socialite; if I don't stand up for myself, they'll think I'm a fool!
