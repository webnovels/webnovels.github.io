Adrian hasn't touched me in the three years we've been married.

I put on a lace nightgown, faked some kiss marks, and sent him a sleeping selfie from his perspective.

"Dude, she smells amazing. Why don't you divorce her and let me have her?"

I guessed Adrian would be disgusted and angry when he received this anonymous message, and would throw me away like trash, the sister who was just a replacement.

I thought that this time, I'd finally be able to divorce him.
