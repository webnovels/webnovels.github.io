At Alpha Evan's birthday party, my foster mother, Brenda, planned to drug Alpha Evan's heir, Kyle, with a powerful aphrodisiac. Her goal was to force a mating with Kyle for my foster sister, Lydia.

But Alpha Evan had lost his true mate years ago, and Kyle was his only heir. He was fiercely possessive of Kyle; countless women who had tried to seduce Kyle met gruesome ends at his hands.

In my last life, to protect Lydia, I shattered the drugged glass and helped Lydia escape the party.

Later, at a different gathering, Kyle found out I was his true mate.

Lydia, furious at losing the chance to become the future Luna, completely lost her mind.

And me? On the eve of my wedding, my foster mother locked me in the basement:

"You knew Lydia loved Kyle! Why did you steal her man? You're just a lowly Omega! You don't deserve to be Luna!"

She stripped me bare, then summoned a group of vicious Rogue wolves and left me to their mercy.

After three days and three nights of unspeakable torment, my foster mother threw me off a cliff, leaving me for the wild beasts to tear apart and devour.

They, however, leveraged Kyle's grief and love for me to extract a hefty compensation.

When I opened my eyes again, I was back on the day my foster mother was about to drug Kyle.
