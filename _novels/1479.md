My brother brought his girlfriend home for a holiday dinner for the first time.

During the dinner, his girlfriend suddenly turned to me.

“Chloe Davis, you look so familiar! I remember now! I saw your pictures on Pornhub. You have a really hot body.”

She finished, then quickly clapped a hand over her mouth, pretending she’d spoken out of turn.

All the relatives at the dinner were stunned. Then, they started pointing fingers at me.

“Young people these days really have no morals.”

“What’s her stage name? I wanna check it out too!”

I, however, calmly set down my fork and smiled at her.

“I also think you look familiar. Oh, I remember now, I performed several abortions on you!”


My brother was bringing his girlfriend home this year, and my mom was so thrilled she gathered all our relatives for a big family dinner.

At the dinner table, my brother’s girlfriend, Serena Lewis, was incredibly well-behaved.

She proposed toasts to the adults, told jokes, and not only charmed my mom completely, but even had the relatives praising Brandon for his good taste.

Just as everyone was soaking in the warm atmosphere Serena had created, a relative turned to me.

“Chloe, you work in New York. You must be earning a lot of money! Your cousin graduates next year; you really should help her find a good job!”

Other relatives chimed in.

“Your mom says you give her fifteen hundred dollars a month. That’s amazing! Not like our useless son, who can’t even find a job.”

“Chloe, what exactly do you do in the big city?”

I was about to answer when Serena suddenly put down her glass and asked me.

“Chloe, even though this is our first time meeting, I just feel like I’ve seen you before!”

I offered a polite smile. “Maybe I just have one of those faces.”

Serena shook her head, staring intently at me, scrutinizing my features.

“No, it’s not an average face. I definitely saw you somewhere… Ah!”

It was as if something clicked for her, and a look of sudden realization dawned on her face.

“I know! You’re an influencer on Pornhub, aren’t you?”

The moment she said that, several relatives at the table visibly stiffened.

Serena seemed oblivious to the sudden change in atmosphere and continued.

“I’ve seen your pictures; your body is so hot! I can’t believe I’m seeing you in person now!”

She finished, then abruptly clapped a hand over her mouth, looking like someone who’d just said something regrettable.

I was stunned. I couldn't believe Serena would fabricate such a rumor right there.

My first instinct was to confront her.

“What in the world are you talking about?”

She immediately put on a show of being wronged and apologized.

“I’m so sorry, Chloe! I just spoke without thinking! I never imagined it would be you. I really didn’t mean it, please don’t be angry.”

Serena’s words were so direct that all the relatives’ gazes shifted, scrutinizing me.

“Young people these days are so… open-minded.”

“No wonder she always says she’s busy and only comes home once a year. So that’s what she’s been busy with.”

“No wonder she’s so rich. She’s selling herself!”

“How embarrassing!”

The relative who had just asked me to help her daughter find a job quickly retracted her words, clearly worried I might lead her daughter astray.

“What I said earlier doesn’t count. My daughter would never do something like that; it’s utterly disgraceful!”

My mom’s face was beet red from the relatives’ whispers, her hands trembling.

She looked at me in disbelief. “Chloe, are you really an influencer on Pornhub?”

My brother’s eyes were also red with anger, glaring at me.

“Chloe, is what she said true? Did you really do something so shameless?”

“No, I didn’t!”

I cut them off, my voice firm and resolute.

Hearing my explanation, they still looked skeptical, their faces tight with doubt.

I stared at Serena, the architect of this slander, a suffocating knot of anger in my chest.

This was my first time meeting Serena. We had no history, no grudge, yet she had inexplicably pulled a stunt like this.

I said, my voice low.

“Serena, you can’t just go around spreading lies. Defamation is a serious offense!”

At my words, Serena seemed to grow even more tearful.

Her eyes red, she whispered timidly.

“Chloe, I really didn’t mean it. Can you please forgive me?”

It was something that could have been cleared up with a single sentence, but Serena deliberately chose to be vague.

I truly didn't know what I had done to provoke her.

But for Brandon’s sake, I still managed to hold back my anger.

“Serena, the person you’re talking about isn’t me, and it couldn’t possibly be me. You must be mistaken.”

I tried to guide her toward an explanation, but she acted as if I was pressuring her.

She immediately choked up.

“Chloe, don’t be so mean, you’re scaring me. I truly didn’t mean it. I didn’t know your family would care so much about this… I just thought the person in the photo looked a lot like you and casually mentioned it. How can you say I’m slandering you?”

Serena kept circling back to the same point, continuously implying that I had been involved in something illicit but was too ashamed to admit it.

This time, I couldn't hold back anymore and yelled.

“Serena, we have no personal vendetta. There’s no need for you to target me like this!”

And then Serena cried.

She sobbed, hiding behind my brother, presenting herself as a poor, wronged victim.

She explained to Brandon.

“I’m just a straightforward person, I say what I think. Brandon, you have to believe me, I really wasn’t targeting Chloe.”

Seeing her distress, Brandon immediately pulled her into his arms to comfort her.

Then he turned on me, furious.

“Chloe, do you have to be so aggressive? If you really didn’t do anything like that, how could Serena just make it up out of thin air? Don’t you have any self-awareness?”

My brother’s barrage of accusations, his words, showed no regard for my situation as his sister.

Even if our sibling relationship wasn’t the best, I never imagined he’d side with an outsider to bully me after hearing just a few words.

The relatives, hearing him, chimed in their agreement.

“Exactly, if you don’t want people to know, don’t do it!”

“Serena is such a sweet, sensible girl; how could she possibly spread rumors without reason!”

“I think Chloe really did something shameful!”

My mom slammed her hand on the table, pointing a finger at my nose.

“Chloe! You tell me clearly! Did you or did you not do those unspeakable things? If you really did, I’ll disown you!”

I reiterated to my mom that I hadn't done anything.

Then I scanned the faces of all the relatives present, my gaze finally landing on Serena.

I said.

“Serena, since you claim you saw my photos in that ‘circle,’ then produce the evidence. Otherwise, I’m calling the police right now to report you for defamation!”

Serena’s eyes flickered, then she stood up to go get her phone from the room.

“To prove my innocence, I’ll find those photos and show them to you right now!”

Soon, she returned with her phone and, in front of everyone, pulled up *that* photo of me.

She let everyone browse the picture, then thrust it in front of my face.

Her tone was slightly triumphant.

“Chloe, see for yourself. It’s really not me slandering you! I just had my best friend’s boyfriend look it up on that site. This side profile picture is definitely you!”

The full-body side profile photo on Serena’s phone showed someone in revealing lingerie, and the side profile did indeed bear a nine-tenths resemblance to me. But I hadn’t done it, so I wouldn’t admit to it.

As soon as Serena came back with her phone, I felt a pang of suspicion, like I’d been secretly photographed.

I vocalized my thought.

“What can a side profile picture prove?”

“Oh, right. You just secretly photographed me, didn’t you? And used my picture for AI synthesis?”

I stared into Serena’s eyes, and sure enough, I saw a flicker of guilt.

But she stubbornly refused to admit it.

She once again put on that wronged, pitiful expression, choking out.

“Chloe, you can’t accuse me just because you don’t want to admit it! We’re family; why would I slander you?”

“I should have known better than to come with Brandon. If it weren’t for me, your family would definitely be happy!”

Serena spoke with such apparent sincerity that the relatives quickly rallied to her defense.

Aunt Carol mocked me for having no upbringing.

“Chloe, you’re shameless, and you still have the nerve to blame others? Having you as a relative truly embarrasses me!”

Uncle Robert angrily reprimanded me for disgracing the family name.

“Our Davis family reputation will be ruined by you! How can you face us, how can you face your deceased father?”

Other relatives chimed in, their words as malicious as possible.

“Shameless, what was the point of college?”

“If she were my daughter, I’d have slapped her to death already!”

“So unlucky to have such a dirty thing in the family!”

My mom listened, trembling all over.

She had always been very concerned with appearances, and now, seeing the so-called evidence, she was absolutely furious.

“Chloe, how did I raise you? You insist on shamelessly degrading yourself, don’t you? How could I have given birth to such a disgraceful daughter like you!”

Hearing the harsh accusations, I felt a deep sense of powerlessness.

My own mother and brother, the people closest to me, didn't believe me.

At the same time, Serena spoke again.

This time, she urged me to admit my mistake and turn over a new leaf.

She said.

“Chloe, it doesn’t matter if your body is dirty, as long as your heart isn’t! Don’t worry, we won’t tell anyone about this.”

At her words, I let out a cold laugh, then spoke with a chilling edge.

“Serena, you know best whether the person in that photo is me or not!”

“As for 'dirty,' you’re the dirtiest one here!”

I locked eyes with Serena, wanting to see just how far her depravity truly went.

Serena seemed startled by me, instinctively shrinking further into my brother’s arms, her voice trembling slightly.

“You… what are you talking about! How am I dirty? You’re the one selling your body, not me!”
