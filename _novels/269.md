The maid's daughter in our house somehow got her hands on three magic chickens that could swap things.

The first one, she used to swap my perfectly healthy baby for her own deformed one.

The second, she swapped her identity as the maid's daughter for my identity as the true heiress.

The third, she swapped for my husband, the scion of a powerful elite family.

Later, I ended up homeless, kidnapped with my deformed child, trafficked overseas, and eventually died a horrific death.

When I opened my eyes again, my sister was bringing me chicken soup. I was still recovering from childbirth.

I took it with a cold smirk. Once she left, I poured it out for the cook’s dog, who had just had puppies.
