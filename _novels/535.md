Julian suffered from emotional detachment.

We were together for seven long years, yet he never once believed I truly loved him. Every heartfelt word I poured into those letters was dismissed as nothing but a lie, a cheap charade. 

Everyone else branded me a gold-digger. And he? He just met their scornful gazes with a cold stare, utterly indifferent.

It wasn't until the sunflowers I’d planted for him in the backyard finally bloomed, and my sacrifices were laid bare for the world to see, that Julian finally believed I loved him.

But what he didn't know was this: I was already dead.

I died exactly one year ago today. The mountain crumbled, burying me, but not before I used every last ounce of strength to push him to safety. 

Yet, Julian walked away without a single glance back, never even mentioning me to anyone. Trapped in that mountain, waiting for a rescue that never came, I slowly, painfully starved to death.

He always longed to hear me say 'I love you.' He knew I couldn't speak, but never bothered to learn my sign language. He never knew that every single morning, my first thought, my first silent word, was 'I love you.'
