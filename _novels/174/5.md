I was surprised, not understanding why she was so angry.

Once before, when it was raining and she was with Remy, I had called a few times to ask where she was and when she'd be back, offering to pick her up.

She had been furious, saying I was worrying unnecessarily, that she was with Remy and he would send her home.

She had also accused me of not being able to stand her being with Remy, using the rain as an excuse to make her come home quickly, saying my controlling behavior was suffocating her.

Now that I was giving her the freedom she wanted and not worrying, she was questioning why I wasn't going to pick her up. I really didn't understand what she wanted.

I replied calmly, "You're with Remy, so I have nothing to worry about. You can stay out longer if you want, he'll naturally send you home."

Xena stared at me with wide eyes in disbelief, perhaps wondering how I could speak so calmly about Remy and allow them to stay out late together.

A moment later, she seemed to think of something and started explaining, "Today is the anniversary of Remy's mother's death. He's very upset, and as his friend, I couldn't bear to leave him alone. Don't misunderstand."

I nodded in understanding. "I get it. You should keep him company on days like this."

My reasonableness seemed to leave Xena at a loss for words.

She looked at my face intently, trying to find even a hint of anger, but found none.

Xena softened her voice, "Ezra, I bought a new nightgown. It's black lace. Want to see if it suits me?"

I looked at her in surprise. This was tantamount to her actively seeking reconciliation.

In the past, she always maintained a high and mighty attitude, only reluctantly making up with me after I had begged countless times.

I pretended not to understand her implication and simply said, "No need. If you like it, that's fine. You should go back to your room and sleep now."

Xena looked at me in disbelief, then stormed off in embarrassment and anger.

I got up to close the door myself, then went back to bed.

I slept well that night.

The next morning, my friend Mike called to invite me to dinner.

He had just returned from a business trip and, hearing that I was going back home, wanted to meet up one last time, saying such opportunities would be rare in the future.

I felt a pang in my heart as I listened, and agreed.

Before hanging up, he added, "Oh, bring Xena along too. I won't call her separately."

Right, Mike wasn't just my friend, but Xena's friend too.

He had introduced us initially.

But this meant I couldn't keep my return home a secret anymore. I hadn't finished dealing with everything and didn't want any complications.

After hanging up, I saw Xena coming out.

I hesitated for a moment, then looked up and said to her, "Mike wants to invite us to dinner tonight."

She looked at me hesitantly, about to speak when her phone rang.

I don't know what the person on the other end said, but Xena responded soothingly, "Remy, don't worry. It won't be lost. I'll come over right away to help you look."

Xena hung up the phone and hurriedly walked towards the door, changing her shoes swiftly while telling me, "Ezra, Remy has an emergency and needs my help. You go to dinner by yourself tonight. I won't be going. Let Mike know for me."

That evening, at a local barbecue place, just as Mike and I clinked our beer glasses, Xena walked in with Remy beside her.

When our eyes met, Xena looked surprised and embarrassed.

Remy, next to her, gave me a challenging smile.
