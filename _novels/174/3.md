I went to the office to submit my resignation letter. My manager was surprised and tried to persuade me to stay, but I insisted on leaving.

I had originally taken this job to be close to Xena, to take care of her.

But now, that was no longer necessary.

Last night, I had a video call with my parents, telling them I was planning to quit my job and return home.

I saw the tears of joy in my mom's eyes.

My dad's health hasn't been good lately, and he's been struggling to run the small supermarket by himself.

When I say "home," it's not some remote village, but a coastal city.

Xena had always refused to go back with me, saying she wasn't used to the food there. So I left my parents to find work here with her.

That evening, I met up with my friends for dinner and told them the news.

They all agreed that going back was the right decision, as my parents' health was more important.

After a few drinks, someone suddenly asked, "What about Xena? Is she willing to go back with you now?"

I was silent for a moment, then smiled bitterly. "No, we'll probably break up."

I used to think I could build a home here with Xena, and then bring my parents over later.

But now that home was gone, and I was returning to the one with my parents - the one that would never abandon me.

When I got back home, I saw Xena wearing a white dress, her black hair flowing loose, face perfectly made up, video chatting with Remy on her phone.

Remy's voice came through the speaker: "Snow, you look absolutely gorgeous. Even in a simple white dress, you look like a fairy!"

Xena giggled, covering her face coyly. "Really? You're still such a sweet talker."

I stood there silently. This "simple" white dress had cost me a month's salary when I bought it for her.

Xena turned around, still smiling, but her face fell when she saw me. She quickly told Remy, "I have to go now. I'll be there soon. Have a snack while you wait."

Xena could be all smiles and care for Remy, but she couldn't even spare a smile for me.

She looked at me with disgust, then walked past me to put on her shoes and leave.

She was starting her cold treatment again.

In the years we've been together, she often gave me the silent treatment over issues related to Remy.

Each time, I would be anxious, trying everything to please her.

This time, I wasn't nervous. I just took the groceries I had bought and went to the kitchen to make myself a late-night snack.

I had been drinking with my friends earlier and hadn't eaten much, so I was a bit hungry now.

Over the next few days, I was busy handing over my work and packing my belongings.

My things in the house were gradually disappearing, but Xena didn't notice.
