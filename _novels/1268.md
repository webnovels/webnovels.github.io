The semi-truck was a runaway missile. One second, I was rushing toward the biggest company launch of the quarter; the next, a screech of tires, an eruption of metal, and the world was just fire and twisted steel.

It was my best friend, Dustin “Dust” Rhodes, who dragged me from the wreckage. He didn't make it out unscathed; a shard of shrapnel from the explosion caught him.

Lying in the trauma bay, barely conscious, I watched him, bandaged and pale, call my fiancée, Seraphina “Sera” Lowell.

Her reply was casual, dismissive: “Alex, darling, Owen’s new game is in beta testing today. I’m running diagnostics for him. Nothing important. Gotta go!”

Dust lost it, hanging up and immediately calling his own girlfriend, Jillian “Jill” Maxwell, to beg for help finding a specialist.

“Seriously, Dust? Don’t be dramatic. Owen’s project is huge. I’m crunching his data right now!”

When I finally clawed my way back from the edge of the abyss, my eyes met Dust’s across the sterile white of the hospital room. My voice was a rasp, but the words were solid: “I want to call off the engagement.”

Dust didn't hesitate. “You cancel, I cancel.”

The panic that caused in those two women was exactly what we expected.

1

Dustin was a man of immediate action.

After confirming the cold, hard facts—which, frankly, involved little more than a replay of the call logs—he sent Jillian a succinct text: We’re done.

I was still immobilized, confined to the bed.

The doctors had finished a grueling debridement, but a few pieces of glass were lodged deep, dangerously close to vital organs. They hadn’t pulled me out of the danger zone yet. The monitoring machine beside me provided the rhythmic, unnerving soundtrack to my private war with death.

Only Dust was with me. He was patched up, too—bandages on his arm and a gash across his forehead, battle scars he earned saving my life. We were two soldiers on a retreat, one sitting, one prone, quietly licking our wounds.

“Tomorrow was the rehearsal dinner,” Dust observed, his voice flat as he glanced at the wall calendar.

My throat felt raw and burned from the smoke and fumes. I could only manage a quiet nod. The real engagement party? Clearly not happening.

Just then, my phone broke the heavy silence. Dust picked it up from the nightstand. His face immediately darkened. “It’s Sera.”

I gestured for him to answer and put it on speaker.

“Alex Montgomery!” Sera’s voice was sharp, a high-pitched spike of accusation, not concern. “What on earth is going on with you? The rehearsal dinner is in an hour! Why aren’t you here?”

I coughed twice, trying to clear my throat. “I’m in the hospital… I can’t make it. I told you yesterday.”

“Oh, that’s rich!” Her tone was filled with the kind of impatience one reserves for a spoiled child. “Just because I went with Owen Keller for a doctor’s visit yesterday, you’re pulling this petty stunt? Do you have any idea how many high-profile guests are confirmed?”

“I am genuinely in the hospital,” my voice was thin, but steady. “St. Jude’s Medical Center. Intensive Care Unit.”

“Fine. If you’re going to be like that, I’ll drive over and pick you up myself,” she threatened. “You’d better be there, or you’ll regret it.”

“I am here.”

“Alex!” Her volume ratcheted up again. “If you stand me up, you are facing consequences. The party starts in an hour, and I won’t wait!”

Dust couldn't take it anymore. He snatched the phone. “Are you deaf, Sera? He said hospital! He said ICU!”

His voice was a furious roar. “You two self-obsessed witches! Owen had a damn stomach flu and you were glued to his side. Alex almost died in a fire trap and you couldn’t be bothered to make a single follow-up call!”

Before he could finish his tirade, the line went dead. She’d hung up.

Dust was shaking, his face pale with rage. He paced the small perimeter of the room like a caged lion.

Then, his own phone rang. He glanced at the screen, a cold smirk twisting his lips. He answered, putting it on speaker without a word.

“Dustin, where are you?” Jill’s voice echoed in the room. “It’s the day I’m meeting my parents! I sent you the location! Are you intentionally missing this?”

Dust’s eyes turned to ice. “Meeting your parents? Jill, I told you last night. We are broken up. An ex is supposed to drop off the face of the earth. Vanish. You should be six feet under in my world.”

He paused, letting the silence hang heavy. “You want me to meet your parents? I think I should be buying flowers for your funeral instead.”

Jill was clearly stung. Her voice trembled. “Du-Dustin! You will regret this! Fine. You want to break up? We’re through!”

Dust ended the call without another word and efficiently blocked her number and all social media profiles. Done.

He exhaled, patting his own chest. He turned to me. “My side is settled. We’ll deal with yours when you’re stronger. Don’t let those sociopaths give you a heart attack.”

I looked at him and managed a weak, grateful smile.

My forced absence, predictably, caused Seraphina a tremendous loss of face.

She called several times. I ignored the first two.

The third time, I just silenced the phone.

The texts she sent went unread, treated like a relic of a dead past.

The final one flashed on the screen: Alex, this is completely irresponsible!

I stared at the words but didn’t reply. The planning and execution of today’s engagement party had been entirely under the command of the Lowell family. My input was never valued. I was just a functional prop in her carefully scripted life.

My own parents divorced when I was twelve and both remarried. Though their lives centered elsewhere, they’d never neglected basic care or financial support. When they heard about the crash, they instantly canceled their travel plans and were flying back.

And Sera?

She hadn't bothered to ask about my injuries. She’d ignored my clear decision to cancel the engagement. Since she chose not to believe me, why should I debase myself by explaining?

The audacity of her next move still blindsided me: she found a stand-in to complete the ceremony.

In the afternoon, during my dressing change, two young nurses were gossiping. Their conversation drifted into my sterile bubble.

“Did you hear? Sera Lowell got engaged today. Her fiancé is gorgeous! So talented, too.”

“Right? She’s so lucky. Look, they took a selfie. They look so perfect together!”

I couldn’t help but lift my head to see the photo on the nurse’s phone.

In the picture, Sera was standing beside Owen Keller, her head nestled casually on his shoulder. Her smile was blinding, radiant. They did look like a perfect match. A foregone conclusion.

My eyes suddenly stung—not from the antiseptic, but from a sharp, acidic ache deep in my chest.

“I’m sorry, did I hurt you?” The nurse changing my bandage asked with immediate concern. “I’ll be gentler.”

“It hurts a little,” I replied softly. My eyes were suddenly damp. “But I can handle it.”

Dust reached over and squeezed my wrist, a silent pledge of support.

I shook my head at him. “It’s fine. This pain is nothing.”

In truth, it hurt like hell, but compared to the searing humiliation of Sera’s public betrayal, the physical pain was merely a dull backdrop.

When we were alone, Dust tried to comfort me. “They’re both sociopathic trash, Alex. They don’t deserve your grief.”

“Oh, guess what,” he suddenly changed the subject. “That crazy Jill just messaged me. She made a pot of fish chowder! Said she made it especially for me!”

“I’m allergic to fish, a potentially lethal allergy, which I’ve told her at least twenty times! We’re broken up, is she completely unhinged?”

I couldn’t help a small laugh. “She’s not unhinged, Dust. She just never bothered to care about you. If it were Owen, she’d remember every single detail.”

Dust was silent for a moment, then nodded. “You’re right. Forget them. Let’s find something else.”

He grabbed his tablet and pulled up a streaming platform. “There’s this viral food blogger who makes people try weird specialty desserts. Their reactions are hilarious.”

He expertly navigated to the blogger’s live feed. A familiar face appeared on the screen: Jill Maxwell.

“Ma’am, please try this bespoke confection. You get to say one thing to the camera when you finish,” the host grinned.

Jill took a bite. Her face instantly twisted in disgust, but she forced a sickeningly sweet smile. “I hope the next person gets the cherry blossom flavor, especially you, Owen! I’m rooting for you always!”

She blew a heart kiss to the camera. I was about to swipe away, but Dust stopped me.

He furiously typed into the comment section: You remember Owen Keller’s favorite Cherry Blossom flavor, but you always forget your boyfriend is deathly allergic to fish!

The comment was immediately swallowed by the flood of other messages. I patted Dust’s shoulder. “Our lives are better without them in it.”

He agreed, but the streamer’s viewers had already recognized Jill.

“Isn’t that the Maxwell heiress? No way, seeing her here!”

“That guy she’s rooting for is so lucky!”

“My Lady, your loyal servant has been waiting. How may I be of service?”

The digital commotion made Jill an instant viral sensation.

Soon after, Owen posted a picture on his social media: Cherry blossom dessert received. Happiness is manifesting your dreams.

The photo showed a plate of the elegant pink dessert, and sitting across the table, beaming at the camera, was Jill.

Dust snorted with contempt. “Look at that pathetic lapdog.”

I had to laugh out loud. Dust was right. They were both pathetic, orbiting around Owen, never considering who the real winner was.

Maybe no one.

Seraphina and Owen’s makeshift engagement ceremony should have marked the end of my relationship.

Once I was discharged, I planned to meticulously return everything she had ever given me. She’d bought me several expensive items during our time, but I wasn't the type to hold onto a single thing. A clean, clinical end was always my preference.

Forty-eight hours later, my condition stabilized, and I was moved to a standard room.

The attending physician came in for his rounds, looking over my chart and shaking his head.

“Mr. Montgomery, you are one lucky man,” he said, looking at the X-rays. “That piece of glass was less than an inch from your heart. Any deeper, and we wouldn't be having this conversation.”

He closed the file, his expression serious. “Going forward, you need extreme emotional control. No excitement, no profound sadness. Focus on rest.”

“Thank you, Doctor.” I nodded.

The doctor had barely left when my phone rang. It was Sera’s office line. I’d forgotten to block that one. After a moment of hesitation, I answered.

“You saw the photos online, I assume?” Sera’s voice came through the receiver, still devoid of any real concern. “If Owen hadn't stepped up that day, the ceremony would have been a disaster!

“You’ve had your little fit. Time to come home. Stop acting like a child!”

I gave a dry, humorless laugh. “Sera, I am not coming back.”

“What exactly do you want?” Her voice jumped in pitch. “I’ve already explained to my parents that despite your absence, we are honoring the engagement!

“If you continue this nonsense, we are really done!”

I took a deep breath. “Sera, I am lying in a hospital. This made the news. A little basic care would have told you that.”

A cold laugh came from the other end. “You’re just making up a hospital story to retaliate because I accompanied Owen to the doctor, aren’t you?”

“Fine. Tell me, what hospital? What floor? Who is your attending physician?”

I answered calmly. “St. Jude’s, Surgical Ward, Room 24. Come now. My doctor is still on the floor.”

“You wait right there. I’m coming.” She hung up.

Sera was the Design Director at the company. There was no way she didn't know about one of her top designers being hospitalized. She’d simply been too busy playing wife to Owen to read any internal notices, entirely unaware that I was right under her nose.

Half an hour later, a commotion started in the hallway. Sera had arrived, and Owen was with her.

I leaned back on the pillows, eyes closed, listening to the overly dramatic gasps and cheers outside.

“Oh my God, they really are the perfect couple!”

“Look at them. Are they here to flaunt their happiness? I’m so jealous!”

“Designer Keller is even better looking in person. Director Lowell is so lucky!”

I opened my eyes, a sardonic smile playing on my lips.

These people probably didn't realize that the “fiancé” was merely a last-minute substitute.

But thinking about it now, I was the redundant one. They had publicly announced their engagement. They were, technically, the legitimate couple now.

Sera gave only the briefest acknowledgments to her colleagues’ compliments, while Owen wore a smug, entitled expression. His voice was loud, laced with a practiced charm.

“Thanks for taking care of Sera. I ordered coffee for the whole floor. It’ll be up soon.”

“Wow, Designer Keller is not only talented but so thoughtful!”

Amidst the chorus of flattery, they appeared in my doorway.

Owen had his arm possessively around Sera’s waist, his eyes full of a childish triumph.

Sera clearly faltered when she saw me actually lying in the bed.

Her eyes scanned the room, and when they landed on the private suite, her brow instantly furrowed.

“Do you know how tight the company’s medical resource budget is? You’re hogging a single room just to make a statement?”

“A statement to you?” I looked up, my eyes filled with cold mockery. “Who are you, Sera, that I would go to this much trouble just to spite you?”

“Alex Montgomery!” she raised her voice.

“I’m right here. No need to shout,” I said calmly. “We are over. He is now your fiancé. Did you come here specifically to assert your dominance?”

“Well then, I wish you both a happy and miserable life together.”

Sera’s face went rigid with fury. “How dare you insult us?

“Apologize! Now!”

I met her stare. “Apologize? Not a chance.”

Sera was shaking with rage. Owen quickly pulled her back. “Don’t get upset, Sera. Alex is sick. He’s emotional. Don’t pay him any mind.”

“He’s doing this on purpose!” Sera glared at me. “Who is your attending physician? He’s clearly complicit in this elaborate act!”

I looked at her coolly. “Sera, have you had enough? You’re not my doctor, so why all the questions?”

“I have agreed to break up with you. Why can't you leave me alone? Dating two men at once—doesn't that make you sick?”

Sera suddenly lifted her hand to strike my face.

I was ready. I leaned to the side, dodging the blow, and at the same time pressed the call button on the bedside unit. As she recoiled in shock, I lifted my hand and delivered a sharp, open-handed slap across her face.

The crisp crack echoed through the room.

Owen stood wide-eyed, then rushed to Sera’s side, tenderly touching her cheek. “How could you do that? Sera came here out of concern for you, and you hit her!”

“She threw the first punch,” I said, shaking my hand and staring at them. “I didn’t invite either of you.”

Sera’s lip trembled. The red imprint of my fingers was clear on her pale skin.

“Sera, are we clear now?” I pointed to the door. “Get out. I don’t want to see you again.”
