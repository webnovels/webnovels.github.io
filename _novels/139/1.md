Luna had trouble producing enough breast milk. Our mom, always favoring her, eagerly brought me over to nurse the baby as soon as she was out of the incubator.

But Luna screamed hysterically: "Aria, get out of here!"

She hurled various items at me, including a bottle that broke against my head. Blood trickled down my temple.

I retreated behind the door, wincing in pain, my expression darkening.

Mom rushed forward and grabbed Luna's arm. "What's going on? Did Aria do something wrong?"

Luna glared at me with bloodshot eyes, as if I were her mortal enemy. She snarled through gritted teeth: "She's trying to steal my baby!"

"Daisy is my daughter! No one can take her away! She's a kidnapper, I'm calling the police!"

Her eyes were filled with hatred. For a moment, her face overlapped with the twisted, terrifying expression of the Luna who had killed me in my previous life.

A chill ran down my spine as I suddenly realized - I wasn't the only one who had been reborn. So had she.

But in the previous life, she was the one who switched the babies, not me! How dare she call me a kidnapper? Ridiculous!

Luna and I are twins, but our mom has always favored her.

For the first thirty years of her life, everything went smoothly for Luna. After graduating from a mediocre college, she married into an elite family and gave birth to an adorable daughter, living a happy and prosperous life. Meanwhile, I had a child with a congenital heart defect and spent all my savings seeking medical treatment.

Who would have thought that later on, the elite family Luna married into would go bankrupt?

Without a substantial family fortune to rely on, her child grew up to be spoiled and incompetent. Soon, mother and daughter ended up homeless, forced to scavenge for food. My child, on the other hand, was raised well by me. She graduated from a top university, excelled in her career, and with the wealth I had diligently saved, we quickly acquired several villas and even opened our own studio.

While Luna was picking through garbage, I was traveling the world.

On my 40th birthday, Luna suddenly burst in, wielding a weapon and lunging at me with eyes full of hatred.

She stabbed me viciously several times, then turned to my daughter with a pained expression: "Sweetheart, I'm your real mother! I'm your real mother! How could you not recognize me?"

It was only then that I learned the truth - years ago, Luna had switched our babies out of fear of being cast aside by her wealthy in-laws!

The spoiled child she raised was actually mine, while the one with the heart condition was her own daughter!

Luna plunged the knife into my heart, her eyes wild with madness: "Aria, you stole my life! All of this should have been mine!"

Her twisted expression merged with the Luna before me now.

I laughed coldly inside, but kept my face expressionless. "Forget it, Mom," I said. "If Luna doesn't want me to nurse the baby, there's no point in pushing it. I'll leave."

As I turned to go, I heard Luna let out a sigh of relief.

She probably thought her happiness was within reach now.

After all, in the previous life, her daughter had grown up to be obedient, talented, and filial. All Luna had to do was enjoy the fruits of my labor.

But little did she know...

That true heiress had died of heart failure at just ten years old.

The girl who came after was a child I had adopted from an orphanage after the real Daisy passed away.
