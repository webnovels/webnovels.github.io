On the day of discharge, my soon-to-be ex-husband Jack came to pick us up.

To my disbelief, before my personal belongings were even loaded, my mom had already put Luna's things in the trunk.

Even Jack was being overly attentive: "Luna, you get in first. The wind is strong, don't catch a chill."

Looking at this man before me, I felt nothing but disgust. I couldn't help but laugh coldly: "What's the meaning of this?"

My mom, noticing my expression, hurriedly came over to take my suitcase. "Oh, look at my memory! I forgot to tell you!" she said. "You see, your sister has decided to divorce the Ling family for some reason. You know she got married right after graduation and doesn't have a job or anywhere to go. So I thought, why not let Luna stay at your place for now!"

Luna sat in the car, smiling at me: "Aria, I'm still recovering from childbirth. You wouldn't refuse me, would you?"

The two of them were trying to emotionally blackmail me.

However, my heart had been hardened by the despair of my previous life. I immediately shook my head firmly: "No, I don't agree."

My mom's face fell, but before she could say anything, Jack spoke up: "Aria, how can you be like this?"

"Postpartum recovery is so important for women. I know you've never liked your sister, but you can't joke around with her health!" Jack said with a disappointed look. "I always thought you were a kind girl. Who would have thought you couldn't even accommodate your own twin sister..."

Looking at his disgusting face, I couldn't help but recall my previous life. When I was taking our child around seeking medical treatment, he was fooling around with his assistant. After divorcing me, he married that assistant just two months later.

In the years that followed, although he and his mistress didn't become extremely wealthy, they lived a comfortable middle-class life without facing any real consequences.

Given a second chance at life, I was determined not to let him off so easily.

An idea struck me. Instead of refusing outright, I said: "If you want to stay at my place, that's fine. But the rent is $2000 a month, not a penny less."

Luna's face changed: "You're taking advantage of the situation!"

My mom pulled her aside: "It's fine, she's just being stubborn. She won't really make you pay. Let's move in first and figure it out later. Don't argue with her."

Luna gave me a dirty look before sitting down to comfort her fussy daughter.
