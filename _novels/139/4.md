I named my biological daughter Sunny, completely different from her name in the previous life.

When Luna heard the baby was called Sunny, she was taken aback: "How come? Shouldn't your child be called..." She caught herself mid-sentence and coughed, swallowing the rest of her words.

But the suspicious look she gave me spoke volumes.

I accepted her scrutiny openly. Even if she knew I had been reborn, so what? This time, I hadn't interfered with her choices at all!

Her child was still called Daisy, though the surname had changed from Zhou to Shao.

And I remembered that Daisy's first health crisis in my previous life was about to happen right on schedule.

Although, the circumstances were subtly different from what had happened before.
