Hearing that I was too weak to shift into a beast form from fright, the envoy and other guards were quite shocked.

 They didn’t shift either but instead tossed me onto a wooden sled, planning to drag me along.

Watching that sled with no wheels, even after being reborn, I was still amazed by the primitive world’s backward production capabilities.

Perhaps seeing my weak constitution, they didn’t even bother to tie me up.

So I lay comfortably on the wooden sled, closed my eyes, and began to contact my Nation-Building Tech System.

In my previous life, I didn't even realize there was a gun inside the system until I was dying.

 This time, the moment I entered the system space, I was utterly stunned.

There was everything: rice that yielded a thousand kilograms per mu, basic medical knowledge, craft instruction books, and of course, plenty of guns and ammunition…

The shelves were packed full. Any one item, pulled out at random, would be revolutionary for this world!

My heart pounded, then surged with excitement. With these things, building my own empire wouldn’t be difficult. 

It could at least vastly improve my quality of life! No more living like a savage, like in my last life!

I couldn't help but want to grab my short-sighted cousin, Brittany, and beat her senseless. 

So many treasures, and in her previous life, she was like a toddler given a fortune, unable to use any of it, obsessed only with being beloved. What a waste!

Just as my mind raced, commotion and screams erupted around me.

I instantly opened my eyes. The moment I did, I froze.

Breathing on me was a colossal beast, half a story tall, covered in hard, gleaming armor. 

Its mouthparts dripped with saliva, exhaling a foul, fishy odor. I was barely half a meter from it, face-to-face. What in the world was this thing?!

The beastkin guards who had been watching me scrambled away in sheer terror, “Insect-beast! The insect-beast is here! Run!”

It was an insect-beast, the beastkin’s natural enemy, something I’d only heard legends of in my previous life but never seen.

“Roar—!”

The insect-beast roared at me, its foul saliva dripping all over me.

The next second, a gunshot rang out.

“Bang—!”

The colossal body of the insect-beast crashed down before me, kicking up clouds of dust.

I whistled softly. Gotta say, the AK47 is just so good. And the moment I picked it up, I instantly mastered all its usage methods.

System-issued, always top-tier.

The scattered beastkin, seeing the insect-beast subdued by me, stared in shock, their faces filled with disbelief, almost afraid to approach me.

I jumped off the wooden sled. Finn, the envoy, looked at me, a mix of shock and joy on his face:

“How did you do that?!”

Soon, greed crept onto his face. “What are you standing around for?! Grab her! Tie her up quickly! We must get her secret!”

Laughable. Gun in hand, I rule this place.

I immediately aimed the AK47 at Finn’s leg and shot him.

“Aarghh—!”

Finn let out a sharp howl, clutching a bloody hole in his leg, his face filled with terror. “What is this?! What is this?! By the Mother Goddess Raynes, I was wrong! Please, forgive me!”

The beastkin guards who had been about to seize me were terrified. 

They instantly abandoned Finn and tried to flee.

I fired a few shots into the sky. “Who dares to run? I’ll kill them directly!”

All the beastkin became utterly silent.

I nodded in satisfaction. A joke. If I let them go, who would boil water, cook, and hunt on the way to the city?

I ran up to the terrified envoy and pressed the gun to his head. He was stunned and terrified by this unseen “divine artifact,” his mouth trembling.

“Tell me everything about your Wolf Cloud City, or you’ll end up like that insect-beast.” I pointed to the thoroughly dead insect-beast nearby.

Finn immediately nodded, spilling the beans on everything, like a dam breaking.
