After Elise Cullen regained her memory, the very first thing she did was call her butler, Duncan Jamison.

"Duncan, arrange for someone to pick me up and take me home immediately!"

The moment Duncan heard her familiar voice, he was so overwhelmed that tears streamed down his face.

"Ms. Cullen, where have you been all this time?" he asked emotionally. "You have no idea how desperately Mr. John and Mr. Cyrus have been searching for you these past few years. They were nearly driven mad with worry."

Elise frowned, suppressing the heavy emotions rising in her chest.

"It's a long story, and the situation is complicated. I'll explain everything once I'm back."

After hanging up, she let out a long, weary sigh.

She had once been the beloved daughter of the wealthiest family in the country. Several years ago, her private jet had crashed in the mountains. Although she survived the accident and was rescued by a stranger, she suffered a serious head injury that left her with complete memory loss.

She had wandered the streets alone for a long time, without a name or identity, until Alexander Bennett, the CEO of Bennett Corporation, took her into his home. Not long after, he proposed to her in front of everyone.

At the time, she could not understand why someone like Alexander, who was admired throughout Birkstone's financial world for his looks, power, and status, and considered the ideal match by every socialite in the city, would choose to marry a woman who had once lived like a beggar on the streets.

It was only later that she learned the truth. Alexander's heart had always belonged to his childhood friend, Alicia Yale.

Before he could confess his feelings, Alicia had eloped with a poor man and left Birkstone behind without ever returning.

Since Alicia had chosen a man who was beneath her, Alexander retaliated by marrying a woman he considered just as cheap.

During the years she lived without her memories, Elise had no one to turn to. When a man as brilliant as Alexander appeared in her life, she naturally fell in love with him. She later gave birth to his son.

Throughout those years, Alexander remained cold and emotionally distant. Their son, whom she had carried for ten months and nearly died giving birth to because of severe bleeding, ended up inheriting his temperament. He showed no warmth toward her, nor did he ever seem close to her.

The three of them rarely exchanged more than a few words each day. Elise had once assumed that both of them were simply naturally reserved.

However, everything changed when Alicia returned to Birkstone.

Rumor had it that Alicia had struggled with hardship and could no longer endure the life she had chosen. That was why she came back.

From the moment she returned, the ever-indifferent Alexander softened in a way Elise had never witnessed. For the first time, his eyes held a warmth and gentleness that had never been meant for her. Her son, Aaron Bennett, also began to follow Alicia around constantly.

Elise's recent hospitalization was a direct result of Alicia's actions. One day, Alicia had casually mentioned that she would love to see how someone with a fear of heights would react to skydiving. 

Aaron had then blindfolded Elise under the pretense of giving her a surprise, taken her onto a plane, and pushed her out from over ten thousand feet in the air.

Elise had nearly lost her life, but the shock of that moment had brought all her memories back.

During her hospitalization, neither Alexander nor Aaron had come to see her. Even when she was discharged, she had handled all the procedures and packed her belongings by herself.

As she stepped outside the hospital and was about to hail a cab, her eyes suddenly landed on a familiar black Bentley. It was Alexander's car. A moment later, the door opened.

Alexander, Alicia, and Aaron stepped out and slowly walked toward her under the curious gazes of everyone around them.

The striking pair, Alexander and Alicia, had always turned heads. They were even more eye-catching now that they were accompanied by a five-year-old boy whose delicate features made him look like a porcelain doll.

To outsiders, they looked like a stunning and picture-perfect family.

But to Elise, the scene before her was nothing short of cruel.

Alicia held Aaron's hand and smiled in a way that was both sweet and mocking as she greeted her.

"Elise, are you feeling better? I heard you were being discharged today, so I brought Alexander and little Aaron to pick you up."

Even a fool could hear the pride in her tone. The message was clear—if she hadn't spoken up, neither Alexander nor Aaron would have bothered to show up today.

Although Elise had been in the hospital, she had still managed to learn a great deal about them through the news.

Alexander, who had always been devoted to his work, had canceled numerous meetings just to please Alicia. He had been showering her with luxury goods and jewelry, doing everything he could to make her smile.

Aaron had always been exceptionally bright and was even praised as a young genius. Despite his young age, he had already created several patented inventions. Instead of sharing any of them with his own mother, he had used them all to make Alicia happy.

Elise understood what Alicia was trying to do, and she had no intention of playing along. She turned away and tried to walk past her without saying a word.

Alicia suddenly stumbled and fell from the steps.

Alexander rushed over from a short distance away. He quickly helped Alicia to her feet and immediately shielded her behind him.

"Elise! What do you think you're doing?"

Before Elise could say a word, Alicia quickly spoke up.

"It's not Elise's fault," she said softly. "She's still upset about the skydiving incident. That really was my mistake, so it's understandable that she's angry."

She bit her lip and fought back tears, looking utterly wronged. The sight of her in such a fragile state made both Alexander and Aaron instantly feel distressed.

Alexander's expression was cold, as if he found it tiresome to say even one extra word to Elise. 

Meanwhile, Aaron sternly scolded her, "Why are you still upset about that? You spend all day doing housework at home anyway. I just wanted you to experience something different and fun."

Then, he added, "I was the one who tricked you into skydiving and pushed you out of the plane. It had nothing to do with Alicia. Stop being so unreasonable."

Elise stood frozen, at a complete loss for words. She turned to Alexander, hoping for a shred of understanding, but his eyes were cold and emotionless.

"Do not hurt Alicia again. If you do, you won't be able to bear the consequences," he said firmly.

He had always been detached and indifferent, as though nothing could ever truly affect him. When it came to Elise, he was even more dismissive.

No matter what she endured, he believed she would always pick herself back up and return to him without complaint.

But this time, he had shown genuine rage for the sake of Alicia.

Elise looked at them and felt completely exhausted. She no longer had the strength to explain herself.

So be it. She would be leaving soon anyway.

The Cullen family was the wealthiest in the world. Their estate was as secure as a fortress, guarded around the clock. The Bennetts were not even qualified to see her. From now on, she would never lay eyes on those two again.

Alicia stepped forward with a gentle smile, trying to smooth things over. "I'm fine. It's just a small fall. We came here today specifically to pick up Elise from the hospital, so let's all head back together," she said as she reached out and tried to take Elise's hand.

Elise simply shook her off. 

Just as she was about to step forward, a voice suddenly called out from behind her in surprise.

"Ms. Cullen, what are you doing here?"

All of them turned around in confusion. Elise stared at the newcomer for a long moment before she finally remembered who he was.

She had never been to Birkstone before, so logically, no one there should have recognized her.

However, this man had once worked on a project and had tried to win over her brother, John Cullen, for investment. That was why he had flattered her for some time and was able to recognize her now.

Aaron's face twisted with disdain. "You must have the wrong person. Who are you calling Ms. Cullen? She's just a helper in our house."

Elise froze. Aaron's words struck her like a bolt of lightning, and the pain was so intense it tore through her entire body.

The man behind her also hesitated, thinking he truly must have made a mistake. After offering a hasty and embarrassed apology, he quickly left.

Aaron looked up at her again. "With your background, you're not even worthy of being my mother. Only Alicia is good enough," he said in a tone disturbingly calm for a five-year-old.

Alicia blushed and tugged his hand. "Aaron, don't say that."

Alexander remained silent. He didn't speak up to defend Elise at all.

When they arrived at the car, Aaron immediately ran to the front passenger seat and blocked Elise from approaching. "Alicia gets carsick, so she'll sit in the front."

He then took Alicia's hand and got into the car. "Alicia, sit tight. I've set everything up for you."

Elise had never even considered sitting in the front seat. Whenever the three of them went out together, she always sat in the back to keep Aaron company.

She had never expected her own son to act this way for Alicia's sake.

The front passenger seat was decorated with flowers and snacks Alicia liked. There was even a pink sticker that read "Only for Alicia".

Alexander and Aaron were neat freaks. They never ate in the car and disliked such sentimental decorations. But for Alicia, they made exceptions again and again.

When they arrived at the Bennett residence, Alicia went upstairs with the three of them.

By the door, her pink slippers were neatly placed alongside Alexander's and Aaron's shoes.

Alexander took the initiative to explain, "Alicia will be staying with us for a while."

Perhaps sensing that Elise might object, Aaron immediately chimed in, "I begged Alicia to stay with us. She helps me with homework and teaches me how to draw."

Elise looked at the three of them with a calm she had never shown before.

"Suit yourselves," she said, then turned and walked straight to her room.

Her unusual composure left both Alexander and Aaron slightly stunned.

For a fleeting moment, they sensed something had changed in her. However, neither of them could quite place what it was.

During dinner, Aaron kept piling food onto Alicia's plate. "Alicia, try this! My mom may be useless at everything else, but she's amazing at cooking and doing chores!"

Elise's hand trembled as she held her utensils. It felt like something had split open inside her chest.
The three of them laughed and chatted as if she were the outsider at her own table.

While dishing food, Alicia accidentally dumped the scraps from her plate into Elise's soup bowl.
Anyone with eyes could tell she had done it on purpose.

Elise had spent three whole hours making that soup. The preparation was tedious and the ingredients required meticulous cleaning.

Each time she made it, her fingers would wrinkle from soaking and scrubbing. 

Alexander and Aaron were notoriously picky eaters, but they both loved her soup.

Even though it was exhausting, she had always done it willingly.

She would never again allow an outsider to trample all over her hard work, especially now that she had regained all her memories. She was no longer that weak, spineless woman they could push around.

She set down her fork and looked at Alicia with obvious displeasure. "Ms. Yale, ever since I got out of the hospital, you've been coming at me again and again. What exactly do you want?"

Alicia froze, looking at her with a face full of feigned innocence. In the next second, tears began to pour down her cheeks like a broken dam. "I didn't…" she whimpered.

The moment she cried, Alexander's expression shifted.

He shot Elise a cold glare, as if she was the one constantly in the wrong. "Was that really necessary? It's just a bowl of soup. You can make another one."

Aaron jumped down from his chair and gave her a hard shove. "You're a terrible person! I don't ever want to drink your soup again!"

Elise stumbled backward, digging her nails deep into her palms as bitterness surged through her chest.

There would be no next time. No matter how much they begged, they would never taste her soup again.

That night, thunder rumbled through the sky. Elise jolted awake from a nightmare, drenched in cold sweat.

Her mouth was dry. She got out of bed, staggering slightly as she made her way to the door to get some water.

Just as she reached the hallway, she heard Aaron's soft, comforting voice.

"Alicia, don't be scared. Daddy and I are right here with you."

The door to the next room was slightly ajar.

Elise stood silently in the hallway, watching through the crack. 

Aaron lay nestled in Alicia's arms, wrapping his small hands tightly around her. Beside them, Alexander was holding Alicia's hand with equal tenderness. 

They looked every bit like a perfect little family, while she was the unwanted extra.

Elise let out a bitter laugh and turned away.

A few days later, Birkstone hosted a grand auction, and Alexander was invited to attend.

Elise had never been interested in auctions and had no intention of going this time either.

Unexpectedly, Alicia insisted that she accompany her, saying it would be a good opportunity to broaden her horizons.

With Alicia making the suggestion, both Alexander and Aaron naturally sided with her and insisted that Elise come with them.

When they arrived at the auction, most guests had already gathered. Alexander's close friends in the social circle were present, and the moment they saw Elise, their faces darkened with disdain.

Owing to her background, Alexander's friends had always looked down on her. Over the years, they made no effort to hide their contempt, whether in front of her or behind her back.

Now that she had shown up with Alicia, their scorn became even more obvious.

"What is Elise doing here? Does she even understand any of this?"

"Just look at her. It doesn't matter how expensive her clothes are, she still gives off that same cheap vibe."

"Exactly. Alicia and Alexander are a much better match."

They flattered Alicia as if she were royalty, while completely humiliating Elise in front of everyone.

However, Alexander remained silent through it all, as if none of it concerned him.

Elise could only laugh bitterly to herself. He had been this indifferent for years, and somehow, she had never truly noticed. She used to think he was just naturally cold and distant.

The auction commenced with a painting entitled "Radiance", reputed to be the final work of a famously reclusive artist whose pieces were highly esteemed in the art world. Given its significance as his concluding masterpiece prior to retirement, the opening bid was set at five million dollars.

Alicia admired the painting and said, "Aaron's birthday is coming up. I'll buy this as a gift for him."

Alexander gave a faint smile and a slight nod, silently approving her decision.

Elise glanced at the painting, then let out a soft laugh. "This painting is a fake."

Alicia looked at her in surprise. "How do you know?"

Elise remained calm. "The original was purchased by a wealthy heiress five years ago and has been kept in her private collection ever since. It's never been loaned out."

The people around them let out mocking laughs.

"She talks like she actually knows something."

"If the real one's in a private collection, how would she even know what it looks like? Is she claiming she's the heiress now? What a joke."

Aaron tugged on Elise's arm with clear annoyance. "If you don't know anything, can you just stop talking? This is really embarrassing."

She looked down at Aaron, only to see his little face flushed with frustration as he subtly scooted closer to Alicia.

Alicia smiled and comforted him. "Elise hasn't attended many exhibitions, so of course she hasn't seen many works. It's normal not to understand. Don't get upset with your mother, Aaron."

Her words dripped with superiority and barely concealed her mockery.

Alexander stayed silent, but thoughtfully draped his coat over Alicia's shoulders. "Are you cold? If it gets colder, I'll have someone turn up the heat."

He never spoke for Elise because he simply didn't care about her. If that was how it was, there was no reason for her to worry about them.

In the end, Alicia bought the fake painting for a whopping ten million dollars.

Halfway through the auction, Elise grew bored and got up to go to the restroom. On her way there, she unexpectedly ran into the very group of people who had never been kind to her.

They took advantage of their friendship with Alexander to freely criticize her.

"I can't believe you're still here. You've got some nerve."

"Anyone with a shred of dignity would've stepped aside and filed for divorce the moment Alicia came back. How can you shamelessly cling to the title of Mrs. Bennett?"

"Exactly. Look at you. You're nothing but a beggar. What do you have that could possibly compare to Alicia?"

Elise stared at their faces. Their arrogance and cruelty were so utterly ridiculous that she found it almost laughable.

Alicia had been the one to leave. The title of Mrs. Bennett had never been something Elise took by force. What gave these people the right to accuse her?

Unwilling to waste her time or energy on them, she decided to walk away without a word.

However, they grew bolder, stepping forward to block her path.

"Are you deaf? We're talking to you."

"Stop pretending you didn't hear us. You are not worthy of being with Alex. The kind of woman who should be by his side is someone like Alicia. She's accomplished, graceful, and stands out in any crowd with her charm and poise."

"Exactly. A woman with Alicia's talent is far more suited to be Mrs. Bennett. Alex has always loved classic fine art, and Alicia just happens to be exceptionally skilled at it. That's why he's been so fond of her for so many years. You probably don't even know the first thing about art."

As the last comment fell, one of them retrieved a painting they had clearly brought in advance and placed it in front of Elise.

"This is the piece that made Alex fall for Alicia. Tell me, do you even understand what you're looking at?"

Elise turned her gaze toward the painting, and a deep, unfamiliar emotion slowly stirred in her eyes.

The longer she studied it, the more familiar it felt.

Then, in a sudden flash of realization, she remembered. She had painted this as her graduation project back in university. It had only been a casual sketch back then, so she had never given it much thought.

She had loved painting since childhood, but being a member of the prominent Cullen family, she was rarely allowed to show her face in public. Most of her award-winning work had been submitted under a pseudonym, and she had never personally appeared at any exhibitions.

Over the years, her pieces had gained wide recognition. Many people had tried to imitate her style, and one of the more notable copycats had even gained some fame.

She hadn't expected that so-called talented imitator to be Alicia.

However, the greatest irony of all was that Alexander had fallen for Alicia because of this very painting.

When it came down to it, the person he had truly fallen for was Elise.

Fate was truly absurd. It almost felt as though everything had already been predestined.

She let out a soft, ironic laugh.

The people around her immediately reacted with displeasure.

"What are you laughing at?"

She simply shook her head and said nothing more. There was no longer any need to explain.

After the auction ended, Elise chose not to leave with the others. Instead, she quietly hailed a cab on her own.

Alicia found it a little strange and instinctively took a step forward, but Aaron stopped her by grabbing her hand. "Don't bother with her, Alicia. Let's just go back together."

Alexander opened the car door and got in without even glancing in Elise's direction.

That was fine. Elise hadn't known how to explain herself anyway.

She instructed the driver to take her to the law firm.

The day her memories returned, she had already made an appointment and asked the lawyer to prepare the divorce agreement.

And now, she had come to collect it.

… 

On Aaron's birthday, Alexander hosted an extravagant celebration in his honor.

Aaron stood before the crowd to cut the cake. To everyone's surprise, he handed the very first slice to Alicia.

Alicia accepted it with delight and presented the painting she had won at the auction as his birthday gift, just as promised.

"Alicia has truly spared no expense. That is an exceptionally lavish gift for a child."

"She knows what she's doing. Haven't you noticed how fond Aaron is of her now? He's clearly more affectionate with her than with his own mother. Anyone unaware of the situation might assume she's his biological mother."

"There's a clear difference between Alicia and Elise. Alicia's a poised and polished heiress, while Elise is barely more than a stray. Aaron might be young, but kids pick up on more than we think. If I were him, I'd choose Alicia as my mother too."

Amid the quiet discussions, Alicia approached Elise with a composed smile.

"Elise, may I ask what gift you brought for Aaron? I hope it's not just another toy. Aaron isn't like most children, and let's be honest, your background is worlds apart from his. You really shouldn't impose your way of thinking on him. If his classmates find out you gave him something so thoughtless, it might embarrass him."

Elise smiled without a word. She quietly retrieved a gift box from behind her and placed it in Aaron's hands.

Inside was a divorce agreement, with a specific clause stating that she had relinquished custody of the child.

This time, the gift she had prepared was freedom for both Aaron and Alexander.

Before handing over the divorce agreement, Elise had imagined countless possible reactions. However, she had not expected Aaron to toss the gift aside without even opening it.

"I don't care what she brought. It's not like she could give me anything good," he said.

Elise looked at the gift box lying forgotten in the corner. A bitter smile tugged at her lips, but she said nothing.

It was alright. One day, they would understand.

Although it was supposed to be Aaron's birthday party, everything from the decorations to the food had clearly been chosen to suit Alicia's tastes. From morning until now, Elise hadn't had a sip of water or a single bite to eat. Even when the cake was finally served, no one thought to offer her a slice.

She glanced toward the buffet, hoping to find something to eat, but every dish was seafood. She happened to be allergic. 

After all these years, she still wasn't sure if Alexander or Aaron even knew that. Even if they did, they probably wouldn't care.

After hours without food, Elise felt dizzy and weak. She had low blood sugar and could barely hold on. To avoid fainting in front of everyone, she took a bite of a cookie that sat beside the cake.

Just then, Aaron ran up to her and slammed into her stomach. His face was flushed with anger.

"Who said you could touch that? Alicia made it for me!"

Elise had not expected such fury over a bite of cookie.

Pain shot through her abdomen, and she lost her balance, falling heavily against the champagne tower behind her. With a loud crash, the entire tower collapsed. She fell into the broken glass, soaked in wine and blood.

The flying shards also cut Alicia's cheek. Panic immediately spread across Alexander and Aaron's faces.

"Alicia, are you hurt anywhere?" Alexander asked.

"Daddy, we have to take Alicia to the hospital now!" Aaron urged.

Without hesitation, they rushed off with Alicia.

No one spared a glance at Elise, who lay crumpled on the floor like discarded debris after a storm.

The people around her stared with fear, disgust, and pity.

Even though she had long understood how heartless Alexander and Aaron were, feeling it again so clearly made her heart ache sharply. It felt like something was squeezing her chest, making it hard to breathe.

She didn't know if the physical pain or the emotional pain was worse.

The pain was overwhelming, and she lay there for a long time. Eventually, she forced herself up and called for an ambulance.

When she woke, she was in the hospital. Her arms bore stitches. She could only imagine how much worse it would have been if she had arrived any later.

The IV drip was empty, and no nurse had come to change it. She struggled to sit up and pressed the call button several times.

After ten minutes with no response, she saw blood flowing back into the tube. She had no choice but to remove it herself. She struggled to stand and walked toward the door.

Just then, a nurse rushed by on her way upstairs. Elise stopped her and asked what was happening.

The nurse looked frustrated. "You won't believe it. Mr. Bennett from the VIP floor called every doctor and nurse on this level to take care of Ms. Yale. His son insisted she have the best care, so this is what happened."

She shook her head. "They are spoiling Ms. Yale far too much. The injury is small. It would have healed by now if she had come a little later."

The nurse looked at Elise's wounds. "You are seriously hurt. Why is no one taking care of you? Where's your family?"

Elise gave a faint, bitter smile. "The Mr. Bennett and his son you mentioned are actually my husband and my child."

The nurse seemed flustered by her earlier comments and quickly apologized.

Elise simply shook her head calmly. It didn't matter anymore. Soon, they would no longer be her family.

That night, she lay in bed, unable to sleep. Her phone kept lighting up with message notifications from Alicia.

She had sent dozens of photos and messages, all showing off how gentle and doting Alexander and Aaron were toward her.

Alexander was shown personally peeling apples for her, while Aaron lay beside her, reading her stories. Anything she wanted was delivered to her without her having to ask.

At the end of the messages, there was a video.

In the video, Alicia held up a small cake and sweetly told Aaron, "It's not past midnight yet, so your birthday isn't over. Go ahead, make a wish."

Alexander stood to the side, watching the two of them fondly.

Aaron closed his eyes and pressed his palms together in front of his chest.

"I wish Daddy could be with the person he truly loves. I wish Alicia could be my mommy," he said.

When the video ended, Elise felt her heart go cold.

All these years, she had poured herself out for that father and son, giving everything she could without hesitation. And yet, in their eyes, she had become nothing more than an unnecessary presence.

What did her years of devotion even count for?

During her entire stay in the hospital, neither of them had visited. They had been too preoccupied with Alicia to even spare her a glance.

Elise had never realized they were capable of such cruelty.

That night, she went up to the rooftop alone.

From there, the moon looked clear and serene, just like it had from the top floor of Cullen Manor, where she used to sit alone, bathing in moonlight.

It had been days since she called Duncan. Why hadn't anyone come?

A breeze picked up, and the chill in the air prompted her to turn back toward her room. Just as she did, Alicia appeared behind her.

She stood in the doorway, blocking Elise's path and slowly forcing her back toward the rooftop's edge.

Alicia smiled and asked mockingly, "Out here all by yourself? Didn't Alex and Aaron come to keep you company?"

She gave a soft laugh and added, "Oh, right. They went out to buy me cheesecake. Of course they wouldn't have time for you. Elise, honestly, I don't understand. Things have already reached this point. Why are you still clinging to them? Do you really think you can win against me?"

Elise had no desire to argue, nor to compete for affection. She stepped forward to push past her, but Alicia grabbed her arm and refused to let go.

"Don't be in such a hurry. Let's make a bet," Alicia said with a smirk. "Let's see who Alex and Aaron would choose between the two of us. If I lose, I promise I'll never appear in front of you again. But if you lose, you must divorce Alexander immediately."

Before Elise could respond, Alicia gave a signal.

A man who had been hiding behind the door rushed out.

Since Elise was already weakened and injured, she had no strength to resist. Within moments, her wrists were bound.

Everything had been orchestrated by Alicia. She had deliberately sent Alexander and Aaron away so the kidnapper could take both her and Elise at once.

Elise had no idea what the point of it all was. Even she could see that, in their hearts, Alicia meant far more to them than she ever did.

Maybe Alicia just wanted her to give up once and for all, but what she didn't know was that Elise already had.

After receiving the kidnapper's call, Alexander quickly rushed over with Aaron in tow.

The moment they saw Alicia bound and gagged, both of them were so shaken their eyes turned bloodshot.

"Let them go, or I'll make you wish you were never born!" Alexander threatened.

The kidnapper sneered and forced both Elise and Alicia closer to the edge of the rooftop. "Stay back! If you take one more step, I'll throw them both off!"

Alexander frowned deeply. Panic and fear swept across his otherwise cold, sharp features.

"Stop! Whatever you want, I'll give it to you. Just don't hurt them," he pleaded.

The kidnapper's eyes gleamed coldly. "Prepare five million dollars," he said. 

Then, he continued, "You can only save one of them. Tell me, who will it be?

Alexander froze. His gaze flickered back and forth between Elise and Alicia. Beside him, Aaron tugged desperately at his pants. "Daddy! Save Alicia! Please save Alicia!"

Alexander looked up at last and finally said, "We'll save Alicia!"

Elise's heart felt like it was being ripped apart as she watched her own son choose another woman over her.

Aaron was the child she had nearly died giving birth to, having suffered massive blood loss during delivery. Alexander was also the man she had loved for six years, yet he discarded her as if she were nothing more than trash.

Fortunately, she had never truly placed her hopes in either of them.

If no one would save her, she would save herself.

While the kidnapper pushed Alicia forward and everyone's attention was on her, Elise made her move. Gritting her teeth, she lowered her head and rammed straight into the kidnapper with all the strength she had left. 

The sudden impact caught him off guard, causing him to stumble back and release his grip. Elise lost her balance as well and tumbled down the stairs.

The security guards arrived just in time to restrain the kidnapper, but Elise paid a heavy price. The stitches on her arm split open, and blood quickly gathered beneath her.

Both of them were rushed back to the hospital. Due to the severity of the kidnapping, the police needed to question them, so they were temporarily placed in the same room.

Elise's mother-in-law, Amanda Lane, and her sister-in-law, Avery Bennett, hurried back from their vacation the moment they heard what had happened. However, the first person they fussed over was Alicia, who hadn't even been injured.

"Alicia, are you alright? We were scared to death when we heard the news," Avery said with a worried look.

"Make sure Alex gets you something nourishing to help you recover," Amanda added. "Your hands are your greatest asset. They weren't hurt, were they?"

Alicia smiled graciously, then turned toward Elise, who looked pale and frail, sitting quietly on the hospital bed.

"I'm fine. Thank you for your concern, Amanda, Avery. Actually, the one who is more seriously injured is Elise."

Amanda and Avery cast Elise a look of disdain.

"What could possibly happen to her?" Amanda said coldly, "She's built like a rock. A few injuries won't hurt her."

Avery gritted her teeth and added, "Someone like her is better off dead. At least then she wouldn't be clinging to my brother with that pathetic look on her face. I never agreed to their marriage in the first place. With a background like hers, she's not fit to be part of the Bennett family."

Ever since she married Alexander, Amanda and Avery had never stopped criticizing her. Having once lived on the streets with no knowledge of her origins, Elise was someone they
