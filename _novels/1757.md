After an eight-year relationship, I was pregnant and getting married.
At the altar, the officiant asked if I would take Leo Miller as my husband. Just as I was about to say yes, a tiny, childlike voice echoed in my mind.
【Mommy, don’t say yes! My daddy isn't Leo Miller!】
【Your sister is the one carrying Leo’s baby!】
The two sentences completely short-circuited my brain.
The entire wedding party was waiting for my answer, but I was frozen. If the baby in my belly wasn't Leo's, then whose was it?
The next moment, the little voice continued.
【Silly Mommy, that cheater has been sleeping with your sister for ages! If you marry him, he's going to lock you in the basement!】
【Quick, call for my real dad's help! He's the richest, most handsome man in the audience!】
I was stunned. My eyes involuntarily darted to a man in the front row—the notoriously aloof and untouchable titan of high society, Julian Astor.
…
Even though it was my wedding, everyone's attention seemed to gravitate toward him. The man’s presence was magnetic, his looks and aura utterly captivating. I glanced at him, and my gaze met his icy stare. I quickly looked away, my heart pounding.
"Sweetie, do you even know who that is?" I thought desperately. "He's the CEO of the Astor Corporation, the biggest conglomerate in the country. He’s never been seen with a woman. How could you possibly be his child?"
"I know Leo isn’t rich, but you can’t just make things up and disown your own father! Honey, you need to face reality."
"It's a little late to be picking a new dad. Try again in your next life."
I tried to soothe the little voice, assuming he was just being a snob about Leo's finances. But I never expected him to shout back.
【Have you forgotten that time you woke up in a hotel room?】
【Your fiancé and your sister tricked you, intending to sell you to a client. But you stumbled into the wrong room…】
【The man lying next to you that morning was Julian Astor!】
My jaw dropped. "He's Julian Astor? I thought it was Leo..."
The memories came rushing back like a tidal wave: a dark room, a back covered in red marks, limbs tangled together.
Leo was still looking at me with a gentle expression, but all I could see was Julian’s sweat-slicked body, hear his strained, controlled breaths. My hands pinned above my head as he took what he wanted. The famously self-disciplined tycoon was an absolute animal behind closed doors.
The officiant, seeing my hesitation, repeated the question. "Ms. Hayes, do you take Mr. Miller to be your lawfully wedded husband?"
Leo squeezed my hand, his face etched with concern. "What's wrong, Chloe? Are you having second thoughts?" He gently stroked my palm. "Don't be scared. Once you're part of my family, I'll give you everything. I'll cherish you."
【Don't believe a word he says! He bought a villa right next to your new house, a place for him, your sister, and their baby!】
The voice jolted me back to reality. "I don't!" I shouted.
A gasp rippled through the crowd. The Millers were a prominent family in the city of Silver Creek. For me to publicly reject Leo was something no one had anticipated. After all, I had chased him relentlessly for years, shamelessly playing the part of the devoted puppy. Everyone said Chloe Hayes was a wild, shameless flirt. Now that I finally had him, I was throwing it all away.
Leo's face turned ugly. He never imagined I would refuse him at the altar. "Chloe, stop playing around. This is our wedding! If you have a problem with me, we can talk about it later…"
【Later will be too late! My real dad is about to fly overseas to chase after his old flame!】
【Mom, time is running out! Ditch this scumbag and get my handsome, rich daddy back!】
"I'm not marrying him!" I said, my voice firm. My own son wouldn't lie to me. If he said Leo was a cheater, then I couldn't marry him.
Just then, my sister, Sarah, walked onto the stage, her hand resting on her swollen belly. She stood beside Leo. "Chloe, what's all this about? Leo agreed to marry you, didn't he?"
As she got closer, I noticed the diamond ring on her finger. It was the exact same style as my wedding ring. But comparing the two, mine looked like cheap plastic.
In that instant, everything clicked into place. The baby in my womb was just a pawn in her and Leo’s scheme. As an adopted daughter, she could never marry into the Miller family. I was just a tool, a means for her to secure that alliance.
My parents stood up, their voices filled with fury. "Chloe! Haven't you embarrassed our family enough? You think you can just call off a wedding like this?"
"You're the one who begged to marry Leo, and now you're backing out at the last minute! Do you think marriage is a game? Why can't you be more sensible, like your sister?"
"You are getting married today, whether you like it or not!"

The wedding had devolved into a farce. Guests whispered among themselves, eagerly awaiting the next chapter of my humiliation.
"That Hayes girl is nothing but trouble. First, she shamelessly chases after the Miller heir, and now that she's got him, she wants to call it off. The whole town is just waiting to see her get thrown out of her own family."
"Her adopted sister is so much better. She's refined, well-mannered, married some rich kid. She knows her place."
"The Hayes family is so unlucky to have a daughter like that."
The whispers reached my ears, and I realized my reputation in Silver Creek had hit rock bottom. But I used to be the well-bred, respected daughter of the Hayes family. It seemed that ever since Sarah had been adopted, my status had plummeted. My parents' and Leo's attitudes toward me had slowly changed.
Leo grabbed my hand, ignoring my protests as he addressed the guests. "Chloe is just a little overwhelmed. Please forgive her. She agrees to marry me, and I am willing to take her as my wife."
Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Sarah clench her fists. I took a deep breath and yanked my hand away from Leo. "I said no, and I mean it! I know about you and my sister! The baby in her belly is yours, isn't it, Leo?"
My words exploded like a bomb in the banquet hall.
【Way to go, Mom! Expose those two-faced liars!】
【Your sister has been spreading rumors about you for years! She's the reason your reputation is in the gutter!】
The little voice in my belly cheered, egging on the chaos.
"What are you talking about?!" Sarah clutched her mouth, feigning innocence. "Chloe, I can handle you bullying me in private, but why would you say something so horrible in front of everyone?"
"How could you use my baby as an excuse to run away from your own wedding?"
Her words seemed to steady Leo. His guilt-ridden expression hardened into one of righteous indignation. "Chloe, that's enough! Even if you don't want to get married, you have no right to slander me and your sister!"
My parents looked at me with utter disappointment and rage. "Are you out of your mind?! Humiliating your sister and your fiancé in public? Why did we ever have a daughter like you?"
"Do you have any idea what a laughingstock you've made of us?"
The guests were practically howling with laughter. "This is better than a movie! The eldest Hayes daughter, accusing her own fiancé and sister of an affair at her wedding! She really is shameless!"
I tore off my veil and threw it to the ground, turning to leave. But several large men blocked the exit. While I was distracted, Leo seized my wrist, intending to drag me through the rest of the ceremony. His voice was a low hiss, his usually gentle face contorted with rage. "Once you're a Miller, you won't have the luxury of being so impulsive!"
The eyes of the crowd were filled with mockery and amusement. No one cared what I wanted.
For the first time, a cold wave of clarity washed over me. I finally understood how dire my situation was. I was nothing but a pawn to my fiancé and my adopted sister. The voice in my belly screamed in panic.
【Once this ceremony is over, your husband is going to find an excuse to lock you in the basement!】
【There are black cars waiting outside! The moment you step out of this hall, they're going to grab you!】
【Mom, ask my real dad for help! Now!】
Julian Astor? I looked to where he had been sitting, but he was already on his feet, heading for the exit with his assistant.
【Oh no, Dad is leaving to catch his flight! He’s going to find his old flame!】
This might be my last chance. In a moment of desperation, I bit down hard on the fleshy part of Leo’s hand. He cried out in pain and loosened his grip. I spun around and bolted, throwing myself in Julian's direction.
Bodyguards moved to intercept me, but I shoved a table over, sending a tower of wine glasses crashing to the floor. The crowd shrieked as I tore through the chaos, the long train of my dress trailing behind me.
I didn't care. I ran straight for Julian.
His assistant was caught off guard. Julian heard the commotion and turned just as I slammed into his chest. "Take me with you," I begged. "Please!"
His face was obscured by the light, but the next thing I knew, I was being shoved to the ground. He brushed off his suit as if I were something filthy, his eyes filled with disgust. "Get lost. Don't you know I don't touch women?"
【He's bluffing! Don't believe him! He’s just putting on an act now. Once he falls for you, he'll turn into a clingy little puppy!】
Julian turned to leave again, but I grabbed the hem of his pants, refusing to let go.
Footsteps pounded behind me. Leo and his bodyguards caught up, restraining me. My parents looked on in terror at the thunderous expression on Julian's face. "We are so sorry, Mr. Astor! Our daughter isn't well. We will come to your home personally to apologize for this offense!"
Leo chimed in, his voice groveling. "Mr. Astor, it's my fault. I should have kept a better eye on her. I'll make sure she's properly disciplined. Please, forgive us!"
Sarah just stared at Julian with a look of pure adoration, the same look every woman in Silver Creek seemed to have for him.
Julian didn't answer. He just looked down at my hand clutching his pant leg. Sarah followed his gaze, then lifted her stiletto and brought it down hard on the back of my hand. "Chloe, how dare you accost Mr. Astor! Let go!"
I cried out in pain. Julian took the opportunity to pull his leg free and strode away without a backward glance.
As his figure was about to disappear, I screamed in desperation, "Julian Astor, the baby I'm carrying is yours!"

Julian froze. A strange, unnerving silence fell over the room. The guests all turned to stare at me, their expressions shifting from mockery to a kind of pitying disbelief, as if I were a complete lunatic.
Sarah, clearly delighted that I was now dragging Julian into this mess, leaned in and whispered, "Trying to climb the social ladder, are we, Chloe? I think you picked the wrong branch."
"Julian Astor is not a man you can just latch onto."
She was right. Everyone knew Julian Astor was a virtual monk, repulsed by contact with women. The string of prayer beads he always carried was proof of his celibacy. The last woman who tried to get close to him with ulterior motives ended up with broken bones and a tombstone for a future.
"Is this woman suicidal? I thought she was just trashy, but it turns out she's insane. No one who crosses Mr. Astor ends up well…"
The crowd held its breath, waiting for Julian to explode.
As expected, he turned, his lips pressed into a thin, hard line, his face a mask of cold fury. His gaze was like that of an executioner as he stared at me, his fingers working the prayer beads. "My child? Heh. You've got some nerve, Ms. Hayes."
"No one in this city has ever been bold enough to show up pregnant and claim the child is mine. I've heard about your reputation. Have you really sunk so low as to claim another man as your baby's father at your own wedding?"
The clicking of the beads echoed in the silent hall, a sound that struck fear into everyone's hearts. It was the sound of Julian's impending wrath.
Leo immediately pushed my head to the floor, forcing me to bow as he pleaded with Julian. "I'm so sorry, Mr. Astor! She's really not in her right mind! Please, just forgive her this once!"
"Apologize to Mr. Astor! Now!"
Seeing that Leo didn't seem to care at all that I had just announced the child wasn't his, I knew he was well aware of the truth. He just wanted to control me, to have a convenient cover for his affair with Sarah.
【Don't be scared, Mom! If you can prove the baby is Dad's, he won't abandon you!】
【Once you have the Astor family backing you, all these people who bullied you will get what's coming to them!】
Proof? I let out a bitter laugh. What proof did I have? I didn't even know the man.
My parents rushed forward and slapped me twice, hard. "Apologize to Mr. Astor! Are you trying to get our entire family killed?" my mother shrieked.
Julian looked down at me from his lofty height. I was a pathetic mess, like a worm in the dirt. The memory of that passionate night felt like a distant, unreal dream. But then, I remembered something. I looked up at him, my voice surprisingly calm. "Mr. Astor, I saw the rose-colored birthmark."
His expression didn't change, but his eyes widened in surprise. The birthmark was on his lower abdomen, a very private place. No one who wasn't intimate with him could possibly know about it.
The other guests just looked at each other, confused. But Sarah, ever the opportunist, chimed in. "Chloe, everyone has birthmarks. You can't use something so trivial as proof of a relationship with Mr. Astor. Countless women have tried similar tricks over the years."
"If you really want to prove the baby is his, why not get a paternity test?"
Sarah was smug. She didn't believe for a second that there was anything between me and Julian. After all, how could a nobody from a minor family like the Hayeses ever get involved with the most powerful man in Silver Creek? Leo had pulled every string he had, spent a fortune, just to get Julian to even show up at the wedding.
The crowd immediately agreed. "Yeah, a paternity test! That will shut her up!"
"Who does she think she is, trying to claim a connection to Mr. Astor? And at her own wedding! What a shameless tramp!"
"She wants to make a scene? Let's give her a paternity test and expose her for the liar she is! Run her out of town!"
Julian's expression was unreadable, but after a moment, he nodded, giving me a chance. "Fine. A paternity test. At least you'll know why you're being destroyed."
【You're amazing, Mom! I can't wait to see Dad eat his words! Hahaha!】
【Don't worry, I'll teach you how to handle him. Once he falls in love with you, you'll have a loyal little puppy on your hands!】
The wedding fiasco quickly became the talk of the town. Julian’s grandfather, the patriarch of the Astor family, heard the news and rushed to the scene. When he saw the private doctor drawing my blood, a look of pure joy spread across his face. "This is wonderful! I might get to hold my grandchild before I die."
Julian sneered. "Let's hope she's still in one piece when the results come back and expose her."
I closed my eyes, letting them draw my blood. My parents stood by, trembling with fear, terrified I would bring ruin upon the family. Leo's face was a thundercloud. His fiancée was getting a paternity test for another man's child at their own wedding. Even if that other man was Julian Astor, it was the ultimate humiliation.
【Good thing Mom didn't marry this Miller guy. He was planning how to torture you after the wedding!】
【Oww, needles hurt! But I'll endure it for Mommy's happiness!】
I was bruised and battered, and the blood draw left me weak and dizzy. I leaned on the little voice's encouragement as I waited for the results. The guests stared at me with hungry, predatory eyes, all of them eagerly anticipating my downfall. No one believed that the celibate Julian Astor could have a child. I was starting to realize that if the baby wasn't his, my life was over.
Finally, there were hurried footsteps outside. Julian's assistant rushed in, clutching a report, and whispered something in Julian's ear.
Julian's cold, indifferent expression was replaced by one of utter shock. His grandfather, growing impatient, tapped his cane on the floor. "Stop whispering! Is it my great-grandchild or not? Just say it!"
Sarah giggled, covering her mouth. "Is there even a question? Of course it's not a Astor. It's all just my sister's lies…"
The assistant wiped the sweat from his brow and announced, "The probability of paternity between Ms. Hayes' child and Mr. Astor is 99.99%!"
