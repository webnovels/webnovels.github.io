Finn booked the flight for a month later.

On the day I went to the lawyer to draft the divorce papers, I passed by Jasper's MMA Club. Thinking about the effort I put into it, I decided to take a look and say goodbye to the members.

Unexpectedly, I saw two figures entangled in the stairwell and heard Jasper and Phoebe's voices.

"Jasper, be gentle~ Don't bite there~"

"Phoebe, you're so soft and smooth..."

"Hmph, did you say the same to Adeline? I heard she even took a stab for you. Such deep love..."

I stood there, feeling as if I had fallen into an ice pit. That's when Phoebe noticed me, quickly pushed Jasper away, and came over while adjusting her clothes.

"Adeline, don't mind us. I just needed Jasper to help me with my bra clasp~" She said, but secretly pinched the bruises on my hand.

In pain, I reflexively tried to pull my hand back, causing Phoebe to fall down the stairs.

Jasper pushed me aside and rushed to carry Phoebe to the hospital.

I sat frozen in the club's office, and hours later, Jasper finally returned.

"Phoebe lost the baby. I saw you push her down the stairs."

"Adeline, when did you become so vicious?"

"Even if Phoebe did something wrong, couldn't you forgive her for the child's sake?"

I looked at his face, full of undisguised contempt, and let out a cold laugh.

"Are you referring to her mistake of seducing a married man?"

Jasper's face darkened. "I fell in love with Phoebe first! Blame me if you want!"

"To compensate Phoebe, I've decided to transfer your shares in the club to her for free."

I looked at his still handsome and resolute face in shock, feeling like he was a stranger. Years ago, he used my payment of his medical bills as an excuse to repay me by picking me up from work every day.

Spending time together every day, I eventually fell for this resilient boy when he blocked a punch from a hospital troublemaker for me.

Upon learning about his tragic past, I worked part-time delivering food while interning at the hospital, using the money I earned to support his MMA dreams.

Once, an opponent dissatisfied with losing a fight stopped us in an alley after a match. In the confrontation, I saw a flash of a knife aimed at Jasper. My body reacted faster than my mind, and I shielded him. When I came to, the knife was already in my chest.

Jasper was terrified, trembling as he held me, begging the attackers to help get me to a hospital.

The knife missed my heart's aorta by just a centimeter, and I nearly met the Grim Reaper.

When I woke up, the first thing I saw was Jasper, red-eyed and haggard, by my bedside. He held my hand tightly, promising,

"Adeline, I, Jasper, will never let you down in this lifetime!"

During my recovery, staring dazedly at the scar on my chest in the mirror, Jasper hugged me from behind.

"Adeline, no matter how you change, you're always the most beautiful to me. And this scar, it's a testament to our love."

Remembering this, I looked at Jasper with tear-filled eyes, then unbuttoned my shirt to reveal the scar on my chest. My tears fell, landing on the ugly scar.

"Jasper... have you forgotten your own words..."

He shuddered, unable to meet my eyes or look at my scar, fleeing the office.
