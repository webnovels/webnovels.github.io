I was at the engagement party with my childhood sweetheart, Jasper, when my foster sister burst into the hall, crying that she'd miscarry without him.

She claimed Jasper got drunk, entered the wrong room, and mistook her for me, taking her again and again.

Jasper was flustered, and the gentle hand that was on Phoebe's shoulder fell away:

"Adeline, let me explain!"

I looked at the champagne roses filling the hall, removed my ring, and clapped:

"The trash can is out the door on the left."

The whole room erupted, and Phoebe bit her lip as tears streamed down her face.

The bodyguards quickly came forward to escort her out.

They didn't know that after they had plotted to kill my parents, seized the property, and poisoned me, I was reborn.

Reborn to the engagement party where none of it had happened yet.

"Sister!" Phoebe screamed and struggled.

"I didn't mean to... Jasper was drunk and mistook me for you."

...

She spoke, deliberately revealing the ambiguous red marks on her neck.

I felt a wave of nausea and my fingertips dug into my palms.

A few hours earlier, I'd woken up in the lounge, with my whole being in a daze.

The last moments before my death kept replaying in my mind.

I was forced to drink poison, my insides felt like they were pierced by a thousand steel needles.

I fell to the ground, seeing Phoebe holding Jasper's arm, looking down on me with a smile.

"Sister, rest in peace."

Phoebe caressed her slightly swollen belly.

"Jasper and I will take good care of the Anderson family."

My vision blurred and finally fixed on the news of my parents' tragic deaths—

"Anderson Corporation's chairman and wife die in a car crash, only daughter Adeline suffers a mental breakdown..."

All these past events made my head spin.

The two people I trusted most, my childhood sweetheart and my sister, both betrayed me.

"Adeline? Adeline!"

A familiar voice snapped me back to reality, and behind me was my worried mother.

"Why are you daydreaming before your engagement?"

My mother adjusted my diamond necklace, "The Harris Family is all here."

I looked at everything familiar in the hall, things I had personally arranged for Jasper.

In hindsight, it was truly ironic.

The banquet hall was resplendent, and Jasper, in a white suit, was gracefully accepting blessings.

A hint of amazement flashed in his eyes.

"Adeline, you look beautiful today."

I looked at the face I used to be infatuated with, feeling a surge in my stomach: "Mr. Harris."

I subtly avoided his outstretched hand, "The emcee is calling us."

Jasper's expression froze for a moment, then he raised a smile:

"Adeline, there's no need to be distant. After today, we'll be the closest of people."

I secretly smiled.

3, 2, 1...

I silently counted down, anticipating the upcoming drama.

Sure enough, halfway through the engagement ceremony, the doors to the banquet hall were suddenly flung open.

My sister stumbled in, her dress neckline torn half open, and rushed straight to Jasper.

"Jasper, how could you do this to me..."

Jasper's face changed drastically, but instinctively he caught Phoebe, "Phoebe, what are you..."

"I can't go on!"

Phoebe screamed hysterically, "Sister, Jasper got drunk last night and, and..."

She deliberately let her strap slide down, revealing more marks.

The guests' eyes darted between the three of us, and murmurs filled the room.

Mrs. Anderson was the first to lose composure, striding over to Phoebe, her gaze sharp.

"Didn't you say you twisted your ankle and couldn't attend?"

Phoebe sobbed, while Jasper comfortingly wiped her tears away.

What a pair of lovers!

What a display of uncontrollable emotions!

It's just a pity; one is my fiancé, and the other is my dear sister.

I stood still and suddenly laughed.
