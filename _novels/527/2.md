Seeing Sophia so adamant, Chief Zhang didn't argue further.

I knew Michael's death had always been Sophia's deepest wound.

Because Michael had been the love of her life.

Michael knew he didn't love her, so he rejected her advances. That's how I got the chance to pursue her.

But after Michael died, everything changed.

Sophia cursed me as a murderer, the one who killed Michael. She demanded I give my life in exchange for his!

She slapped me over and over, until my mouth was bleeding and teeth were falling out, but it still wasn't enough to satisfy her rage.

"Tell me! Why wasn't it you who died instead of Michael?!"

Sophia gripped my throat tightly, like a vicious monster.

"You won't speak? If you don't, I'll kill you myself!"

Yes, I wondered the same thing.

Why was it Michael who died, and not me?

If it had been me, I wouldn't have had to endure all this suffering!

Chief Zhang sighed heavily. "Sophia, don't be like this. Michael is gone, Jack needs to stay safe and well."

Sophia clenched her fists, saying coldly, "If he were gone too, that would be justice served!"

Chief Zhang shook his head and turned to leave.

The woman I once loved more than anything now wished for my death.

To say it didn't hurt would be a lie.

Just then, Sophia's assistant walked in.

He was holding a scrap of paper, stained with blood and mud.

On it, barely legible, were the words: "Peach Blossom Gardens Purchase Contract"

So I had been clutching that contract tightly when I died.

I remembered - it was for the house I had bought to please her.

A 3000 square foot beachfront condo.

$300,000 down payment, $8000 monthly mortgage payments for 30 years.

I had used up all my savings, just to see her smile.

But she had only nodded and said dismissively, "This is what you owe me!"

Sophia merely glanced at it and said flatly, "Mm, put it in an evidence bag."

Didn't she recognize that Peach Blossom Gardens was the home I had bought for her?

When we first got married, I was broke.

Sophia's biggest dream was to live in a beachfront home of our own.

So I worked day and night at the company, putting in overtime, all to make her dream come true.

"Thank you, honey. We'll have our own home someday!" she would say tenderly whenever I worked late.

But after Michael died, everything changed.

The woman who once loved me became the one who hated me most.

I watched helplessly as that contract was sealed away in an evidence bag, my heart aching.

Oh Sophia, you missed your best chance to recognize me.

After finishing up in the lab, she leaned back in her chair to rest.

She frowned as she checked her phone, finding no messages from me. It irritated her.

After all, before this, I would send her dozens of caring messages every day.

Even though her only response was usually a curt "Mm."

She gripped her phone, scrolling up through our chat history.

Finally stopping at my last desperate plea for help.

"Sophia, save me!"

Sophia's face twisted in disgust as she spat on the ground.

"Jack is such a liar! First he gets his brother killed, and now he dares to send this kind of message to trick me!"

She scowled as she blocked and deleted my contact.

But Sophia, don't you know that once you delete me, you can never add me back?
