But she just silently took out a scalpel from her bag.

"Do you think you have any right to negotiate? Don't make me get nasty."

Before I could react, she kicked the back of my knees hard.

"Thud!"

I collapsed to the ground.

Instantly, rocks and thorns dug into my knees.

It was an excruciating, searing pain.

My stomach churned violently, the agony almost unbearable.

I tried to slowly stand up, fighting through the pain.

Sophia coldly pressed the scalpel against the crook of my arm.

"You know the consequences of trying to bargain, don't you?"

An icy chill ran deep into my bones.

Without blinking, Sophia slashed my arm over and over.

New wounds overlapped old scars, a horrifying sight.

Gritting her teeth, she drove the scalpel deep into my flesh.

"Click...click..."

I could even feel the blade scraping against bone.

"Ahh!"

I bit down hard, trying to stifle my cries.

One cut.

Two cuts.

Carving into living flesh and bone - it was nothing short of torture.

Finally, I passed out in the cemetery.

But Sophia just left. She didn't look back.

Blood loss and hypothermia caused me to go into shock on the ground.

As I lost consciousness, all I saw was her retreating back.

And her cold warning:

"Since you want to play dead for sympathy, just stay here then! Better if you actually die!"

Resolute and merciless.

It reminded me of when we first got together.

Sophia had been gentle and sweet, often cuddling up to me.

Back then, I thought I must be the luckiest man in the world.

But I was wrong.

The woman I had cherished now wanted me dead!

I wanted her love too. I wanted the sweet, normal marriage other couples had.

But I didn't deserve it.

I was just the sinner who got his brother killed. I would never deserve love in this lifetime.

Just when I thought I was going to die, the old cemetery caretaker found me.

Seeing my condition, his eyes filled with sympathy.

"Oh dear, what happened to you, young man?"

"Does it hurt?"

At the hospital, he grasped my hand.

"Son, should I call the police for you?"

I shook my head.

"Thank you for your kindness, sir. But this is my own sin to bear."

In the end, I dragged my battered body out of the hospital.

Because I knew I still had to work overtime, still had to buy Sophia her dream beachfront home.

As soon as I walked in the door at home, Sophia kicked me hard.

Blood rushed to her head as she waved a phone in my face.

"You bastard, are you trying to humiliate me?!"

She clenched her jaw, looking ready to eat me alive.

"Now you've even gone to the police? I'm telling you, it's useless no matter how many reports you file. Everyone at the station is on my side."

"As long as I don't kill you myself, no one can touch me!"

Another kick landed, making me feel like my internal organs had been scrambled.

I curled up on the floor, unable to move.

Sophia, I don't want to humiliate you. I just want you to love me...

One kick wasn't enough to satisfy her rage.

So she started aiming for my head instead.

"You killed Michael, and now you're trying to ruin me too?"

"I'll kill you! I'll kill you!"

That's how the dent in my skull was formed.

Even as she kicked me until my head was cracked and bleeding, I never blamed her one bit.

Sometimes I would even fantasize that once she got her anger out, things would get better.

But I died.

I died the day I signed that home purchase contract.

The happy little family that was supposed to be ours would never exist now.

"Mom, Dad, today is the anniversary of your passing."

Hearing Sophia's voice snapped me back to the present.

She had already walked around to the other side of the cemetery, standing before two gravestones.

Only then did I remember - today was also my parents' death anniversary.

She laid down the paper money and chrysanthemums.

"A few years ago, Jack killed Michael - his own brother!"

"He's a monster! He destroyed our whole family!"

She clenched her fists, face contorted with anger.

But now I'm dead too. Shouldn't that count as a life for a life?

"Long time no see, sister-in-law."

Michael's familiar voice came from behind.

Sophia turned around in disbelief.

"Is that...is that really you, Michael?"

Michael nodded.

Next to him stood a young woman with a delicate face.

The paper money scattered from Sophia's hands as she stepped forward, wanting to confirm it was really him.

"It really is Michael! You're back!"

Michael uncomfortably took a step back.

"Yes, I'm back."

"I came to pay respects to Mom and Dad on their death anniversary."

By now Sophia had lost all composure, moving to embrace him.

Large tears rolled down her face as she broke down sobbing.

"You're back...I thought you were dead...oh god..."

The young woman finally stepped forward to intervene.

"It's been a while, sister-in-law! I'm Michael's wife, Rose."

Hearing this, Sophia froze in place.

"You're...Michael's wife?"

She couldn't understand why Michael had returned with a wife.

The atmosphere instantly became tense.

Michael finally sensed the awkwardness and changed the subject: "Where's Jack? Why isn't he here for Mom and Dad's death anniversary?"

At the mention of me, Sophia's expression changed back to one of utter disgust.

"Him? Who knows where he's off fooling around now!"

Michael nodded, not asking any further.

But I'm not off fooling around - I'm right here beside you!

Sophia shifted the topic back to Michael.

"But weren't you in a car accident years ago?"

Michael sheepishly scratched his head.

"That was actually just a ruse for me to disappear."

"Back then, I owed money to some loan sharks and was being hunted down by enemies. I had no choice but to fake my death."

Hearing this, I felt my blood run cold.

A sense of helpless anguish welled up in my chest.

All those years of kneeling and repenting in the dirt.

The searing pain of the scalpel cutting to the bone.

The endless self-loathing and guilt.

All of it had been for nothing. A cruel joke.

Sophia was stunned.

Perhaps she was realizing she had wronged me all this time?

But it was far too late now. I was already dead!

In an instant, her demeanor changed to one of warmth and care.

"I'm just glad you're back safe. It's wonderful to have the family reunited."

This gentle, caring side of her was something I hadn't experienced in years.

Michael nodded.

Suddenly, as if remembering something, Sophia grabbed Michael's hand excitedly.

"You must be missing home-cooked food after being gone so long. Let me make you both a welcome home dinner!"

"Sounds great!"

Home-cooked food?

I had long forgotten what home tasted like.

The three of them returned home together.

Not one of them remembered my existence. It was as if I had never existed at all.

Soon the table was laden with dishes.

It was all seafood.

All Michael's favorite foods.

Sophia had remembered his tastes perfectly.

But she had forgotten that I was deathly allergic to seafood.

Three place settings were laid out.

"Hey, where's Jack? Why isn't he back yet?" Michael asked her.

Only then did Sophia finally remember me.

She took out her phone, intending to call me.

But she had long since deleted all my contact information.

"Michael, why don't you try calling? I just got a new phone and haven't saved his number yet."

Michael's expression was hesitant, but he complied.

He called several times, but there was no answer.

"That's strange..." Michael frowned.

Rose suddenly spoke up: "You don't think something might have happened to your brother, do you?"

Hearing this, Sophia exploded like an angry shrew: "That kind of man? It's normal for him to disappear for days at a time!"

That kind of man?

What kind of man am I?

The kind who worked tirelessly to support our family?

Or the kind who silently endured her abuse?

Now that Michael was safely back, she still refused to let me go!

Looking at this woman before me, I felt like I no longer knew her at all.

Michael's brows furrowed as he suddenly demanded: "Are you saying Jack has been missing for 3-4 days already?!"

Sophia was startled by his outburst. "Y-yes...what's wrong?"

Michael glared at her fiercely before grabbing his keys and rushing out the door.

But his retreating figure looked panicked.

A few hours later, Michael returned empty-handed.

In just those few hours, he seemed to have aged years.

"Jack...Jack is missing!"

"How can that be?!"

Rose jumped up from the couch.

She steadied Michael, saying seriously: "We need to file a police report! We have to find Jack!"

But Sophia just got up to pour Michael a glass of water.

"Oh, it's fine!"

"Jack hates coming home. He's either at the office or probably at that Emily girl's place."

She spoke of Emily with utter contempt.

Michael and Rose insisted on calling the police, leaving Sophia ignored on the sidelines.

Only then did I realize that blood ties run deeper than romantic love.

"Jack is just playing games. Why waste police resources?" Sophia said awkwardly.

Even though Michael had returned safe and sound, Sophia still hated me.

I didn't understand why anymore.

Was it just habit?

Or had she never truly loved me at all?

Just as Michael was hanging up from calling the police, Sophia's phone rang.

"Ms. Liang, we've found the victim's left hand."

"The hand hasn't fully decomposed yet. We've been able to mostly confirm the victim's identity based on the remains..."

It was her young assistant calling.

Sophia absently fiddled with her hand as she replied, "Mm, go on."

"Ms. Liang, you should prepare yourself."

The call was on speakerphone, so Michael and Rose looked over.

Sophia also seemed to sense the gravity of the situation.

She raised her head, her expression somber.

"It's alright, just tell me."
