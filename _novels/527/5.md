The person on the other end gathered their courage.

"The victim's true identity...is your husband, Jack."

In an instant, Sophia looked like she had been struck by lightning.

"Wait...how is that possible?"

Michael collapsed to his knees, covering his face as he broke down: "Jack...is dead?"

Sophia, as if refusing to believe it, continued questioning.

"How can that be? Are you joking? How could it possibly be Jack?"

The voice on the phone sighed. "There's no mistake."

"He had May 10th tattooed on his left hand. Everyone knows that's your birthday."

Hearing this, the phone slipped from Sophia's hand and clattered to the floor.

That tattoo - I had gotten it on her 24th birthday.

It covered my entire hand, quite eye-catching.

Sophia had been teased about it plenty of times.

"I don't believe it! Couldn't this be some kind of mistake?"

She still refused to accept it.

But what good would disbelief do now? I was already dead!

The person on the phone quietly offered condolences before hurriedly hanging up.

Sophia suddenly stood up, intending to rush out.

She had barely taken a few steps before stumbling and falling.

"How could it be Jack? There must be some mistake!"

She muttered to herself.

Soon, they all arrived at the police station.

And there were my remains, laid out on the examination table.

My entire body had been reduced to bleached bones, with only the left hand retaining some flesh.

The faded tattoo was barely discernible.

Michael collapsed by the table, wailing: "This...this really is Jack!"

I watched as Sophia shook her head in disbelief, stumbling backwards.

"No...this can't be!"
