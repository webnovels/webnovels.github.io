To repay Aunt Clara for her kindness in raising me, I stepped in for my cousin. I married Mira Sterling, the eldest daughter of the prominent Sterling family, who suffered from autism.

For seven years, she was nothing but cold to me.

I swallowed my pride, even tried to climb into her bed. But all I got in return was endless ridicule and scorn.

Later, I successfully organized a painting exhibition for her. Yet, in front of me, she took another man’s hand.

I knew then. My mission was complete. It was time to leave.
