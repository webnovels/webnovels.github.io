"Eliana, you have worked so hard to become the first national news anchor at Horizon Network. This is the highest achievement, a historic milestone in the field of broadcasting. Are you really going to say no to it all?"

Eliana Winters looked up and met the director, Jonathan Pierce's, serious gaze. It was then that she realized she had been transported back to the moment she made the biggest decision of her life.

Her job offer was still lying open on the desk, with the Horizon Network seal looking fresh and vivid.

Eliana snatched it up and said quickly, "No, I'll do it. I'm in."

Jonathan finally relaxed, a smile breaking through his stern face. "That's great! The first National News goes live in two weeks. You're the face of it. You'll need to head to Northpoint for onboarding soon."

He gently patted her shoulder. "Take some time to get ready. Tell your family. This is something to celebrate, and I'm sure Commander Ford will be proud."

Eliana gave him a faint smile and walked out of the office.

As she headed home, memories started pouring back.

In her last life, her family couldn't feed her during the famine. They left her by the side of the road, and it was the Fords who took her in.

The Ford family was a big deal in the military community. Their only son, Gabriel Ford, was five years older than her and away at the military academy.

At first, the Fords just meant to help. But Gabriel's mother, Margaret Lambert, soon grew fond of Eliana.

"She's hardworking and dependable. She'd make a perfect wife for Gabriel."

Eliana was 16 years old when Gabriel came home on break and found out his parents had picked out his bride for him.

He had slammed his cup down and snapped, "Seriously? What year is this? Are we really still doing arranged marriages? That's insane!"

But his father, Kyler Ford, thumped his cane and said, "You think this is up for discussion? We've chosen Eliana. If you won't marry her, then you're not my son!"

Gabriel caved in the end.

The wedding was simple. Gabriel didn't even look at Eliana. He skipped the toasts and slept in the study that night.

Eliana spent her wedding night alone, staring at the candle as it burned down, tears soaking her wedding dress.

From then on, her life was cold and lonely.

Gabriel was hardly ever home. He might come back once or twice a month. Even then, he stayed locked in his study.

Aside from the two times he came to her just for the sake of having children, he barely touched her at all.

Then, Gabriel got transferred to an island base and brought along his childhood friend, Linda Shaw.

"Take care of my parents and the kids," Gabriel had said before he left, not even looking at Eliana. "If you need anything, put in a request."

So, Eliana took care of the whole family by herself.

She got up before sunrise to cook for her in-laws, took the kids to school, then headed to her shift at the textile factory. When she got home, she helped the kids with their homework and looked after her in-laws.

She followed the same routine every single day for 30 years.

When Gabriel finally got transferred back to Southview, Eliana took the day off, put on her nicest dress, and went to the station to meet him.

She watched Gabriel step off the train with Linda. The kids ran straight to Linda, greeting her warmly.

That night, Gabriel came to her room for the first time in years.

"Let's get divorced." He stood by the door, not even bothering to sit down. "There's nothing between us. We have nothing in common. Linda's waited long enough. She deserves her place."

The kids chimed in, "Mom, times have changed. This arranged marriage never should've happened in the first place."

"Yeah! You don't even know how to speak Virellan. Linda's a doctor, and she plays the piano. You don't even know how to use the TV. What do you have that even comes close to Linda?"

Eliana stared at her own tired reflection in the window.

What did she have that even came close to Linda?

She barely had an education. How could she measure up to Gabriel, a regimental commander in the military?

No one knew she'd finished high school on her own, studying alongside her kids. She'd actually been picked as the first national news anchor. She should have been reading the news at Northpoint.

But she'd given up her dream for Gabriel's parents and their kids.

Eliana refused to agree to the divorce, and Gabriel didn't push it. He just moved out with Linda and the children, leaving her behind in the Ford residence.

So, she spent years alone, right up to the night the house burned down.

Right before she died, she saw Gabriel on TV, wearing his medal and holding Linda's hand. "If I've achieved anything, it's because Linda's been by my side all these years."

A reporter asked, "Word is you've got a wife at home. Do you have anything to say to her?"

Gabriel frowned at the camera. "She's just a housewife. Not worth mentioning."

As the flames closed in, Eliana thought, "If I ever get a second chance at life, I'll show you exactly what a housewife can do after walking away from you and the kids."

The memory faded. 

Eliana stood at her front door, took a deep breath, and pushed it open.

But then, a bucket of cold water poured over her head.

Her daughter, Hannah Ford, laughed from the stairs. "Got you again!"

Her son, Jamie Ford, crossed his arms and scowled. "Serves you right for coming home so late! We've got a guest here. Now, get in the kitchen and start cooking!"

Eliana wiped the water from her face and noticed Linda sitting on the couch.

Linda stood up and said gently, "Hannah, Jamie, you can't treat your mom like that."

"We don't want her to be our mom!" Hannah shouted, clinging to Linda. "Linda, can't you be our mom?"

"Yeah! She knows nothing! She doesn't even know Virellan. You're a doctor, and you play piano. You're so much better than her!" Jamie said.

Eliana suddenly laughed. Hannah and Jamie were stunned to see it.

She bent down to pick up the bucket, water still dripping from her hair. "If you want her to be your mom so bad…" she said calmly before continuing, "Then she can have you."

"What are you talking about?" a cold voice suddenly came from behind her.

Eliana turned around and saw Gabriel standing in the doorway. He was dressed in full uniform, his expression cold and stern.

His gaze landed on her soaked clothes, and his brow furrowed. "What happened?"

Hannah ran over. "Dad! Mom's being mean to us!"

Jamie added, "She said she doesn't want us anymore!"

Gabriel's eyes turned cold.

However, Eliana didn't flinch. She looked straight at Gabriel, finding the whole thing ridiculous.

In her past life, that very look had terrified Eliana into silence. She'd rushed off to cook, apologized, and tried to please everyone.

But this time, she wouldn't do that anymore.
