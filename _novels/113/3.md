In our most carefree year, Zachary once said he wanted to become the most beautiful legend in an uninhabited desert.

We decided on our final resting place at the most inappropriate age.

But now...

At the front door, the whole mansion glowed with colorful lights. I knew they were trying different themes again.

I sat numbly on the steps, almost dozing off.

A jacket that didn't smell like Zachary was draped over me.

"Why are you sitting here? Is Zachary misbehaving again?"

When I looked up, I realized the distinguished man before me was Zachary's uncle, Ian.

I smiled bitterly and said:

"Uncle Ian, can you help expedite my visa application?"

The man just gave a low "Mm" in response.

Early the next morning, Lily stood by my bed with her hands on her hips.

She dumped a bucket of cold water on my face, her expression twisted and hideous.

"Enjoy eavesdropping last night? Zach and I tried several new positions. He praised me for doing well and gave me this 'Eternal Love' jade bracelet. Last night we even used it to..."

I suddenly looked up at her wrist. Tears fell uncontrollably.

My brother had saved money for years, refusing treatment to buy that bracelet as my wedding gift.

The thought of how they desecrated it made my mind explode.

"Give it to me..."

Lily narrowed her eyes and smirked, leaning close to my ear, "Want to bet?"

The next second, she grabbed my hand and shoved her into the toilet, screaming dramatically.

"Help! I won't dare again!"

Zachary rushed in and held me underwater in the bathtub until I nearly suffocated. Then he carefully took Lily into his arms, treasuring her.

I watched as he gently kissed Lily, who was covered in dirty water. My pupils dilated.

"Zach, this bracelet must be from someone important to Claire. If it could lead to death, I don't want it anymore."

Lily burst into tears, sobbing uncontrollably.

Zachary said nothing, just glared at me viciously. He carried Lily and rushed to the hospital.

I swallowed the nausea rising in my stomach, my eyes stinging.

Soon after, Zachary's bodyguards took me to the hospital by force.

They poured medicine into my mouth over and over, then pumped my stomach again and again.

It was repeated over a dozen times until I collapsed in agony. Tears streamed uncontrollably as I vomited until I passed out.

Next door, Zachary was telling stories to entertain Lily as she got an IV drip, making her giggle constantly.

To coax her into getting her stomach pumped, he had all the world's jewels brought to the hospital.

I closed my eyes. He had once spent a year nursing my stomach back to health.

Now it was completely ruined.

Zachary came over with cold eyes. Seeing my reddened eyes, he clenched his fists tightly.

"Claire Johnson, don't think I won't touch you. It's just a stupid bracelet. I can buy you thousands to replace it."

I coughed up blood, letting the tears fall.

"Zachary, would you only be happy if I died?"

Hearing this, Zachary's body froze for a moment.

Then he looked at my abdomen and sneered:

"Could you bear it? The child you schemed so hard to keep, could you bear to part with it?"

I looked at the man before me who was impervious to reason. I no longer wanted to explain.

Ignoring his furious rage, I pulled out the gastric lavage tube and left.

Outside the hospital, Lily invited me into the car with a beaming smile.

Zachary held Lily's hand tightly, not sparing me a glance.

The car reeked of tangerine peels. He didn't give me a chance to get out.

I opened the window. Zachary said coldly:

"Close it. Lily's pregnant and afraid of the wind."

My fingertips trembled. He knew how severe my allergies were.

I stared at my phone expressionlessly.

Zachary's face darkened. Lily giggled coyly:

"Don't blame me, sister. I wasn't feeling well so I asked Zach to set this up."

I replied to messages, occasionally rubbing my arm covered in red spots.

As soon as we got out of the car, I clutched my stomach and retched violently until I was utterly exhausted.
