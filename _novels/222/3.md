The conversation between my mother-in-law and my husband ended on a bad note.

I lay in bed, memories of my past life flooding my mind.

In my past life, after I went into labor, my mother-in-law insisted on a C-section.

She claimed it was to save my husband from the hassle of taking care of two babies at different times.

The newborns looked similar.

My mother-in-law switched the babies while we slept at night.

Due to her age, her child was not healthy and often sick.

Whenever the child was ill, she was more anxious than I was.

At the time, I was glad she cherished her granddaughter.

In contrast, she neglected her own child after giving birth.

The child often cried from hunger, but she refused to breastfeed.

She insisted on formula, often leaving the child hungry or overfed.

Sometimes, I couldn't stand it and helped feed the child.

As the child grew, my mother-in-law either hit or scolded her.

The child always looked timid.

In contrast, my daughter was spoiled by her.

She became bratty and demanding.

Whenever my husband and I tried to discipline her, my mother-in-law intervened.

She even scolded us for being too harsh.

The two children grew up as opposites.

One was a little princess, the other a little servant.

Thinking of the child's last moments, I was heartbroken.

A tiny person, lying quietly on the bed, almost skin and bones.

At four years old, my mother-in-law's child was diagnosed with uremia.

My husband and I actively sought treatment.

My mother-in-law was indifferent and blamed us for wasting money.

Finally, a kidney transplant was necessary.

My husband, feeling sorry for his sister's plight, went for matching.

He was a match.

Upon learning this, my mother-in-law threw a fit and blocked the donation.

In the end, seeing no other choice, she disappeared with the child.

When my husband and I found them back in our hometown, the child was already lifeless on the bed.

My husband and mother-in-law had a huge fight over this.

After the child's passing, I came home early one day.

I overheard my mother-in-law on the phone.

That's when I discovered the truth.

I broke down on the spot.

I lunged at her, hitting her with all my might.

Then I ran out to report it to the police.

Hearing my intention to call the police, she chased after me.

The elevator was taking too long, so I wanted to use the stairs.

Unexpectedly, she pushed me hard from behind.

And with that, my life ended.

Lying on the ground, close to death, I seemed to see something familiar flash by.

And my daughter stood beside her.

Later, under her influence, my daughter claimed I accidentally fell.

My husband was devastated but didn't suspect our four-year-old.

The faint sounds outside my room interrupted my thoughts.

I knew my mother-in-law must have sneaked out again, just like in the past life.

If she insists on having this child, I'll let her.

After all, I have a big surprise waiting for her.

When my husband realized she was gone, he was frantic and wanted to search.

He called all our friends and family but found no leads.

He even went back to our hometown but she wasn't there.

He wanted to report it to the police.

I stopped him.

"Honey, she's deliberately avoiding you. You won't find her."

He was anxious.

"She's so old and pregnant. What if something happens?"

I thought, what could happen? She's probably with her old lover.

"She's hiding because she's afraid you'll make her abort. Don't worry, she'll return when she's further along."

"If you report it and everyone finds out, how will she face them?"

He nodded weakly.

Soon, I reached late pregnancy.

One day, I came home and found my mother-in-law had returned.

My husband angrily confronted her.

She suddenly knelt before me.

Startled, I quickly stepped aside.

He rushed to help her up.

Tears welled up in her eyes as she looked at both of us.

I said, "She was probably hiding because she feared you'd pressure her to end the pregnancy. Don't worry, she'll likely return when she's further along."

“If you call the police and everyone finds out, how will mother-in-law maintain her reputation?”

My husband nodded, looking helpless.

Soon, I was in the later stages of my pregnancy.

One day, I came home to find my mother-in-law had returned.

My husband angrily confronted her.

Suddenly, she knelt down in front of me.

Startled, I quickly stepped aside.

My husband rushed to help her up.

With tears in her eyes, she looked at both of us.

"I'm begging you, please. Otherwise, I don't know what else I can do but end my life."

My husband glared at her, breathing heavily.

"Where were you when I told you to deal with it? You wouldn't listen."

"Now you come to us? Figure it out yourself."

"I'm not handling this."

Hearing this, she began to cry softly.

"Declan, I know I was wrong. If your father finds out, what will happen to us? This family will fall apart."

"Please, just help me this once."

My husband turned his head away, silent.

She then turned to me.

"Phoebe, if you don't help me, I really can't go on."

"If people find out, what will I do?"

My husband said, "Now you're worried about disgrace? Why didn't you think of that before?"

She became upset, "Fine, I'm ashamed. I'll just go and end it. If you won't help me, I can't live anyway."

With that, she rushed towards the balcony.

My husband wanted to stop her, but I held him back.

She reached the balcony and realized no one was stopping her.

She didn't have the courage to climb onto the windowsill.

So she just stood there awkwardly.

My husband understood her intention.

He just looked at her coldly, saying nothing.

I almost wanted to laugh. If you're going to pretend to do something drastic, at least make it convincing. You can't even climb up.

I feigned concern and went to stop her.

"Mom, please don't do anything reckless. What will you do with such a big belly?"

"Your secret will come out anyway."

"Father-in-law will be furious."

She shot me an angry glare.

My husband snorted.

In the end, my husband agreed to her request.

I also agreed, which made him feel very sorry for me.

He was very considerate towards me.

Without keeping the child, the pretense couldn't continue.

Soon, I went into labor.

Just like before, my mother-in-law insisted on being with me.

My husband hurriedly took us to the hospital.

Once there, she was taken aback.

Aunt Lydia was waiting at the hospital.

My husband was also shocked.

I looked at her with a cold smile.

I had secretly set up a small account long ago.

As soon as I went into labor, I sent a photo of her large belly to Aunt Lydia.

I even thoughtfully noted the hospital.

Aunt Lydia stared intently at her belly.

Suddenly, she rushed over and slapped her hard.

She didn't react in time and fell to the ground.

Soon, cold sweat was beading on her forehead. She clutched her belly, curled up on the floor, and kept groaning in pain.
Many onlookers gathered around Aunt Lydia, whispering among themselves.

"How can you hit a pregnant woman?"

"Is the baby her husband's?"

"She's so old, yet still having kids—absolutely shameless."
