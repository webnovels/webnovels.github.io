My boyfriend is stunningly handsome, successful, and rich. After three years together, I decided it was finally time to bring him home for the holidays to meet my parents.

But the moment I posted a photo of Liam and me in our family group chat, it exploded!

"Chloe, I get that you might be desperate, but you can't just date anyone who's breathing!"

"Are you trying to skip those blind dates by bringing home some random guy just to upset Mom?"

I stared blankly at Liam beside me.

He's over six feet tall, with chiseled abs, wearing a custom Armani suit.

But the next second, Dad sent back the photo I'd just posted with a message.

"Chloe, are you blind? You picked such a short, ugly loser for a boyfriend?"

I looked at the man in the photo. He looked old, balding, with a beer belly, and barely five feet tall.

He was wearing shabby clothes and holding me in a creepy way.

But the photo wasn't AI-generated, and there were no signs of editing.

I looked up at Liam again, still standing there like a Greek statue.

I kept asking people around me, but everyone described Liam as short, poor, and ugly.

I could not handle the shock. I slowly began to lose my mind.

Eventually, I was sent to a mental hospital and accidentally killed by another patient.

When I opened my eyes again, I was back at the moment I was about to introduce my boyfriend publicly.
