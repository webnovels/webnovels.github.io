This is absolutely ridiculous!
I was on my way to graduation, got hit by a car, and now I’m being accused of “faking an accident” to force a divorce from Zach?
Either I’ve lost my mind, or Zach has.
“Wait, Zach!”
Before I could finish, a little kid suddenly ran into the room, jumping right into Zach’s arms.
Me: ???
Wow, this kid is so adorable. I reached out with my good arm to pinch his cheek, but he immediately hid behind Zach, clearly scared.
“Sorry, little guy. You’re just too cute. I couldn’t help myself.”
Zach shot me a disapproving look. It suddenly hit me that I hadn’t even gotten to the main point.
“Zach, this might sound crazy, but I don’t remember anything you’re talking about. All I recall is being on my way to the graduation ceremony...”
Before I could finish, Zach cut me off impatiently.
“So, you’re telling me you’ve lost your memory?”
Amnesia?
Yes, that must be it. Amnesia is the only explanation for why I don’t remember any of this.
I nodded sincerely.
Zach’s icy expression didn’t soften. He pulled a document from his bag and tossed it onto my lap.
“This is the divorce agreement. The terms are exactly as you requested. If you have no objections, just sign it.”
I opened my mouth to respond, but no words came out.
The little boy in Zach’s arms looked sad, his lips trembling.
“Zach, shouldn’t we avoid discussing such topics in front of a child? It’s not good for his emotional well-being.”
“How considerate of you, Jennifer,” Zach sneered. “That’s our child.”
...
“And yet, when you were having dinner with another man, did you ever think about how that might affect his emotional well-being?”
I hadn’t even processed his first sentence when the second one hit me like a ton of bricks. I stared at the little boy in disbelief.
So, I didn’t just get married—I have a child too?
But the little guy paid no attention to me. He buried his face in Zach’s neck, refusing to even look my way.
Too much information. My brain couldn’t handle it. I was officially out of commission.
