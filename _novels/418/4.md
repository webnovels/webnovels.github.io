I couldn’t sleep. I just lay there, staring wide-eyed at the ceiling until dawn.
Around 7 a.m., I heard Zach's voice outside, speaking to a woman who kept saying "okay, okay."
It was probably the nanny, I guessed.
A little while later, the front door closed, and I heard the sound of the car engine starting. Zach had gone to work.
I stayed in bed, staring at the ceiling while my mind raced.
I’ve never been an outgoing person—if I were, I wouldn’t have been crushing on Zach for so many years without saying a word.
But now, not only had my crush succeeded, but I had also become his wife. Along with the shock, there was a sense of joy I couldn’t suppress.
I thought this was my one big chance from fate, but it turns out I played my cards terribly in this marriage.
Emotional intelligence really is my weakness.
As I was lost in thought, the bedroom door suddenly opened.
A woman in a nanny uniform walked in. The moment she saw me, she apologized repeatedly.
"I'm so sorry! I didn’t think anyone was in here."
"It’s fine, I was just about to get up."
I smiled at her, and she breathed a sigh of relief as she slowly walked into the room.
"Mr. Warren left for work. I assumed no one was here since you usually slept in your own room."
My own room?
Suddenly, memories from the day before came rushing back. There was definitely a bed in that other room where I grabbed my clothes.
So, I had been sleeping in a different room all this time?
Does that mean Zach and I had been living separately?
It all made sense now—Zach’s strange behavior yesterday.
Oh no, this is embarrassing.
I buried my face in my hands, and a flood of regret washed over me.
Hearing our conversation, Cooper came running to the bedroom door, his bare feet thumping against the floor. He stood there looking at me with big, expectant eyes, but didn’t dare come in.
"Cooper, come to mommy."
I gently called to him, holding out my arms.
The little guy’s face lit up with excitement. He sprinted across the room and jumped into my arms, knocking me onto the bed.
He flashed a big smile, his tiny teeth showing.
“Mommy,” he said, nuzzling his head against my chest.
My heart melted.
No matter how much Zach might hate me right now, Cooper is still my baby. I would always love him.
After saying goodbye to the nanny, I took Cooper out for some quality time together.
We went shopping. I bought him a bunch of cute clothes and treated myself to some more “normal” outfits.
Honestly, the clothes I wore after getting married were a bit... much.
Holding Cooper in my arms, I watched as he happily ate his ice cream, his face smudged with cream. I gently wiped his mouth.
“Cooper, what was Mommy like before?”
Cooper pouted, his voice soft with a hint of sadness.
“You didn’t like Cooper.”
Then he added, “You were always so mean.”
Kids don’t lie. Hearing this broke my heart.
So, I really had changed that much, to the point where even I wouldn’t recognize myself?
Then why did Zach marry me?
Was it out of love?
If so, he sure had an interesting taste.
“Mommy, I want that!”
Sitting in my lap, Cooper pointed at a McDonald’s poster advertising the latest family meal.
Well, kids will be kids—can’t resist the temptation.
Me: “Let’s buy it!”
An hour later, Cooper and I sat side by side on the couch in Zach’s office, looking like two children who had just been caught misbehaving.
