It took me a whole day to wrap my head around everything.
It seems I really did lose my memory.
I’m still me, and Zach is still Zach.
The only difference is—we’re married, and we have a kid.
But that divorce agreement sitting on the bed speaks volumes: there’s clearly a problem with our marriage.
The problem is... did I cheat?
No way, right? Why would I cheat on Zach? He’s good-looking and smart.
I must’ve been crazy.
So, what went wrong? How can I get my memory back?
I scratched my head, completely frustrated.
“Mommy.”
A tiny voice came from the door. I looked up to see a small face peeking through the slightly open door.
“Daddy said you need to disinfect your hand. Here’s the iodine. He said you should do it yourself.”
The little boy held a bottle tightly in his tiny hands.
I gestured for him to come closer. “Mommy’s hand hurts. Can you bring it over for me?”
The boy hesitated for a moment but eventually nodded and shuffled over to the bed, placing the iodine on the bedside table.
I pulled him onto my lap and studied his features. His eyes were big and round like mine, his nose straight like Zach’s, and his face... a perfect combination of both of us.
This was our son.
I couldn’t resist hugging him tight and planting a big kiss on his cheek. He smelled so sweet and innocent—absolutely irresistible.
When I looked up, his face was bright red.
He froze for a moment before wrapping his little arms around my neck and hugging me back tightly.
He leaned in and whispered in my ear, “Mommy, you smell nice.”
This little guy is the sweetest thing ever.
As I basked in the joy of my son’s affection, the door opened again.
Zach entered, his familiar presence filling the room.
“Daddy!”
The little boy immediately ran to Zach and held his arms out, waiting for him to pick him up.
Zach had just showered, wearing casual loungewear, looking effortlessly sexy and relaxed.
His hair was still slightly damp, with droplets running down his neck and disappearing into his collar.
I swallowed. This man was dangerously attractive.
As he came closer, my heart started racing.
But then Zach’s words shattered my moment of bliss.
“Jennifer, don’t you think it’s a little late to start being a good mom to Cooper?”
“I... I didn’t mean to...”
I tried to explain, but the look on Zach’s face told me he wouldn’t believe a word I said.
So, I stayed silent.
“Whatever. Do what you need to do. I’m heading out.”
As I left the study, Cooper peeked out from Zach’s neck and gave me a glance.
Watching the two of them so close, a wave of sadness washed over me.
What good are a husband and child if my husband doesn’t love me? Even my son seems closer to him.
I started questioning everything. Why did we get married in the first place? Why did we have a child?
Outside, the full moon hung high in the sky. The night breeze blew through the balcony, scattering my emotions.
Nothing has changed.
Except for me.
