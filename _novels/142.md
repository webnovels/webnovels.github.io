I knew that when the power went out in the ICU at midnight, 200 elderly patients on ventilators would slowly suffocate to death.

But at 12:01 AM, when my daughter Emily frantically asked me what to do, I calmly played on my phone, completely unconcerned.

That's because in my previous life, as soon as the power went out, I immediately went to connect the backup power supply and checked on each elderly patient one by one.

After finishing, I passed out from exhaustion.

At some point, Emily burst in with her colleagues and forcibly dragged me up.

"Dad, isn't saving lives your sacred duty? How could you cruelly murder those elderly patients?"

That's when I learned that all the elderly patients in the ICU had suffocated to death without exception.

The police arrested me, saying I was the only one inside and my fingerprints were found on the power switch.

Emily produced a video to actively assist the investigation: "My dad often complained that the elderly patients in the ICU were troublesome and wished they would all die."

My wife Linda bitterly accused me, "You killed so many elderly people - you don't deserve to be a doctor!"

Enraged family members of the patients swarmed and beat me to death.

I died not understanding - the ventilators were working normally, so how did those elderly patients suffocate?

Why did my own daughter produce a fake video to frame me?

When I opened my eyes again, I had returned to the moment the power went out.
