When I fully realized I had been reborn, I was already being dragged back into the house by my brother.
In his left hand, he still held the knife. His right hand fumbled by the doorframe for something—probably rope. Not finding any, he yanked off his own tie and used it to bind my wrists.
"You're not seeing Josh again."
Josh. My fiancé. The man who had just asked me to drug my brother.
I stayed quiet, watching as my brother meticulously tied the knot. He even padded the tie with a bit of cloth so it wouldn't chafe.
"Liam," I called softly, grabbing at his fingers.
He froze for a moment. In my past life, I couldn't even stand to touch him. My gesture now threw him off for a second or two.
Then his hand pressed over my mouth.
"Shut up."
"If you so much as beg for that bastard, I'll kill him myself."
