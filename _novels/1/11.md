It was the middle of the night, and I couldn't sleep. My body felt like it was burning up.
I got up and knocked on Liam's door.
"Liam… I think I have a fever," I mumbled, my vision blurry as I looked up at him.
For a moment, random thoughts filled my foggy mind—Liam really was handsome. If he'd gone to school like a normal person, I bet a lot of girls would've fallen for him.
But unfortunately, Liam had given up everything for me.
Without hesitation, he scooped me up in his arms.
"We're going to the hospital."
He didn't even stop to think. His coat was already wrapped around me as he carried me out the door.
He pressed his hand to my forehead, and I felt his fingers tremble.
I must've been really hot.
Liam always panicked because of me.
He was so perfect in every way, but it seemed like God had given him a weakness—me.
His entire life had been ruined because of me.
