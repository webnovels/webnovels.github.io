I swear, this was the last time I'd ever lie to Liam.

I turned the shower to the coldest setting and let the icy water wash over me. While drying my hair, I blasted it with cold air, making sure the chill seeped straight into my bones.

My health had never been great, so it didn't take much for me to catch a cold.

As soon as I felt the cold settle into my sinuses, I sniffled, knowing I was on the verge of a fever.

When I walked out of the bathroom, towel in hand, Liam was sitting on the couch. His dark eyes locked onto me with a piercing intensity.

I stumbled toward him, letting out a dramatic "oh no" as I collapsed into his lap.

Even though it was sudden, Liam's arms instinctively came up to catch me.

For a moment, I felt like one of those seductive fox spirits from old folklore, luring a scholar into my trap.

But Liam's gaze was steady and unwavering, cold enough to make me shiver.

"Go to bed," he said flatly.

"..."

I squeezed his thigh, testing his patience.

His hand shot out to grab mine, holding it in place. I tilted my head, watching the way his throat moved as he swallowed.

"Why are you ignoring me?"

"Don't move," he warned. His voice was calm, but there was a flicker of something dangerous beneath it.

"Go to sleep."

This time, his tone carried a sharper edge, a clear warning.

"Liam, I'm so good to you. Don't you like it?" I whispered, shifting slightly on his lap and brushing my fingers against his throat.

His pupils dilated, and a low grunt escaped his lips.

He was still holding back. My brother, always holding back.

"Fine," I said, feigning disappointment. "Next time, I won't be so nice to you."

"After all, Liam, you're the one who keeps pushing me away."

Before I could finish my sentence, his hand gripped the back of my neck, pulling me forward.

His lips crashed into mine, cutting off whatever words I was about to say.

Sometimes, I really did feel sorry for Liam.

I was the one tied up, but he was the one who was truly trapped.

I wrapped my arms around his neck, pulling him closer. "Are you scared, Liam?" I murmured against his lips.

He didn't answer right away. When he finally did, his voice was hoarse.

"Yes," he admitted quietly.

"You're acting so strange, Lila. I'm terrified it's all a trap."

"But you know what? Even if you dug a pit and stood in front of it, smiling as you told me to jump…"

"I'd still jump."
