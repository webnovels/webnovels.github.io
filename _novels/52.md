Three years after leaving the country, I arrived at Capital Airport with my twin children.

The always cold CEO sent a message: "Returned?"

Without hesitation, I lied, "No, I'm still in the U.S., about to go to bed."

But in the blink of an eye, he was standing right in front of me, his gaze fixed intently on my two kids.

"Is this why you disappeared?"

"Do you realize I never agreed to the divorce? What you've done is betrayal!"

I let out a cold laugh and touched the prayer beads on his wrist.

"You didn't want to have children with me, so I found someone who did."

When we got married, Asher promised he loved me deeply. He said he'd do anything for me, except break his vows. But then, his first love returned.

She claimed that if she could make Asher break his vows nine times, I should willingly leave him.

I lost that challenge, utterly defeated.
