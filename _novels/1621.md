After the car accident, I saw words written by my long-deceased mother floating before my eyes.

"Baby, Declan slept with another woman before he married you!"

I was completely stunned.

Mother's words continued appearing before my eyes.

"In your past life, he destroyed you. After you married him, you were kidnapped and nearly killed, but he was too busy celebrating Rain's birthday with her!"

"Sweetheart, this time don't choose Declan. Choose the heir of the Pierce family - steady and loyal!"

The next second, Father walked into the lounge and laid out photos of heirs from several major families in front of me, asking me to pick a husband.

Without hesitation, I chose my sworn enemy, Adrian Pierce.

I'd always listened to Mother.

If Mother said Declan didn't love me, then I didn't want him anymore.


My father, the Don of our mafia family, looked at me hesitantly.

"Faye, you and the Harrington boy have always been at each other's throats. Are you sure you want to marry him? Think carefully - this determines control of the entire organization. There's no going back."

He'd established a rule: whichever family's heir married me would gain complete control of the Giovani family's power and resources.

Mrs. Harrington was also shocked and quickly tried to dissuade me.

"Faye, even though Declan lost his memory and forgot about you, didn't you love him the most? Why won't you wait for him? Maybe once you two are married, he'll remember everything."

Words from Mother appeared before my eyes:

"Nonsense! In your past life, that mistress Rain broke my baby's heirloom necklace, and my child didn't even complain much, but Declan threw her out of the family banquet. Poor thing almost got kidnapped outside!"

"It was Adrian who came to put a coat over my child and took her somewhere safe to rest. Sure, his words are harsh, but his heart is good."

At those words, my heart clenched painfully.

I didn't understand why Mother kept talking about a past life, kept mentioning things that happened, but her words felt like I'd lived through them myself. 

They made my chest tighten, like a boulder was crushing it.

Besides, Rain really was Declan's first love. They had a deep history, and I was just the one who came later.

"Father, I've made my choice. I want Adrian Pierce."

Father put away the photos and patted my shoulder.

"Alright, I respect your decision. In two days, I'll announce your engagement to Adrian to our world."

Words appeared before my eyes from Mother:

"That's right. This time my baby will definitely be happy."

Father went to discuss business with some senior members.

I changed my clothes, wanting to go out for a walk.

But I didn't expect to find three tall young men with distinct temperaments standing outside the door.

They'd all grown up with me and were candidates for my husband.

Declan was there too. Only Adrian was absent.

Jason walked over to me with a grin, curious.

"Faye, I heard the Don wants to choose one of us to marry you. Who did you pick?"

Marcus teased.

"Do you even need to ask? It's obviously Declan. Everyone in our world knows Faye is crazy about him, considers him her soulmate."

Declan glanced at me coolly.

"I don't remember what happened these past three years. I only remember that Rain is the love of my life."

"But I know that in those three years I've forgotten, we were together. Even though I don't love you now, I won't disobey orders. Once the marriage is arranged, I'll fulfill my duty."

Words from Mother appeared before my eyes:

"In your past life he used fake amnesia to openly mess around with Rain while stealing my baby's family territory and business, until he left my child with nothing and she died! Bad man, get lost!"

Looking at Declan's indifferent expression, without Mother's warning, I probably would have believed his lies.

I really did like him. I'd even thought he liked me back.

Like three years ago when he held that grand fireworks show for me.

His gaze was so full of feeling, his words so touching.

"Faye, I want to marry you. I want to make you the happiest woman alive."

I was so moved. I committed to him, and for three years our families grew close. But I never imagined that from the very beginning, he'd never cut ties with Rain.

He just couldn't afford to offend me, so he put on an act of loving me.
