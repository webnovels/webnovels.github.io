Moreover, they only ever had one son. Since when did they have twins?

"Sarah, Mom's here. There must be some misunderstanding. Don't be upset," said the woman facing me. She wore elaborate makeup, expensive perfume, and had a perfect manicure.

She approached me with ill intent and slapped me without hesitation.

"Who are you? How dare you try to scam us, claiming this is your husband? What backwoods hick are you?"

Seeing her strike me, the child couldn't hold back anymore.

He came up and kicked me.

"Who are you? Get out! You're not welcome here! Don't try to steal my dad!"

The child kicked hard, drawing blood on my leg.

I stood there motionless, my heart pierced as if by needles, aching all over.

"George, won't you say something? I know it's you."

"If you have some difficulty you can't speak of, just tell me, okay?"

"I've worked so hard to care for your parents for thirty years. Are all of you conspiring to deceive me?"

He opened his mouth to speak but was stopped by his father.

"Sarah, I think you're just too tired lately. How about this - you've cared for us for almost thirty years. After we die, that'll be the end of it. You don't need to care for us anymore. Go home now."

I stared at George with hollow eyes.

"Won't you say anything? Are you just going to abandon me like this? You did it thirty years ago, and now you're doing it again thirty years later? Doesn't your conscience hurt?"

George spoke coldly, "I'm sorry, sister-in-law. You've got the wrong person..."

Some sister-in-law. Some apology.

Thirty years of my youth, and all I get is "sister-in-law" and "sorry"?

I clung desperately to George's legs, wailing.

"George Grant, you heartless bastard! How could you abandon me like this? Now you've even married and had a child. Are you even human?"

He pried my fingers off one by one in disgust, spraying alcohol all over.

"Sister-in-law, don't push your luck. I'm not George Grant! You've got the wrong person."

George had changed... everything had changed.

My heart-wrenching cries drew the attention of other neighbors.

They gathered outside, pointing and whispering.

"How tragic, betraying her for thirty years... and then marrying someone else and having a kid."

"Yeah, and calling her 'sister-in-law' and claiming to be the twin brother. What a liar... absolute scum!"

"Look at that woman all dolled up. She's clearly no good. Probably slept her way to the top."

Sophia and George's faces turned ashen as they clenched their fists.

The next moment, he called the mental hospital impatiently.

"Hello doctor, there's a mentally ill person here. Please come take her away for treatment!"

I shook my head like a rattle drum.

"No... no!"

"George, do you know how hard it was for me to find you?"

I had put on the cleanest outfit from my closet, fixed my hair, and rushed over as fast as I could.

Now he was accusing me of being mentally ill.

I stood up and looked at George with tear-filled eyes.

"You were the first person I ever loved, and the last. I did everything I could to care for your parents. But you conspired with them to deceive me. Doesn't your conscience hurt at all?"
