The doctors from the mental hospital got out of the ambulance and dragged me in.

I was older now, and these doctors were strong young men. No matter how much I struggled, it was useless.

"George, say something! Do you think locking me up will let you do whatever you want? Do you think it will change the fact that you're George Grant?"

I ranted and raved like a madwoman, cursing heaven and earth.

But he watched coldly, as if nothing was happening.

That's how I was taken to the mental hospital.

I heard their chilling voices in my ear.

"Mr. Grant said to torture her to within an inch of her life. She's old anyway, she won't die."

"He also said she's destroying his family, so we shouldn't go easy on her."

As they spoke, they slowly took off their clothes. Only then did I realize:

They weren't from the mental hospital at all, but thugs hired by George.

I curled up in the corner, hugging my knees and trembling.

"Please, let me go. I'm just a weak woman. I came to find my husband. There must be some misunderstanding!"

"Ahhhh!"

A steel pipe struck my leg as smoke filled the air.

"Begging won't help. We're just doing the job we were paid for!"

Sweat poured down my forehead in big drops as I gritted my teeth through the pain.

Did George really hate me this much?

No matter how I begged, they showed no mercy.

They only stopped when I passed out on the ground.

Faintly, I heard them calling George.

"Mr. Grant... we've beaten her pretty badly. About the money..."

George laughed coldly on the other end. "Good job. My life is happy and perfect. She insisted on butting in, so she has only herself to blame!"

Blood and tears mixed together, falling bitterly into my mouth.

Oh heavens, I loved someone with all my heart and soul.

Was that also wrong?

I kept an empty home, caring dutifully for his parents.

Is this really how it all ends?

I gasped for air like a dying fish.

The next moment, George called.

"Sarah Newman, this is what happens when you insist on opposing me. If there's a next time, don't expect to keep your life!"

"Everything between us is in the past. I'm happy now. Stop bothering me!"

As he finished speaking, a coquettish female voice came through the phone.

"George, your bath is ready. Come wash up."

After George hung up,

A commotion arose outside the vehicle.

A group of people with cameras started taking photos of me in my wretched state.

Rotten eggs, kitchen waste, and all sorts of trash were thrown at my face.

"Sisters, keep throwing! This woman ruined Sophia's happiness!"

"How dare an old hag like you try to compete! Shameless!"

"They're married with a son! Get lost already!"

Foul-smelling juices clung to my body. I weakly protested in a small voice:

"George and I were married first... It's not my fault..."

"I just gave him my whole heart..."

I blacked out and woke up in the hospital.

Opening my phone, I saw a flood of messages from Mrs. Grant.

"Stop harassing us. Here's $10,000 to end all ties between us!"

"My son is married with his own family now. You can leave."
