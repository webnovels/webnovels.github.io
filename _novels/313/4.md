“Ma’am, we didn’t let her go out. The VIPs outside haven’t seen her. Please, please, don’t tell Mr. Sterling.”

Ashley crossed her arms, scanning me up and down. “Chloe, I knew you were always trying to compete with me. Turns out you were eyeing my husband all along.”

I countered, “Ma’am, isn’t it *your* wedding today? What, did Mr. Sterling and the Sterling family not prepare a couture gown for you?”

“I, I was just coming for my hair and makeup, wasn’t I?” Ashley stammered.

“Everyone, come with me. There are no more private rooms at the Grand Imperial Hotel. I’ve arranged for everyone to have a meal at the hotel next door. Let’s all go there. Especially you, Chloe, don’t cause any more trouble here.”

Ashley was clearly feeling guilty. She was afraid things would get out of hand, so she wanted to get these people out of there quickly.

“Since we’re already here, why don’t you go say hello to Mr. Sterling?” I asked.

Ashley grew agitated. “My husband is very busy! Let’s go, now!”

Seeing her anxious made me want to laugh.

“What are you laughing at?! We haven’t dealt with you yet! Ma’am, we can’t let her walk out dressed like this. How about we just strip her of that wedding dress?” Brenda suggested.

“You wouldn’t dare.”

“What wouldn’t I dare do?! If Mr. Sterling sees this, our entire department will be in big trouble!”

Brenda said, then lunged at me, trying to pull off my headpiece.

My golden tiara was brutally yanked off, my scalp stinging with pain. “Brenda, are you crazy?! I told you this is *my* wedding! Ashley is a fraud, *I* am…”

I didn’t even finish my sentence when Ashley slapped me.

“You’re right! Strip her of that wedding dress, and then throw her out!”

At her words, Mr. Davies’ repulsive gaze lingered on me, full of malicious intent and offense.

I recoiled, trying to warn him off with my eyes, but he showed no sign of stopping.

“The lady’s orders, I have to obey them, don’t I? Who told you to wear a wedding dress to your doom?”

My mind raced, frantically trying to figure out how to escape this terrible situation.

I wanted to scream for help, but Mr. Davies quickly covered my mouth, holding it shut.

“Go ahead and scream! Everyone here works for the lady. Who’s going to help you? You might as well just take off your clothes quietly!”

As he spoke, he reached for my waist. The wedding dress was strapless, easily torn off. I clung to it with all my might, struggling desperately to break free, but the strength difference was too great. I was pinned to the ground, unmoving.

Just then, the bridal suite door opened again.

“Ma’am, your…” Mrs. Miller saw the scene and dropped the tray she was carrying with a clatter.

I saw my savior and screamed at her, “Mrs. Miller, tell them who the *real* Mrs. Sterling is!”

Brenda laughed. “Does she even need to ask? I think you’ve lost your mind! Mrs. Miller, this lowlife dared to wear a wedding dress and cause trouble. Just tell her who the *real* Mrs. Sterling is, and make her give up!”

“Exactly! This person has been causing trouble for our Mrs. Sterling at the company. We absolutely cannot let her off today!”

Mrs. Miller stood there, her eyes darting back and forth between me and Ashley.

She looked at Ashley, as if she were afraid of something.

Chapter 
“Mrs. Miller, I advise you to think carefully before you speak. Today is my wedding, and I’ll be taking these colleagues to another hotel in a moment.”

Mrs. Miller bit her lip, her eyes on me filled with a strange mix of confusion, guilt, and reluctance.
