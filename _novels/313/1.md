To better blend in with my husband’s company, I decided to go undercover as an intern.

During the morning meeting, Mr. Davies, our manager, mysteriously announced some big news:

“Listen up, everyone, I’ve got a secret! Mrs. Sterling herself is interning here, and she’s been assigned to our department! So you all better be on your best behavior, keep your eyes open, and be proactive, got it?”

Everyone answered in unison, and I felt a bit awkward, so I started to say, “Actually, you don’t really need to…”

I didn’t even finish my sentence before he cut me off with a stern lecture.

“What do you know? If we don’t treat Mrs. Sterling right, our whole department could be facing a major shake-up!”

“Exactly! You just graduated college, right? No wonder you don’t get it. You better work hard, don’t drag us down.”

“If we get on Mrs. Sterling’s good side, promotions and raises will be a piece of cake!”

Remembering I was supposed to be incognito and they hadn't recognized me, I just nodded along. “Yes, yes, I’ll listen to the manager.”

After the meeting, I found an empty desk. The moment my butt hit the chair, a male voice yelled at me:

“Chloe! What are you doing?! Is that a seat you can just take?!”

I turned to see Mr. Davies, the department manager, yelling at me.

I looked at the workstation in front of me. I wasn’t even in *his* seat, so what was the problem?

Mr. Davies came over and yanked me up from the chair. “Your spot is in the back! This prime spot, with the great lighting, is for our Mrs. Sterling!”

Just as I stood there, utterly confused, the intern who started with me walked over, carrying some files. She looked down at me, a smirk on her face.

Mr. Davies, ever the eager beaver, had already pulled me aside and was now beaming at her. “Next time you need any files, just tell me. No need for you to bother getting them yourself.”

Wasn’t this Ashley, my old classmate?

I waved at her, but she completely ignored me.

Ashley glanced at her cup, and Mr. Davies immediately understood. He turned to me and snapped:

“What are you staring at? Go make her a coffee, now!”

Thinking I shouldn't get fired on my first day, I swallowed my pride and went to get Ashley’s coffee.

“Wait,” Ashley said, haughtily crossing her legs. “I want the hand-ground coffee from downstairs. Be a dear and go get it for me.”

“Sure, I’ll go now.”

It was pouring rain outside, and that quick trip soaked my pants from the knees down.

She took a sip, then promptly poured the coffee all over me. “I said hand-ground, didn’t I? Are you deaf?!”

The commotion made the other colleagues rush over, concerned:

“Ma’am, what happened? Wasn’t the coffee to your liking?”

“So clumsy, I wonder how she even got hired here. Go get another one!”

I forced a laugh. “How are you all so sure *she’s* Mrs. Sterling?”
