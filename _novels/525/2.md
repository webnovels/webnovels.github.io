Outside, Chloe looped her arm through mine, just like she always did, chatting and laughing.

But she’d just sided with Liam. They were clearly hooking up. I pulled my arm away with disgust. She flinched, then pretended it didn't bother her.

Suddenly, she giggled, pulling out her phone and letting out a gasp of envy.

"Asher! Look at this bag! It's gorgeous!"

She shoved her phone screen in my face. It was a designer bag worth thousands.

Seeing my silence, she pouted cutely, mumbling, "Ugh, it's way too expensive. I guess I can only dream."

"Even though everyone else in class has one, there's nothing I can do."

Her eyes welled up, threatening to spill over.

I scoffed inwardly. In my past life, I’d been completely taken in by that innocent, pitiful act of hers.

She always made me feel like I owed her something, mentioning how other people had new bags and new makeup.

Every time I saw her look so miserable, my heart would soften, and I’d want to do everything in my power to make her happy. So, despite being financially strapped, I would work multiple part-time jobs, eating only ramen and cheap sandwiches for days, just to scrape together enough money for her gifts.

I still remembered that rainy winter day. I was out with an umbrella, handing out flyers, soaking wet and utterly miserable. My hands and feet were numb with cold, but I forced myself to visit every shop, humbly begging them to take a look at the flyers.

I’d only made fifty bucks that afternoon, but the bag she wanted cost fifteen hundred.

Later, walking home from work, I passed a fried chicken place. My legs felt heavy, glued to the spot, as I stared longingly at the golden fried chicken, practically drooling.

But I thought of her gift and her happy smile, and I held back, even though I hadn’t eaten meat in six months.

After a month, I finally saved enough to buy the bag and gave it to her as her birthday gift.

She giggled with delight when she received it, spinning around, saying she was the happiest girl in the world.

At the time, I thought all my hardship was worth it. Because for someone who grew up in an orphanage like me, she was my only family, the only girl in my heart.

Now, looking back, I just feel utterly stupid. A true lover wouldn’t let you go hungry for days, wouldn’t ignore your struggles, wouldn’t be clueless about your whereabouts.

She had only ever been using me.

Silence stretched between us. Seeing my indifferent expression, she looked a little lost, on the verge of tears.

I frowned, letting out a weary sigh. "Chloe, I'm out of cash."

"I can't even afford a meal tomorrow."

Her body stiffened. She forced a twitch of a smile, but no words came out.

It wasn’t until her phone rang that she quickly said, "Asher, I think my roommate is looking for me. I gotta go."

She wiped her eyes, then turned and scurried away. Watching her fleeing back, I let out a soft, mocking laugh.

I’d skip meals for what she wanted, but she wouldn’t even spare me enough for one meal. I truly was a pathetic clown.

I clenched my fists, the hatred in my heart deepening. Looking at the smooth bead around my neck, I decided it was time to get things back on track.

I was going to claim my true identity.
