In my past life, my girlfriend tricked me into meeting at a guesthouse, claiming it was for my birthday. After she and Liam Thorne drugged my drinks until I passed out, I woke up tied to the top floor of a high-rise.

My eyes fluttered open, slowly clearing. Liam stood there, his arm around Chloe Miller, both of them staring down at me with utter contempt.

"Awake, are we?" she said, her voice dripping with venom. "Good. Any last words? If I'm feeling generous, I might even grant one."

They both chuckled, leaning into each other. Chloe’s sharp, hyena-like laughter sent shivers down my spine. I’d never seen her like this before.

The wind on the rooftop was fierce, whipping against my face, filling me with dread.

I turned my head, gazing down at the dizzying heights and the tiny, ant-like figures below. My heart hammered with terror.

One step, and I would plummet from this building, splattering into a bloody mess on the pavement below.

The image of that gruesome scene made me tremble. I glared back at them. They were still grinning, as if my life meant nothing.

My fear morphed into a burning rage. I roared at her.

"Chloe Miller!"

"I was so good to you! Why would you betray me? How could you be so cruel?!"

They wanted me dead, and I didn't even know why.

My legs began to give out, my mind shattering with despair.

One was the girlfriend I’d loved for three years, the other, my childhood best friend.

"Why?!"

Her eyes turned vicious as she stepped closer.

"Because you're a worthless garbage! Poor, and utterly worthless. Why would I ever be with you?"

"Do you know, Asher, every time my friends asked about my boyfriend, I couldn't even bring myself to talk about you."

"You were an embarrassment!"

I stared up at her, disbelief etched across my face.

Behind her, Liam Thorne smirked, slowly walking toward me.

A large hand pressed down on my head, pushing me closer to the edge. My eyes burned red with defiance as I glared back at him.

"Since you're so pathetic, I'll tell you a little secret, Asher."

"No, wait, it should be Asher Thorne, right? The Thorne family's—second young master."

I gasped, my tense body went slack. I almost tumbled off the building. As I steadied myself, I finally saw what he held in his hand.

It was the carved bead I’d worn around my neck for years! The one he'd been asking me for!

Could it be?!

A wave of shock slammed into me. I met his smiling eyes.

He'd used this bead to claim my identity, to become the young master in my place!

"Liam Thorne! You treacherous bastard!"

I roared at him, my voice raw and hoarse.

"Hahahaha! Looks like you figured it out! Let me tell you, Asher, you deserved every bit of it!"

"You have to die. Only then can I truly rest easy."

He stepped closer, and Chloe, still smiling, joined him.

Knowing the truth, tears of bitter rage streamed down my face. I stopped struggling, my heart filled with hatred for them, and even more, for my own stupidity!

"Thud—"

They both shoved me. I plunged into the air, clutching my fists, closing my eyes, my heart burning with vengeful hate…

"Asher?!"

My eyes snapped open. A hand waved suddenly in front of my face. The raw agony of that last moment made my body tremble, and I instinctively grabbed the nearby table for support.

My chest heaved, and I gasped for air, desperate to fill my lungs.

When I calmed down, I looked around, slowly realizing that I hadn't died.

The vivid terror and burning fury still seared through me. My body still trembled, and I wrapped my arms around myself.

"What's wrong, Asher? You look so pale."

I snapped back to reality. Liam Thorne and Chloe Miller, those two dreadful figures, were standing right in front of me.

Chloe reached out a hand, a worried look on her face, to wipe the beads of sweat from my forehead. But recalling her monstrous grin on the rooftop sent a cold shiver down my spine.

I dodged her hand, taking a step back.

"So, Asher, can I have that bead?" Liam asked, his handsome face creased with a slight frown.

I lowered my gaze, picking up the smooth, brown bead hanging around my neck. My initial 'A' was carved into it.

My mind raced. I was back. Back to the day he'd asked for this very bead.

I remembered then. His birthday was approaching, and he’d outright asked for it. He claimed he’d been having bad luck lately and wanted something to bring him good fortune, and my bead had caught his eye.

My heart lurched. I clutched it tighter.

Seeing my nervous expression, he actually tried to grab it. He tugged at the cord around my neck, refusing to let go. I tightened my grip on the bead, glaring at him, seething.

"No!" I roared.

My drastic reaction made both of them look up in surprise. Liam flinched, staring at me with stunned disbelief.

It was then I realized how loud I’d been. It was probably the first time I'd ever raised my voice like that.

"Asher, it's just a bead, right? Just give it to Liam," Chloe said.

"He’s been so unlucky lately. He’s been sick three times this month and still isn’t feeling well."

Three times in one month? I scoffed inwardly. So, they were already hooking up back then? She remembered the exact number of times he’d been sick.

"No…" My anger from earlier had faded, and I weakly pushed back. Seeing my softened demeanor, Liam's tense posture visibly relaxed, as if he’d let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding.

He’d been wary of me.

"I'm sorry, Liam, but I've worn this since I was a kid. I can't imagine being without it."

"I'll get you a different gift."

Silence hung in the air. I wondered if he knew the significance of this family keepsake yet.

It wasn't until I turned to leave that I caught his reflection in a mirror behind me—his face twisting into a malicious sneer, his eyes dark with menace. Only then did I realize.

He knew. And he was doing this on purpose.
