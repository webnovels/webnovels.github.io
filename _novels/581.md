My brother hated me for ten years.  
The last time we argued, I left alone on a long journey but unexpectedly encountered an earthquake.  
Just as I was about to be struck by a hotel chandelier, my brother suddenly appeared and stood in front of me.
“Dolores, run out quickly, don't look back!”  
The chandelier crashed down, shattering his spine, but he gave me a relieved smile.  
“Mom and Dad asked me to take good care of you, and I did.”  
“If there's a next life, I hope you don't appear before our family again.”  
I was held tightly by someone, watching helplessly as my brother was completely buried under the rubble.
That night, having lost my last relative, I jumped into the river without hesitation.  
When I opened my eyes again, I had returned to the day we were reunited.  
I saw my brother waiting outside the police station. I walked toward him but passed by without stopping.  
I called out to a boy behind him: “Brother.”
…  
“Don’t you remember anything at all?”  
The policewoman held her pen and looked at me, not wanting to miss any details.  
“Think again. For example, what was your surname? Where did you live? Who was in your family?”  
“You were already seven or eight years old when you were abducted. You should have some memories.”  
I lowered my eyelids and spoke slowly.
“I was beaten constantly there. Once, I was hit on the head and fainted. When I woke up, I couldn't remember anything.”  
The policewoman's eyes suddenly filled with sympathy and pity.  
She put down her pen, “It's okay. If you remember anything later, you can contact us anytime.”  
I walked out of the police station and was about to head toward the temporary guesthouse they had arranged for me.  
But then I saw a familiar figure rushing toward me.
My brother?  
My heart skipped a beat.  
In my previous life, it was the police who contacted the Anderson Family, and Alfred Anderson reluctantly came to pick me up.  
Why was he here so soon this time?  
Alfred saw me, his eyes lit up, and he hurried over to me in two strides.  
I was about to speak, but he beat me to it.  
“I warn you, don't try to claim any connections. The Anderson Family already has a daughter.”
I suddenly understood.  
So Alfred had also been reborn. No wonder…  
He was afraid I would go back and claim kinship like in my previous life, so he acted first to stop me.  
My heart ached, but I looked up and feigned confusion,  
“Who are you? What do you mean by ‘the Anderson Family’?”  
Hearing this, Alfred’s expression turned suspicious.
“What are you up to now?”  
I pointed to my head and said bluntly,  
“I really don’t know you. I was injured here before, and I can’t remember many things.”  
Hearing that I was injured, a flash of guilt crossed Alfred’s eyes, but it quickly vanished.  
“Whether you’re genuinely amnesic or faking it, just know that the Anderson Family isn’t a place you should go.”
He paused for a moment before speaking again.  
"Although we have never met before, considering your pitiful situation, I can give you some money and find you a house, enough for you to live on your own until you reach adulthood. As long as you don't talk nonsense in front of the police and disturb my family, that would be fine."  
I shook my head,  
“Thank you, but I don't need it.”
Ignoring his stunned gaze, I got into the car.  
Thinking back to Alfred’s last words before he died, he had smiled and said he could finally reunite with his parents and sister.  
My heart ached unbearably.  
He had risked his life to save me.  
But in his heart, his sister was only another…  
Since the four of them were happier without me,  
then let them continue to be happy in this life.

At the guesthouse, I lay in bed but couldn't sleep.
Gazing at the pitch-black night sky outside the window, memories flooded back like a tidal wave.
In my previous life, it was also this year that the police rescued me from a small place which I couldn’t name.
I cried out my parents' names and address, believing I could finally go home.
But when I was returned, I found a stranger girl had taken my place.
My parents awkwardly explained that after I was abducted, they were so heartbroken that they adopted her.
Her name was Elaine.
They looked at me with a complicated expression, as if I were a stranger who had suddenly intruded into their lives.
Instead, they were gentle and affectionate toward the girl, as if she were their true daughter.
But… but they used to love me the most!
I broke down, screaming hysterically.
I pointed at the girl and called her a thief, saying she had stolen the home that should have been mine.  
My parents scolded me, saying I was being unreasonable.  
I cried uncontrollably, my voice hoarse from screaming.  
“But I suffered so much—why should she get to enjoy a happy life?!”  
My parents looked at me in silence, their eyes filled with pity but also hesitation.
Unexpectedly, that night, the girl left a letter and quietly departed.  
She said she was returning to the orphanage, not wanting this family to be torn apart because of her.  
I felt uneasy inside.  
My parents didn’t scold me, but sighed and said they would go to the orphanage to bring her back.  
My brother wanted to go with them, but they stopped him.
“Stay home and take care of your sister. She’s finally back, and you need to look after her.”  
In the end, they never returned.  
The car crashed on the way back from picking up the girl.  
All three of them were gone.  
From then on, my brother hated me with a passion.  
He hated me for ten whole years.  
Thinking of this, my throat tightened, and my eyes stung.
I wiped the tears from the corners of my eyes.  
Now that I couldn't return to the Anderson Family, I had to think about the path ahead.  
I wasn't even sixteen yet, so I needed a guardian.  
Suddenly, a name came to mind.  
Kerwin.  
A frail teenager who always stood in front of me to protect me when I was being beaten.  
In my previous life, if it weren't for him, I would have been defiled by the foolish son of the family who had bought me as a child bride.
When we were punished and locked in a pigsty, shivering with cold, he wrapped the last of his clothes around me.  
“From now on, I’m your older brother. I’ll protect you.”  
We endured countless difficult days together.  
But later, he was sold to another village.  
When I was rescued, the police said the people from that village had been saved before me.
In my previous life, I had wanted to find him.  
But sudden changes at home prevented me from going.  
In this life, I decided to find him.  
The next day, I went to the police station at dawn.  
“Uncle and Auntie, I remember where my home is.”  
After registering my information, I turned to leave the police station.  
But Alfred, who had rushed over, grabbed my wrist.
“You tricked me again! You were faking it all along!”  
“Why do you insist on returning to the Anderson Family? The Anderson Family doesn’t want you.”  
His voice trembled, as if he were suppressing immense anger.  
“Don’t you understand? I already have a younger sister. My parents spoil her rotten. They don’t need an extra daughter.”
I shook off his hand and continued walking out in silence.  
Alfred was so enraged by my attitude that his eyes turned red. He suddenly shouted,  
“Weren’t you trafficked? Why don’t you just stay in the village forever?”  
His hysterical expression was identical to the one he had after my parents died in my previous life, when he pointed at me and screamed,  
“Why didn’t you die in their place?”
It was exactly the same.  
I raised my hand and slapped him hard across the face.  
‘Smack!’  
The crisp sound of the slap made him fall silent for a moment.  
“Who do you think you’re talking to?”  
I stared at him and asked, one word at a time.  
“Do you think someone who was trafficked deserves to die out there?”
Alfred seemed to snap out of it from the slap.  
He stumbled back a step, his eyes filled with regret.  
“I’m sorry…”  
The policewoman beside me finally couldn’t take it anymore. She frowned and stepped in front of me.  
“Young man, how dare you speak like that? This girl is looking for her family. Who are you to interfere?”
Alfred remained silent for a moment, then coldly grabbed my arm.  
“You want to go home, don’t you? Let’s go.”  
But I broke free from his grip and hid behind the policewoman under his astonished gaze.  
“I do want to go home, but what does that have to do with you?”

“My brother's name is Kerwin, and he lives in Province S.”
I said to Alfred, one word at a time.
Alfred froze, then looked at me in disbelief.
“Dolores Anderson, you've become quite the character, haven't you?”
“Where did you get a brother named Kerwin?!”
The policewoman immediately pulled me behind her protectively and turned to ask me,
"Little girl, do you know him? ”
I shook my head, my voice soft,
“I don’t know him. And… my surname is Brown.”
Alfred’s expression froze in disbelief as he stared at me.
He suddenly seemed to understand something.
“You’re back too, aren’t you?”
I lowered my head, clutching the hem of my shirt.
“I don’t understand what you’re talking about.”
“Dolores!”
Alfred’s eyes blazed with hatred, “Do you think pretending to be stupid and amnesiac can erase the fact that you’re a murderer?”
“And you deliberately made up a fake name to deceive me,”
he sneered, “What, do you think I’ll panic?”
“I’ll tell you, you’re dreaming.”
He stepped closer, his eyes mocking,
“Fine, your brother’s name is Kerwin, right? Then go find him.”  
He stared at me smugly, as if certain I would panic.  
“You’re crazy!”  
The policewoman cursed, grabbed my hand, and pulled me into the police car. “Let’s go, don’t pay attention to him.”  
Alfred finally panicked, chasing after us and pounding on the car window,  
“Where are you going?”
But he only got a mouthful of exhaust fumes.
The car drove for a long time before finally stopping in front of a garden villa.
I was surprised.
I didn't expect Kerwin's family to be so wealthy.
Suddenly, I felt more confident about seeking refuge with him.
We knocked on the door and waited for a long time before someone opened it.
The man standing behind the door was tall and slender, with handsome features, but his complexion was pale and sickly.
His messy hair slightly covered his eyes, and his shirt sleeves were rolled up to his elbows, revealing his slender wrists.  
When he saw us, he paused,  
“Who are you?”  
“Brother, I’m your sister!”  
I threw myself into his arms.  
He stiffened but didn’t push me away immediately.  
“Dolores, have you lost your mind?”
Alfred suddenly rushed up the hallway, yanked me away, and pointed angrily at Kerwin,  
“What are you doing! Do you know who he is? Just throwing yourself into his arms? What if he’s a bad person?”  
Looking at Alfred’s weary appearance, he must have followed us all the way here.  
Just like in a past life when he secretly followed me and risked his life to save me.
I looked at him with an unclear expression.  
“He’s my brother. What right do you have to scold my brother?”  
Alfred laughed bitterly in anger, “He’s your brother? Dolores, do you have eyes?”  
I asked him back, one word at a time,  
“He’s not my brother. Are you?”  
I stared at him, and saw Alfred open his mouth, almost about to say “yes.”
But he stopped himself.  
He glared at me, then only gave a cold laugh,  
“You almost had me fooled. I said I’m not your brother. You don’t deserve to be my sister.”  
I curled my lips in self-mockery.  
The policewoman finally couldn’t take it anymore and interrupted sharply,  
“You two, who is her brother?!”

The moment I threw myself into Kerwin's arms,  
he had already recognized me.  
Looking at my pleading eyes, Kerwin sighed and turned to the policewoman,  
“I'm her brother. Thank you for helping me find my sister.”  
Alfred's expression turned incredulous.  
“Good, very good.”  
He glared at me,  
“This isn't something I forced you into. It's your own choice. Don't regret it later.”
Then he turned and left.  
Watching Alfred’s departing figure, a bitter sorrow welled up in my heart.  
Isn’t this exactly what he wanted?  
I won’t return to the Anderson Family.  
But why did he still look betrayed?  
After everyone had left, I whispered to Kerwin,  
“I’m sorry for causing you trouble.”
“Isn’t he your own brother?” Kerwin asked.  
“If it’s a family dispute,” Kerwin advised me, “go back once you’ve reconciled.”  
I shook my head, flashes of my past life flickering through my mind.  
I couldn’t go back.  
Just as I was about to speak, my peripheral vision caught sight of the medicine bottle on the table that hadn’t been put away yet.
After reading the label, my heart sank.  
Looking at the man with his head bowed and an unclear expression, I grabbed Kerwin’s hand.  
“You once said that if I had no family, you would be my brother and take care of me for the rest of your life.”  
My voice trembled,  
“Does that still hold true now?”  
Kerwin remained silent for a very long time, so long that I thought time had stopped.
Finally, he nodded,  
“It still holds true.”  
I happily threw myself into his arms.  
“From today onward, you’re my real brother, and I’m your only sister.”  
I looked up at him, “We’re each other’s family.”  
“Now… Brother, I’m hungry. I haven’t eaten all day.”
Kerwin clearly paused for a moment, “Alright, I’ll go buy some groceries. What do you want to eat?”  
“Creamy mushroom pasta , and anything else you want to buy is fine.”  
I said casually.  
Kerwin nodded and went out the door.  
I took the opportunity to pour all the medicine on the table into the drawer.  
Pretending I knew nothing.  
However, not long after, there was a knock on the door.  
“Why are you back so soon?”
I opened the door and saw Alfred standing there with a gloomy expression.  
“Why are you here?”  
Alfred grabbed my hand without saying a word and dragged me outside.  
“Come with me.”  
I shook off his hand. “Where are you taking me?”  
“Home! Dolores, you can't keep pretending forever! Do you really want to stay in a stranger's house without any explanation?”
Alfred’s voice suddenly sounded a bit tired.  
“Since we’re both back, let’s forget about what happened in the past. After you come home with me, behave yourself, and my parents and I won’t treat you badly. Don’t always think about competing with Elaine…”  
I interrupted Alfred.  
“What if I say that the condition for me to come home is that Elaine has to leave? Would you agree?”  
The air froze instantly.
Alfred looked at me in disbelief, then his eyes filled with hatred,  
“I knew it! You’re truly malicious by nature! Why do you insist on driving Elaine out?”  
“Let me tell you, don’t even think about it. Elaine has been with Dad and Mom for so many years; in their hearts, she’s already like their own daughter!”  
“See?” I sneered, “I’ve only made this hypothetical suggestion, and I haven’t done anything yet, but your reaction is already so intense.”
“From the very beginning, things between Elaine and me have never been fair!”  
My voice began to tremble,  
“Have you ever considered my feelings? Did I voluntarily allow myself to be trafficked? Do you know how much suffering I endured during those years I was trafficked?”  
“Why should I be expected to graciously accept that the love that rightfully belongs to me is being taken away by someone else?”  
“It was your own fault for being abducted because you were playful then!"
Alfred blurted out, “Who else is to blame?”  
I snapped my head up, my gaze as sharp as a knife.  
“Are you sure it was because I was being playful?”
