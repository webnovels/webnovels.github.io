"You won't?"

"You don't have a choice!"

"Someone grab the young miss and hold her down!" Felix ordered, calling for the house security when he saw my refusal.

I found myself surrounded, and shouted desperately, "Don't you dare!" But not a single person paid any attention to me.

They simply followed Felix's orders and forcefully held me in place.

I had almost forgotten - for the past few years, I had acted so dependent on these three men that everyone had come to believe all of the White family's assets would one day belong to them. They no longer showed me any respect.

My heart turned cold, and I stared at the three of them with increasing hatred.

"What's with that look? Apologize now!" Lucas demanded.

"Listen here, Aria White. Don't think we won't dare to do anything just because you're the young miss."

"You're going to be relying on us three in the future!"

Lucas's contemptuous gaze swept over me as he spoke mockingly.

His attitude was utterly disgusting. Who had given them the right to think this way?

I couldn't understand it at all. I tried to struggle free, but the hands holding me down only pressed harder.

They forced me to kowtow to Mia, only releasing me after I hit my head on the ground with a loud thud.

"This is just a small punishment for now," Felix warned.

"Be a good girl and listen to us from now on. Otherwise, you can forget about marrying any one of us!"

With those threatening words, Felix and the others left, surrounding Mia like she was the center of their universe.

I caught a clear glimpse of Mia's smug, taunting expression as they walked away.

I clenched my fists in fury.

Just then, my phone began to ring.

It was Ethan Young calling.

I answered, forcing myself to calm down.

"What is it?" I asked coolly.

"Nothing much. Just reminding my fiancée not to forget about choosing the wedding venue and dress," his deep voice resonated in my ear, momentarily making me forget my surroundings.

By the time I came back to my senses, he had already hung up.

This man sure moves fast!

Left with no choice, I got up from the floor and quickly tidied myself up before heading out.

I went to redesign the wedding venue I had originally prepared for the three of them long ago.

But to my surprise, those shameless men actually had the nerve to show up after being notified.
