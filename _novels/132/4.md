I stood outside the bridal shop for a full hour, watching them take group wedding photos with Mia.

They even did an art-themed shoot, splattering paint all over the dress.

With each stain, I felt a pang of regret for my past blindness.

When they finally finished, they threw the ruined dress at me.

"Go pick another one for yourself. Oh, and the wedding photos we'll be displaying will be of the four of us," Lucas taunted in my ear.

But I couldn't hear anything. All I could think was:

The wedding dress is ruined.

I returned home in a daze and collapsed onto my bed, unable to hold back my tears.

Knock knock.

A sudden knocking at the door startled me. I opened it to find my mother holding a mysterious box.

"What's this?" I asked.

"Open it and see," she replied with a secretive smile.

Following her instructions, I opened the box to find a wedding dress inside.

And most importantly, it was adorned with pink diamonds - my absolute favorite.

I couldn't help but caress it lovingly.

My mother watched me with a pleased expression.

"You know, this was sent over by Ethan. He's really put a lot of thought into it," she explained.

"And guess what? He designed it himself!"

Hearing those words made my heart skip a beat.

Suddenly, I felt that my decision to marry him was the right choice after all.

I tried on the wedding dress and found it fit perfectly.

I could almost imagine what it would be like standing next to Ethan.

This man... he certainly knows how to impress.

I bit back a smile as I sent him a selfie.

His reply came quickly.

After that, to avoid running into Felix and the others, I didn't leave the house at all in the days leading up to the wedding.

Soon enough, the big day arrived.

At 10 AM, the Young family's motorcade paraded through the entire city announcing the joyous news, with live broadcasts on various big screens.

It was clear how much Ethan valued me.

Meanwhile, Felix and the others were drinking with Mia at a club, watching the broadcast with cold smirks.

"I'd like to see where she finds a groom without us three," Felix sneered.

"Exactly. We need to teach her a lesson. We can always say we had urgent business if Mr. White gets angry. She'll cover for us anyway," Lucas added as he clinked glasses with the others.

On the big screen, I was already slowly walking up to the wedding altar.

I held a bouquet of Ethan's favorite lavender, my heart fluttering nervously as I waited for his arrival.

"Felix, is what you're doing really okay?" Mia asked, blinking innocently as she held her wine glass. But inwardly, she was secretly delighted.

The men, though feeling somewhat uneasy, stubbornly acted as if nothing was wrong.

When it was almost time, Felix stood up first, only to find Lucas frozen in place.

"What's wrong, Lucas?" Felix asked.

"Felix... it looks like Aria was telling the truth. The groom isn't one of us..." Lucas stammered.

Felix quickly looked up at the big screen.

He froze when he saw the figure walking towards me.

"Ethan Young!"
