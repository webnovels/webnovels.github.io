"Aria White, you really have no shame! Are you that desperate to get married? We just taught you a lesson and you're already here setting up the venue!" Lucas exclaimed, his face filled with disgust.

The others wore identical expressions of contempt.

I tried to keep my temper in check, wanting to explain, but before I could even open my mouth, Felix ordered the security guards who had followed them to start tearing everything down.

"Get rid of all these disgusting flowers!" he commanded.

"Replace them all with white roses - Mia's favorite."

"Aria White, even if you end up marrying one of us, the wedding will be done according to Mia's preferences. It's the least you owe her."

As he finished speaking, the flower arch I had just had set up was kicked down with one swift motion.

I was still trying to process what was happening, wondering what exactly I supposedly owed Mia.

"Felix Foster! My wedding isn't going to be with any of you three. You have no right to destroy my venue!" I finally managed to protest.

"Not with us three? Who are you trying to fool? The whole city knows how desperately in love with us you are!" Lucas sneered.

"Of course it's—" I tried to explain, but was cut off by another loud crash behind me.

I turned to see that the security guards had smashed the area where I had planned to display our wedding photos.

The others followed suit, destroying everything else in sight.

In the blink of an eye, half of the wedding venue had been wrecked.

"Stop it! What gives you the right to destroy my wedding venue? Who do you think you are?" I shouted desperately.

"Stop this right now!"

But my pleas fell on deaf ears. They continued their destruction without slowing down at all, completely ignoring my cries even as my voice grew hoarse.

I could only watch helplessly as the venue I had so carefully prepared was reduced to ruins.

Meanwhile, the culprits stood before me, nodding in satisfaction.

"Much better! Good riddance to all that eyesore," Felix remarked coldly.

"Let's go, we still need to help Mia make cupcakes!" Lucas said with a grin as he led the group away.

Leaving me alone, silently shedding tears amidst the wreckage.

It took me a while to compose myself and get up.

I didn't have time to confront them now. The most important thing was to redecorate the wedding venue and choose a dress.

Nothing else mattered. As for what they had done, I silently added it to the list of grievances in my heart.

Once everything was settled, I would make sure they paid for it all.

It took two more days to set up the wedding venue again.

My wedding to Ethan Young was drawing near.

I couldn't control the excitement in my heart. For the first time in days, I had a genuine smile on my face as I headed out to try on wedding dresses.

But when I arrived, I found Felix, Lucas, William and Mia already there.

The four of them were intimately wrapped up in each other, completely ignoring my presence.

And Mia was wearing the wedding dress I had carefully selected.

Felix, who was standing furthest out, was the first to notice my arrival. With an impatient look, he berated me:

"Why are you here? Did someone tip you off again?"

"You really can't live without us, can you? Still claiming you're not marrying one of us three, yet this is the exact wedding dress we picked out together!"

"Mia wanted to take photos with us but didn't have anything suitable to wear, so we're letting her borrow yours for now."

"Consider it a chance for you to make amends."

With that, he turned his attention back to Mia, joining Lucas and William in showering her with praise.

Every word they spoke was laced with insults aimed at me.

"Our Mia looks so beautiful in this. Much better than certain venomous-hearted people!"

"It's such a shame. If we didn't have to marry her, I'd want the four of us to be together forever."

Lucas couldn't help sighing, causing Mia's eyes to well up with tears as she comforted them.

"It's alright, Lucas. No matter who marries the young miss, the four of us will always be family."

I trembled with rage at the scene before me, gritting my teeth as I spoke,

"If you all love Mia so much that you'd casually take someone else's clothes for her, fine!"

"I'll make sure everyone sees just how shameless you are!"

With that, I raised my phone, ready to take a photo of them.

Seeing this, Felix angrily called for security to drag me away.

"She's gone mad! This crazy woman - get her out of here now!"

I was then unceremoniously thrown out, left to helplessly watch as the wedding dress I had so carefully chosen was worn by Mia Gray.

And there was nothing I could do about it.
