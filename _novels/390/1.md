"I'll be back soon."
But he never came back.
I stared at the watch lying silently in my palm.
It was the birthday gift I had given Jack last year.
He seemed very happy when he received it that day.
He hugged me from behind with one arm around my waist, resting his chin on my shoulder, using his free hand to play with the pocket watch.
After a while, he suddenly bit my neck like a puppy and said to me: "It's beautiful."
"I love it."
"And I love you. You're even more beautiful."
I didn't turn around.
His hand moved up, skillfully and swiftly starting to unbutton my shirt collar.
...
Who would have thought, less than a year later.
This pocket watch would return to my hands in this way.
As Jack's posthumous belonging.
My heart felt like it was being pricked by countless needles, a dense pain spreading.
I unconsciously bit my lower lip hard, tasting blood.
A moment later, I suddenly looked up and smiled at Jack's subordinate.
"Condolences? What do I have to grieve about?"
"He's dead, so he's dead," I paused, as if genuinely puzzled. "Is that something worth being sad over?"
Probably no one expected my words could be so harsh.
No one managed to see anything resembling sadness on my face after Jack's death.
I had long been accustomed to disguising myself.
Those few subordinates seemed slightly taken aback.
But in the end, they said nothing, bowed to me, and drove away.
