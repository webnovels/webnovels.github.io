A few days later, Chloe actually came to my office threatening suicide.

I looked at her helplessly. "Can't you make a scene somewhere else? People are trying to work here."

But Chloe's brain clearly couldn't comprehend the importance of work. She continued shouting:

"Kevin and I are truly in love. Why can't you just let us be together? Do I have to die for you to be satisfied?!"

I was confused. Wasn't I already agreeing to divorce? How was that not letting them be together?

What exactly did she want?

"Why did you cancel Kevin's credit cards? Don't you know we can't survive without money? How can you be so selfish!"

When Kevin rushed over, I rolled my eyes and said, "Oh, you're here. Your little mistress has been threatening suicide for an hour but hasn't even scratched herself. Better comfort her quick, or you'll inconvenience the cleaning staff getting off work."

Kevin's face turned ashen.

But it wasn't because he found Chloe embarrassing. He was upset at my indifference:

"Sophia, when did you become so cold-blooded..."

"You've really disappointed me..."

Mr. Chen was even more dramatic, his eyes rolling back as if about to faint:

"Sophia! You little beast! Are you only happy when you've driven our whole family to death?!"

She yelled loudly, and I replied even louder.

"Yep, thrilled."

The onlookers, not knowing the full story, actually started criticizing me:

"I can't believe it. Ms. Johnson seemed so capable at work, but behind closed doors she's so cold to her own family!"

"Yeah, she's driven that poor girl to the brink of suicide and she's still making sarcastic comments. You really can't judge a book by its cover!"

"Hmph! Who knows how she got that CEO position. Probably by sleeping with other men."

As the crowd's speculation grew more and more outrageous, Kevin cleared his throat and put on a magnanimous act:

"Sophia, you see how clear-sighted everyone is? They all know you're in the wrong. Stop making a fuss and come home with me. Who else would want you besides me?"

He reached out to grab my hand.

I laughed.

As if he was worthy of touching me.

I stepped back, and under his dissatisfied gaze, I slowly spoke:

"Do they know that in all our years of marriage, we've had no children because you have erectile dysfunction?"

The crowd fell silent, all ears perked up waiting for the juicy gossip.

"Sophia! What nonsense are you spouting?!"

"If you keep talking rubbish, I really won't take you back!"

The man's pride was thoroughly trampled in public.

I shrugged, cleared my throat, and repeated in a voice the whole office could hear:

"You have ED! You have ED! You have ED! You have ED!"

"I've been married to you for years and never experienced a woman's pleasure, all because..."

"You have erectile dysfunction!!!!"
