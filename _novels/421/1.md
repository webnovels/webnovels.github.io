In the photo, Kevin was leaning tenderly against Chloe's swollen belly, smiling with deep satisfaction.

I opened my contacts and called him.

The phone rang for a long time before he picked up.

"Hello? Honey?" His voice sounded guilty.

"How was the business dinner? Did you make some good connections? I'm here with some important investors. Just finished a round of talks, I'm exhausted..."

I replied with a laugh: "It went well. But I miss you so much right now. Can we video chat?"

There was no response from the other end. The two of them were clearly panicking.

"Baby, it's not convenient right now. Besides, who video calls their wife in the middle of a business meeting? It wouldn't leave a good impression on the clients."

"I know you miss me. Don't worry, I'll wrap up work as quickly as I can and spend more time with you tonight, okay?"

I didn't bother exposing his lies. Instead, I asked directly:

"Kevin, do you love me?"

Kevin hesitated for a few seconds before answering:

"Of course I love you, honey! Don't overthink things. You're the only woman I'll ever love!"

His voice was very quiet, clearly trying to prevent Chloe from overhearing.

Some "wife" I am. How pathetic.

I hung up the phone and headed straight to their love nest, knocking on the door.

"Sweetie, is that the food delivery? I..."

Kevin opened the door, his bare upper body still glistening with sweat.

He never expected to see me standing there.

He immediately tried to block the doorway with his body, attempting to obstruct my view.

"H-honey? What are you doing here... Aren't you supposed to be..."

He was utterly shocked.

"At the business dinner, right? Kevin, that's hardly important now, is it? Just like how you're not actually in a meeting."

I looked past him at Chloe. She instinctively covered her belly with both hands, stammering:

"Sophia... What brings you here..."

I knew she was waiting for me to confront her so she could play the victim.

But I didn't.

With a blank expression, I unlocked my phone screen and shoved that glaring photo right in Kevin's face.

I asked calmly:

"Honey, didn't you promise you'd never see her again?"

"Were you lying to me?"
