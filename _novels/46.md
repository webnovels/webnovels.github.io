After another disagreement with Lucas about marriage, he went to sleep in the guest room.

At 2 AM, I wanted to apologize. But as I approached the guest room door, I overheard him on the phone:

"Dating and marriage are two different things. Ivy can't handle the rules of high society. Not marrying her is for her own good."

"I don't have a suitable marriage prospect anyway, so I'm just taking it day by day. After all, she saved my life. I can't bring myself to break up with her..."

I didn't confront him. I just went back to our room and lay awake until dawn.

Early the next morning, I sat down across from Lucas's mother, Rachel:

"Is your previous offer still valid? I don't choose Lucas anymore. I want the money."
