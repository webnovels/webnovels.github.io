I carefully selected 999 red roses for Sophia Evans.

Her male secretary broke out in hives.

Sophia was furious. Using my mother's heirloom as bait, she forced me to fight a lion bare-handed.

She casually instructed her subordinates: "It doesn't matter if he dies. As long as it cleanses Ryan's bad luck."

I remained silent.

At the cost of 6 broken ribs and being mauled bloody by the lion,

I successfully retrieved the heirloom and calmly turned to leave.

Behind me, Sophia sneered: "He's nothing but a lowly bodyguard I keep. How could a dog ever leave its master?"

What Sophia didn't know was,

Someone had already bought out my contract for a high price.

This time, I was going to protect someone else.
