My five-year marriage, in that single moment, became a bitter mockery.

“For tomorrow’s monthly report meeting, I want Caleb to present your brand proposal.” My wife, Sarah, said without even looking up.

I put down the files I was sorting, thinking I’d misheard.

“What did you say?”

“Caleb just joined the company. He needs a chance to prove himself, and your proposal is perfect.”

She finally looked up, her eyes showing no room for negotiation.

“That’s my submission for the competition.”

“You win awards every year anyway. What’s the big deal if you let him have it just this once?” Her tone was casual, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.

“Besides, the company needs to nurture new talent.”

I stared at the woman I’d shared a bed with for five years, and suddenly, her face blurred.

“Do you know how many all-nighters I pulled for this proposal? You’re giving it to an intern who just started?”

“Alex, don’t be so petty. It’s just a proposal, isn’t it?”

Her face hardened. “I’ve already decided.”

My fists clenched, rage surged through my veins.
