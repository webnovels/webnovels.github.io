Being pregnant with the child of the amnesiac Cooper Corporation CEO, he regained his memory.

I'm not particularly beautiful and my background isn't noteworthy.

When he regained consciousness, he dismissed me with disdain: "Stop bothering me. I won't marry a nanny's daughter."

He assumed I would cling to him desperately.

Little did he know, I was unfazed and gladly accepted the 60 million in compensation.

Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, here I come!

Later, the once-invincible billionaire CEO chased me across the globe to win me back.

With reddened eyes, he awkwardly said, "The child misses you."

I pretended not to hear: "I'm sorry, I'm unmarried and childless."
