I shivered, wrapped in a vibrant, thigh-high red dress, as the night breeze whipped around me on the street opposite the bar.

I was suffering out here, all just to snag some drunk guy nobody was watching, to absorb a little life essence.

It wasn’t that I didn’t want to be like my cousin, Blair, and just dive into the bar for prey. But it was way too loud in there. Fox ears are naturally sensitive, especially for an accomplished fox spirit like me.

A tall boy stopped in front of me, almost six feet three inches. I had to crane my neck to look at him.

He was in a blue tracksuit, his eyes clear and bright, his nose and mouth delicately shaped. His skin was so smooth and flawless, he looked like he’d melt at a touch. Honestly, he looked good enough to eat.

But seeing his age, he was probably still in school. Was this too wrong?

“Are you working, Miss?”

Just hit on me, why are your eyes darting around like that? And what’s with the blush?!

Did this kid just mistake me for a streetwalker?

Another cold gust of wind made me shiver. Wrong or not, I needed that life essence. So, I went for it.

I put on my most innocent, charming face, the one I used on elders. I gently tugged his sleeve, gazing up at him, blinking my eyes.

“I’m freezing, sweetie. How about a kiss to warm me up?”

“Why should I give you a kiss?”

“Because I’m craving... ugh, I mean, I’m starving.”

The boy didn't seem to notice my slip-up. His eyes twinkled with amusement, and he took a step closer, slowly lowering his head towards me.

I widened my mouth, practically drooling, ready to suck down that sweet life essence.

My ninth tail was practically waving at me!

It wasn't until he pulled me into a convenience store and shoved a sandwich into my hand, no questions asked, that I finally snapped out of it.

Wait, this isn’t what I’m hungry for!

The scent of chicken wings wafted to my nose. I watched him pop a chicken wing into his mouth, then looked down at the whole-wheat bread in my hand.

He just stared at me, looking completely innocent.

“Why aren’t you eating, Miss? Aren’t you hungry?”

Unbelievable! He didn't even offer me a chicken wing!

I clutched my bread, turned, and stomped off, feeling incredibly wronged.

Ugh, men are the worst!
