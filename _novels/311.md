Leo, the Rake

Leo was a notorious playboy.

After we started dating, he seemed to settle down, shedding his wild ways. Everyone said he was utterly, madly in love with me.

But later, I saw him with the girl who used to bully me, laughing as he said, "Audrey? She's just a boring, utterly unappealing deaf girl. Honestly, playing with her was a total drag."

His half-brother chuckled, "You're willing to let her go? That’s great. Next time you see her, remember to call her sister-in-law."

Leo completely freaked out.
