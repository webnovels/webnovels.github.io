My wife used to travel for work once a month, and she always brought me back a little something.

On her 99th trip, she came home with a single flower from Savannah.

Since you can't check flowers as luggage, she carried it in her hands the whole time—through two connecting flights—just to bring it home.

"Spring starts early down there," Sophia murmured, "I couldn't wait for you to see it."

But a minute before she walked through the door, a text popped up from an unknown number:

"Your wife went to Savannah with her boyfriend this month."

The photo that came with it showed Sophia and Vincent kissing under those old oak trees.

As soon as she went to shower, I threw the flower in the trash. Staring at my computer screen, I dialed a number I hadn't called in three years:

"Dad, I messed up. I'm leaving Sophia."

They say marriages without family support rarely work out. That wedding three years ago? Probably a mistake. Now it was time to cut my losses.


"Babe, can you send that file to Alex for me? It's on my phone."

"Sure."

Only after I answered did Sophia turn on the shower and step in.

Her phone was on the table. Sophia never cared if I looked at her phone—she even told me to check it whenever I wanted.

I typed in my birthday and unlocked the screen.

After sending the file, my eyes drifted to Vincent's name in the messages.

The chat history was all business. Sophia was too careful to leave anything suspicious.

I clicked on Vincent's social media profile.

His most recent post was a photo of two hands clasped together under an ancient oak tree.

[She took me to Savannah, just like I always wanted.]

This post was definitely hidden from coworkers and me.

There was only one comment from a mutual friend: *Was that your beautiful mystery girl who took you?

Vincent replied: Yep.

Two weeks ago, an unknown number texted me, saying my so-called devoted wife was cheating.

Since then, I'd been getting daily proof of Sophia's affair.

Turns out her monthly business trips were actually romantic getaways with Vincent. They'd seen oceans, snow, and the northern lights—kissing and cuddling all over the world.

I had the photos authenticated; they weren't faked.

Sophia, Vincent, and I went to high school together, though I never really talked to Vincent much.

Then one day, Sophia said Vincent was applying to be her assistant. Since he was an old classmate, I told her to hire him. Never thought I'd be letting the fox into the henhouse.

Scrolling through more of Vincent's social media, he posted travel photos every month—each caption hinting at his secret lover.

[Life's best adventures are half the journey, half you.]

[Falling in love as the sun goes down.]

[Checking off bucket list destinations with my person.]

Every location matched Sophia's "business trip" cities—and lined up perfectly with those anonymous texts.

Some photos showed a woman's silhouette. Her face was blurry, but I'd recognize Sophia anywhere.

On top of that, Vincent was showing off jewelry, fancy watches, and designer stuff.

Turns out the gifts Sophia gave me? He got similar ones too.

Three years into our marriage, this perfect partner—so attentive, so admired by everyone—had really cheated on me.

Memories of Sophia and me together flashed through my mind like a movie reel. All those sweet words and hugs now felt like thorns digging into my chest.

I glanced at the project proposal next to me—I hadn't slept well in two days because of it.

Suddenly, I felt arms wrap around me from behind.

Her hands locked tightly around my waist.

Sophia nuzzled into my neck, her voice muffled:

"What are you thinking about?"

"Babe, I missed you so much while I was gone."

I didn't say anything. Just thinking about her being with someone else made me sick to my stomach.

"What's wrong? Your eyes look red."

Sophia could tell I was off. She turned me around gently, looking worried.

I shook my head, fanning my burning eyes:

"Just stressed lately. Work's been overwhelming."

Sophia knelt down, noticing the proposal by my hand. Her voice was soft and hopeful: "Once this project hits, we'll go to Iceland to see the northern lights like we planned—really unwind." She brushed her fingers over the file like it was something precious.

Then she looked up at me, eyes shining: "Our hard work's gonna pay off, right?"

Sophia... How can you plan a future with me while traveling the world holding another man's hand?

I managed a weak nod. She stood up, her thumb brushing my lips. After a second, her voice got a little rough:

"The doctor said... your stomach's been acting up lately. You need more rest."

She leaned in to kiss me, but I couldn't handle it. I spun around and ran to the bathroom, dry-heaving.

Sophia followed, panicking. She rubbed my back, worried: "Once this project settles down, we'll take a real vacation. You're pushing yourself too hard."

She thought my stomach issues were flaring up again.

She had no idea I was planning to walk away from this project we'd both poured our hearts into.
