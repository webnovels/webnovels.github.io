Ever since I became pregnant, my health hasn't been the best.
Once my mother-in-law found out, she moved into our marital home, under the guise of taking care of me, along with my younger brother-in-law's wife.
Her demeanor changed drastically from her usual kindness, and she started saying absurd things: "My son is the eldest, so he has the duty to support his younger brother and sister-in-law."
"Besides, he's a high achiever, so he should be in charge. Always listening to women won't get him anywhere."
"Declan is no longer with us, and it's Jasper's responsibility to continue the family line. Since you're pregnant and can't look after him properly, let Declan's wife do it."
My anger rose to my throat, but just then, Jasper came in and refused her.
"I've already promised Nora that she is the only one for me, no exceptions."
Seeing my husband stand firmly by my side, I felt reassured that I had chosen the right partner.
I gritted my teeth, working overtime to save for baby supplies, while drinking the special nourishing soup Jasper made for me.
However, I discovered that the soup was drugged, and my husband was having an affair with his sister-in-law right under my nose.
