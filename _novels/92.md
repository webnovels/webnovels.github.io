When my girlfriend was at her lowest, I broke up with her.

Years later, after she found success and fame, she used every means possible to marry me.

Everyone said I was her one true love, her most treasured husband.

But in reality, every night she brought a different man home, shattering my heart and turning me into a laughingstock.

I never fought back. I never cried or argued. I simply moved into the study, quietly staying out of her way.

She hated that. One night, furious, she kissed me roughly and whispered, "Aren't you jealous?"

What she didn't know was that I was sick.

While she spent each day trying to hurt me, I was silently counting down how many days I had left to live.
