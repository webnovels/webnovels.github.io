My Vengeance, His Redemption

I woke up in a shifter romance novel. Not as the heroine, but as the sickly, wicked villainess, married off to the Lion King himself, a brute known for his violent rages.

The System told me: Bear him an heir. Use my super-fertile body to stabilize his royal bloodline, and I'd live. Simple as that.

And he did. He grew gentler by the day. He'd awkwardly try to soothe my morning sickness, fiercely fend off all the scheming rivals who eyed his throne, and even cast aside the original heroine for me.

I genuinely believed I'd softened his heart with love, bending the story to my will.

But he had no idea. The very day I gave birth, the System's cold, metallic voice echoed in my mind: [Congratulations, Host! Breeding mission complete. Energy full. Initiating sacrifice protocol. Your flesh and blood will reconstruct Queen Lyra's body.]

It hit me then. All his tenderness, all his supposed love… it was all a ploy. He needed me to willingly become a human sacrifice for his true love, Lyra – his 'White Moonlight.'

On the brink of death, I gathered my last ounce of strength and forged a symbiotic pact with my newborn, divine bloodline cub.

“My darling husband, you want my life for her rebirth? Why don't you ask your own son if he agrees first!”
