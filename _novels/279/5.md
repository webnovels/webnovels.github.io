Over the next few days, I quietly began gathering evidence to prove that those creative proposals were indeed my original work.

I dug out all the creative drafts, organized the evolution of the design concepts.

I even found testimony from some clients, proving that they initially chose to work with Phoenix Creative because of my ideas.

At the same time, I was secretly contacting some excellent creative talents, preparing to establish my own studio.

During this period, Caleb seemed to sense something and started badmouthing me frequently to Sarah.

He told Sarah that my work attitude had been very negative recently, and that I had been hostile towards him, affecting his work enthusiasm.

Sarah actually believed him and even specifically called me in to talk, saying my recent performance had disappointed her.

“Alex, Caleb said you’ve been quite unfriendly to him lately. That’s really bad for the company’s team atmosphere.”

I sat opposite her, calmly looking at her.

“What else did he say?”

“He said you deliberately assigned him unreasonable tasks and even disparaged his abilities in front of other colleagues.”

I couldn’t help but laugh. This Caleb really knew how to twist facts.

“And you believe him?”

Sarah avoided my gaze, a hint of guilt in her eyes.

“I just hope you two can get along. After all, you’re colleagues in the same company.”

“Alright, I understand.”

I stood up to leave, but Sarah called out to me.

“Alex, are you upset with me recently?”

I turned back to look at her, a bitter pang in my heart.

“No, I’m fine.”

“That’s good. I thought you were mad at me.”

I didn't say anything more and left her office directly.

That same afternoon, I received the first draft of the divorce agreement from Marcus.

I read it carefully, confirmed there were no issues, and decided to confront her that night.

When I got home, Sarah was busy in the kitchen, seemingly in a good mood.

“Why are you home so early today?”

“There’s something I want to talk to you about.”

She walked out of the kitchen, carrying the freshly cooked dishes, a smile still on her face.

“What’s so mysterious?”

I took the divorce agreement from my briefcase and placed it on the dining table.

Sarah’s plate almost slipped from her hands when she saw the cover of the agreement.

“What does this mean?”

Her voice trembled, her face instantly turning pale.

“I don’t think there’s any need for us to continue.”

“Let’s get a divorce.”

“Because of Caleb, you want to divorce me?”

I shook my head.

“It’s not because of Caleb. It’s because of your distrust and disrespect towards me.”

“Where did I disrespect you?”
