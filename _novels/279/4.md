The next day, I found that several important creative files on my computer had been deleted, and even the recycle bin had been emptied.

These files were proposals I had recently prepared for several major clients, each one costing me a great deal of effort.

Even worse, one of them was my entry for the Global Advertising Festival, an award that held significant meaning for me.

I immediately contacted the IT department and asked them to help me recover the data.

The technicians checked and told me that these files were deliberately deleted, and the deletion time was around eleven last night.

At eleven last night, I was already home. Only the security guards and employees working overtime were at the company.

I reviewed the surveillance footage and found that Caleb had indeed stayed at the company very late last night, and he had also entered my office.

When I told Sarah about this discovery, her reaction utterly disappointed me.

“Maybe he wanted to learn your creative process and accidentally deleted them. Don’t maliciously speculate about a kid.”

“Accidentally deleted? Sarah, even the recycle bin was emptied. Is that an accidental deletion?”

“Maybe he was trying to help you clear junk files.”

I looked at her defending Caleb, and suddenly, this woman in front of me felt so foreign.

“Fine, even if it was an accidental deletion, why didn’t he tell me? Why did he hide it?”

“He was probably afraid you’d blame him.”

I took a deep breath, trying to control my emotions.

“Sarah, I’ll ask you one last time. If it has to be one of us, me or Caleb, who would you choose?”

She froze, clearly not expecting such a question.

After a long pause, she finally spoke, her voice trembling slightly.

“Why are you forcing me to choose? You’re both important to me.”

“Answer me!”

A flicker of something crossed her eyes, but she finally gritted her teeth and said it.

“I won’t fire Caleb. He’s a young man with potential. His future shouldn’t be ruined because of some misunderstanding.”

Those words were like a dagger plunged into my heart.

I understood then. In her heart, I held less importance than an intern she’d known for less than a month.

“Alright, I understand.”

I turned and left her office, having made up my mind.

That same evening, I contacted my lawyer friend, Marcus.

“Marcus, help me draft a divorce agreement.”

There was a few seconds of silence on the other end of the line.

“Alex, are you serious? You and Sarah were always so good together.”

“Just prepare it. I want to see the agreement within three days.”

“Okay, but you need to think carefully. There’s the issue of company shares between you two.”

“I know. I’ll give up all my shares in her company, but I have one condition.”

“What condition?”

“I want to reclaim the copyrights for all my original works, as well as the copyrights for all the creative proposals I’ve designed for the company over the past five years.”

Marcus gasped.

“Alex, those are the core assets of her company!”

“They were always my work. I’m just taking back what belongs to me.”
