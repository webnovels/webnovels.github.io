On the day of the graduation ceremony, I mustered up the courage to confess my feelings to my long-time crush.
But I accidentally got hit by a car.
When I woke up, my crush was standing in front of me, looking at me with a cold expression.
"You're awake? Perfect timing. Let's discuss the divorce agreement."
Me: ???
I haven't even confessed yet, how did we end up talking about divorce?

0On the day of my college commencement ceremony, I finally mustered up the courage to confess my feelings to Aria, my long-time crush. Across the street, Aria was taking photos in her beautiful graduation gown. Excited, I ran towards her, not noticing the red light at the crosswalk.

A loud "BANG!" echoed, and I was struck by a car. Everything went black.

When I opened my eyes again, I found myself staring at a stark white ceiling. To my surprise, Aria was standing by my bedside. She was as beautiful as ever, and this was probably the closest we'd ever been.

Aria stood there, her gaze shifting from the IV drip to my face. As I looked at her, I noticed a ring on her left ring finger. My heart sank. Had the girl I'd loved for so long already found someone else?

Swallowing my disappointment, I forced a smile and greeted her, "What are you doing here?"

As I tried to sit up, I realized my arm was wrapped in thick bandages.

Aria sat down on the chair beside my bed, her voice cold and distant. "Mr. Liam, you really know how to make a scene. Risking your life for a divorce? That's a bit much, don't you think?"

I stared at her, completely bewildered. Divorce? I hadn't even graduated yet, let alone gotten married. Where did this talk of divorce come from?

Just then, a nurse entered the room, carrying a tray of bandages.

"Dr. Aria, you're still here? Sir, you're so lucky. When you had the accident, Dr. Aria happened to be passing by and gave you emergency treatment. Otherwise, you'd be dealing with more than just a broken arm."

The nurse carefully cleaned my wound as she spoke. As she gently placed my hand down, I noticed something shocking – there was a ring on my right ring finger too! And it clearly matched Aria's ring.

Panic and confusion flooded my mind. After the nurse left, I grabbed Aria's sleeve.

"Your name is Aria, right?"

Aria frowned, looking annoyed. She jerked her sleeve away from my grasp and stared at me coldly.

"Since you're awake, let's discuss the divorce agreement."
