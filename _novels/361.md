After I died, my parents signed the organ donation consent form, transplanting my retinas into their most cherished adopted daughter, Felicity.
Without me, they finally became a real family.
My whole life, I'd fought with Felicity, only to end up with nothing but a bleak, desolate fate.
Reborn, I decided to live my own life, and unexpectedly, I found a happy ending.
