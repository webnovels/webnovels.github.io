"The first night of our marriage, Brad carved the word ""Slave"" into my skin.

He said I belonged to him, and no one else was allowed to touch me.

Then one day, I saw an identical rose tattoo on his sister, Brittany's, chest.

Curious, I reached out and touched it, asking her what it was about.

She panicked, pulling her shirt up, and looked at me with tears in her eyes. ""My brother did this for me, with his own hand. Don't you dare ruin it!""

Brad just stood there, silent.

The next day, I found myself up for auction online: ""Pure Female Slave – Starting Bid $1!"""
