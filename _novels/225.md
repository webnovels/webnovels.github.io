I was in the third year of my arranged marriage when my parents found my twin brother, who was kidnapped at the age of five. 

He was also my wife's first love. She rekindled her old feelings for him and even had his child.

 My parents wanted me to claim the child as my own.

 I decided to leave everything behind. My family regretted it later. 

But I will never return to that home.
