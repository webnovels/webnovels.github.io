When the man came to pick me up, I lay naked on the bar table.

He saw the wine stains and scars on my body, yet his eyes showed no pity.

I picked up my torn clothes from the floor and numbly followed him.

I took my sister's place to marry Gideon, trying to please him for five years.

During the worst of my depression, he brought home the woman he was seeing.

He forced me to confess and serve a girl who looked exactly like my sister.

The tenth time I cut my wrist, Gideon sat by the bed and told me he hated me.

"Vera, don't use such means to get my attention. Seeing you only makes me hate you more... If only it hadn't been you who survived back then..."

A sharp pain pierced my heart, and once again I asked for a divorce. But Gideon still wouldn’t let me go. Until a fire, reminiscent of the past, trapped both Nora and me.

Before the pillar of fire collapsed, I exchanged my life for Nora’s escape.

Everyone blamed me for my sister's death. This time, I paid with my life. But Gideon went mad.
