"He was obsessed with her. Like, pathetically obsessed.

My husband, the CEO, was drooling over the new intern, Tiffany, and to impress her, he handed over the formula I'd slaved over for three years – just so she could rush it to market first.

Seriously?

I went to him, ready to rip him a new one, and caught him and Tiffany in a seriously compromising position right there in his office.

I tried to stay calm, my voice shaking as I begged him to pull the drug. ""It's not finished, Liam! It'll kill people!""

Tiffany, hanging off his arm like a cheap accessory, just smirked.

""Oh, honey, I practically finished it myself. What could possibly go wrong? Liam, is she just jealous that I'm getting the spotlight?"" She purred, ""Should I give the project back to her, sugar?""

Liam exploded, turning on me like I was the enemy. He ordered me out of the company. Like, now.

The next day, six patients dropped dead at the launch event. Panic set in fast. Liam and Tiffany, those two-faced snakes, immediately pointed the finger at me. I was the one who had screwed up the formula, they claimed.

The enraged families attacked me, beating me to death. They cremated my body that night and dumped my ashes in a landfill. I died full of hate.

Then, I woke up. Back in Liam's office, the day he told me about the intern.

This time, I'm not going down without a fight.

This time, I'm divorcing him. "
