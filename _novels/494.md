Julian Hayes dragged me into a compromising situation, busting me with his rival.

A barrage of cameras and microphones were shoved into my face, completely ignoring my half-naked body.

Julian spoke with a smug, confident tone, "So, Mr. Vance, are you so desperate for women that you'd dare to sleep with my wife?"

"Wife, come here."

But I just laid out my divorce certificate and marriage certificate, linking my arm with Caleb Vance's.

"Excuse me, but we're legally married."

"Julian, did you forget? We got divorced. You were the one who asked for it."

"You wanted me to orchestrate a fake divorce, using my reputation to set up Caleb?"

Seriously? I *just* got remarried, thank you very much!

Go back to him? Dream on!
