I turned to leave; I shouldn’t have come to this event in the first place.

Before I could step out the door, Skylar’s voice stopped me.

“Wait, Owen. Sign this share transfer agreement before you go.”

Skylar rushed towards me, holding a contract and a pen.

Devin followed closely, as if afraid I might escape.

I picked up the pen and signed my name on the contract without even glancing at it.

As surprise flashed across their faces, I asked, “Can I go now?”

Devin looked at the contract, his excitement barely contained, and nodded at Skylar.

They seemed shocked by how easily I’d agreed. The process was far simpler than they’d imagined.

After I left, the sound of joyous laughter erupted from the private room once more.

“Congratulations, Devin Shaw, on your promotion to Vice President!”

A cold smirk played on my lips as I walked away. Devin, your tenure as Vice President will be the shortest in history.

Because you won’t last more than three days.

While they were celebrating in the private room, I returned to the office and meticulously organized all my client lists, preparing for what was to come.

Before I knew it, night had fallen.

When I arrived home with my laptop, Skylar was already back.

But there was also another unwelcome guest in the house.

Devin was busily preparing a hangover remedy for Skylar in the kitchen.

He didn't show an ounce of panic when he saw me, remaining perfectly composed.

It was as if this was his own home.

He was wearing my house slippers, and I was standing barefoot on the cold floor.

The chill crept up from my feet, reaching deep into my heart.

Skylar, sprawled on the sofa, was completely drunk, slurring,

“Devin, let’s keep drinking. We won’t stop until we’re wasted!”

“To your promotion to Vice President!”

Devin then solicitously brought a bowl of the hangover remedy to Skylar.

They treated me as if I didn't exist, as if I were thin air.

Devin intimately helped Skylar up from the sofa and carefully placed a cushion behind her.

His actions were so practiced, so tender, it was as if he were Skylar’s legitimate boyfriend.

After feeding Skylar the remedy, Devin finally seemed to notice me. He approached, a cold sneer on his face.

“Owen, Ms. Thorne just wouldn’t let me leave. She insisted I escort her home. What could I do?”

At this point, calling Devin manipulative wouldn’t be an exaggeration.

His petty triumph was sickeningly evident.

Before, every time he came to our house under the pretense of delivering documents, I’d get jealous and angry, even having huge fights with Skylar.

But now, I felt absolutely nothing.

He tried to provoke me, searching for an outburst or a flicker of jealousy on my face.

But I didn’t give him the satisfaction this time. I simply turned and walked towards my study, laptop in hand.

I closed the study door, shutting them out.

I thought Devin would leave after Skylar finished her hangover remedy.

But to my shock, he was bold enough to stay the night.
