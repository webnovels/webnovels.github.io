Late at night, as I was organizing files in my study, I heard some utterly sickening sounds from the living room.

At first, I thought it was Skylar, throwing up from being drunk.

But the moment I opened my study door, I witnessed the full extent of their shamelessness.

Two naked figures, illuminated by the moonlight, were intertwined on the sofa.

My blood ran cold, freezing in my veins.

My clenched fists dug my nails deep into my palms.

Staring at the two of them in the living room, a surge of rage coursed through me, with nowhere to go.

Skylar, emboldened by the alcohol, mockingly taunted me, shamelessly trampling my dignity as a man.

“Devin, it’s great to be young! So many tricks, unlike Owen. He’s so rigid, only knows one position.”

Devin’s voice dropped, a playful whine.

“So, who’s better? Me, or that old stick-in-the-mud?”

Skylar hooked her arm around Devin’s neck, laughing sensuously.

“What do you even need to ask? Of course, you’re better.”

Their entangled forms moved from the sofa to the floor.

Lurid sounds filled the air.

They seemed to have completely forgotten I was still in the study. Their audacity was astounding.

I forced myself to suppress my rage and dialed the police. I would ruin them completely.

As the living room lights flickered on, their naked bodies were exposed from the darkness.

In their panic, Skylar grabbed a throw pillow from the sofa, trying to cover herself, her face contorted with terror as she stared at me.

“Owen, what are you doing here?”

I spoke coldly, “This is my home. Why shouldn’t I be here?”

Devin quickly pulled on his boxers, then walked towards me, a sneer on his face.

“Ms. Thorne, don’t be afraid of him. He’s just a lowly team leader now anyway.”

“You’re the CEO of this company. And with my ten percent shares, we run this company, not him.”

Skylar, who had been panicking, suddenly regained her composure after hearing Devin’s words.

She picked up her clothes, dressed, and then glared at me.

“That’s right, Owen. I run this company now. Get out, immediately!”

For three years, through thick and thin, I had poured my heart and soul into this company. All my efforts, all my contributions, were dismissed with a single, dismissive sentence from Skylar.

I pulled out the resignation letter I’d prepared earlier and tossed it onto the floor.

“Perfect. I’ve wanted to resign for a long time.”

Devin picked up the letter, confirming its contents with a glance.

Then he laughed. “Owen, since you’re voluntarily resigning, all the shares under your name will now belong to us.”

“You’re such a fool, handing over the company like this!”

With that, Devin mocked me to my face, his laughter sharp and cruel.

The moment I caught them in their betrayal, my heart had completely withered.

Skylar, I ask you, honestly, in these past three years, from building this company from scratch to achieving some success, when did I not help you overcome every company crisis?

When did I not provide the connections and background for every major deal?

Even that time the company faced a financial crisis, it was my father’s assets that served as collateral for the bank loan.

And you, for a male assistant, fired me and told me to get lost.

You didn’t hesitate to become my enemy.

Not only did you negate three years of my effort and dedication, but you also shattered three years of my genuine love for you.

I wanted to see how this company would function without me.

I sneered at Skylar: “You want the company’s shares? That’s a pipe dream. I’ll make sure you walk away penniless.”

Just then, a frantic knock echoed from the door. The moment it opened, two police officers rushed in.

“We received a report of suspected solicitation here.”


The moment the police burst through the door, Devin was wearing only his boxers, his upper body bare.

Skylar’s dress barely covered her private parts.
