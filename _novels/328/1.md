After he left, he never came to see me again. Looking at the empty hospital room, I felt a pang in my heart.
The nurse told me I had to get up and walk around today.
Walking would be good, it might help clear my mind.
I leaned against the wall, slowly inching forward with my head down, not knowing why my legs felt like they weighed a ton.
Suddenly, another pair of feet appeared in front of me.
Those shoes... they belonged to Chloe.
Just as I looked up, she grabbed my throat, her face contorted with rage:
"Ava, you've stolen Lucas from me for so many years. It's time you paid the price!"
I desperately tried to pry her hands off, attempting to make her let go.
But she only tightened her grip. My face turned red from the lack of air.
"Lucas showed me your photo. You freak, how dare you stand by his side.
"You got lucky last time, but this time I'll make it look like a medical accident."
Lucas had actually taken secret photos of me and showed them to others.
I managed to squeeze out a few words from my throat, "But you're still... by his side..."
At this moment, she was like a madwoman, deaf to anything I said, her eyes filled with hatred.
Suddenly, a familiar voice came: "Chloe, where are you?"
Looking to the side, I saw Lucas anxiously searching for her.
Chloe immediately let go of me, straightened her clothes, and quickly returned to her room, acting as if nothing had happened.
It turned out Chloe had been staying in the room next to mine all along. Lucas hadn't gone to work at the company; he had been taking care of her.
I collapsed on the floor, gasping for air.
At this moment, Chloe deliberately raised her voice.
"Lucas, do you really want her to give me her heart?"
"Of course. When I saw her disgusting side, my heart was already dead. But at least she still has some use.
"I'm sorry I can't give you an official status yet."
I let out a bitter laugh and struggled to get up from the floor, feeling dizzy.
Suddenly, the wall beside me cracked with a loud noise, and pieces of the ceiling began to fall.
People were thrown into a panic, with someone shouting: "Run! The hospital is collapsing!"
I snapped to attention and started running, but after just a few steps, I felt an intense pain in my head, as if my brain was rattling inside.
I clutched my head, my eyes red and unfocused as I stood rooted to the spot.
If I don't run, I'll die.
Mustering up my courage, I was about to move forward when I felt a sharp pain in my shoulder.
The force of the impact threw me off balance, and I fell to the ground uncontrollably.
The dust in front of me was getting thicker. I waved my hand in front of my face to clear my vision and saw who had bumped into me.
It was Lucas, carrying Chloe on his back as he ran desperately towards the exit.
The patients around me who could run had already fled, and those who couldn't were being helped by their family members. Behind me, there was no one.
The only person who used to be behind me was now carrying another woman away.
I could no longer hold back and burst into loud sobs.
