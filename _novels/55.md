Five years ago, on Mother's Day, my son gave me the most unforgettable gift of my life—a debt of five million. As a designer, I worked tirelessly by day and took on part-time jobs at night. Eventually, I managed to gather the money and returned it to the creditor, feeling utterly exhausted. But then I saw my son Jasper and my ex-husband Griffin, looking sharp in suits, sitting comfortably in a private room while the creditor was humbly toasting them and offering smiles. The father and son projected an air of authority.

"Mr. Carter, I really tried my best. Who would have thought your wife would be so stubborn, working herself to the bone rather than asking you for help?" Jasper reassured his father, "Dad, don't worry. If I incur another debt of twenty million, this time there's no way Mom can escape!"

Griffin put down his cigar, stood up, and patted his son on the shoulder. "Dad, I've got my eye on a sports car. Look." "Go to the finance department tomorrow and get the money. It's just a car. Remember, Jasper, you're the heir to the Carter Corporation." The Carter Corporation has been making waves in the business world, dominating all industries in City A for the past decade. Even the fashion company I work for is a subsidiary of Carter Corporation. When my son graduated from college, he envied others, wondering why he didn't have such wealth despite having the same last name. "My son is so outstanding; he'll definitely reach the top of the pyramid in the future." He smiled and nodded. Perhaps even then, Jasper had already reconnected with Griffin.

The noise in the club was deafening, and I felt a cold sweat break out, a sense of bitterness welling up inside me. But what came next plunged me into despair. "It's all my mom's fault. You just had a few affairs outside—did she really need to divorce you and ruin my good life?" "My mom is so unreasonable. If it weren't for your social engagements back then, there wouldn't be a business empire now. Women are just petty."

I'll never forget the day I discovered Griffin's affair, catching him in bed with another woman at a hotel. He never paid a dime in child support after our divorce, and I raised our son through hardship. Back then, he was understanding, knowing how hard I worked and wanting to help share the burden. He started his own business right after college. But then, on Mother's Day, he told me his business failed, and his partner ran off, leaving him in debt. I watched as the creditors came to our door, vandalizing and threatening to harm Jasper if he didn't repay the money. I stood resolutely in front of my son, taking on the debt myself.

As a seasoned designer, I shouldn't have had to work so hard on designs anymore, but the debt was enormous. I had no choice but to take on freelance work in secret. Unfortunately, the company found out, and because I violated industry rules, my bosses, out of respect for my years of service, demoted me to a design assistant. With even less money, I had to work during the day, wait tables at a hot pot restaurant at night, and clean at a fast-food restaurant until the early hours. I lived like this for five years, but the debt just snowballed, getting bigger and bigger.

Jasper disappeared, leaving me with no choice but to beg the creditors for a few more days. But they were unmoved; debts had to be repaid. I had no right to ask for leniency. Yet, thinking of my son's future, I knelt and banged my head on the ground until it bled. The debt collectors were afraid of causing a death and agreed to let me pay in installments. I'm not someone who gives up easily. For my son, I became stronger, perhaps the power of a mother's love. But what I didn't expect was that this was all a scam. I lost completely in love and money.

Disappointment overwhelmed me, and I called an old friend. "Imogen, you once said you hoped I'd become the head of your company's design department. Do you still need me?" There was silence on the other end. Just as I was about to speak, Imogen burst into tears of joy. "Hurry and come over. With your talent, you can easily be the design director or even the general manager." "Back then, you gave up your career for marriage and children, and after the divorce, you returned to the design industry, all for that kid." "You even turned down an offer from Milan's renowned design college." "We’re preparing for a big show at the end of the year, and the design team is working in isolation. Think about it."

I raised my trembling right hand, looking at my rundown self in the mirror. "I don't need to think about it, but my age..." "Don't worry about that. Your design concepts and abilities are well recognized." "The clothes you designed back in the day are still classics for C Brand. Once you settle things in City A, I'll send someone to pick you up next Monday."

I hung up and decided to settle things with them. I opened the private room door, and Jasper froze, then quickly walked over to my side. "Mom, you're here. You. Why did you come so late? I almost got beaten to death." The creditor stood up and slapped Jasper. "Have you prepared the money? We agreed on the deadline today. If you don't have enough, I'll cut off one of your son's fingers." Griffin squinted at me. "Cora, is this how you educate your son? Or you could beg me, return to my side, and I'll find a way to help you out." "After all, you wouldn't want to see your son's future ruined, right?" "If you really don't want to beg me, I have a quick-money job for you." "You've kept yourself well all these years. I know a place that loves women like you. How about it?"

The men in the room burst into laughter, and Jasper was deeply ashamed. "Mom, did you bring enough money? If so, hand it over." "What do you mean, watching me get my fingers cut off?" I trembled all over, not wanting to argue with them. I produced a bank card from my pocket. "This is one million. Starting today, we owe nothing." I was about to leave. "Hold on, who said one million was enough?" "Lady, your son borrowed a million. We're not a charity; there has to be some interest." The creditor gripped my hand tightly, and out of the corner of my eye, I saw Griffin's gaze. He instantly let go of my hand.

"Mom, I didn't tell you, but they... They want interest too. If I don't pay, they'll break my legs." "Mom, I'm your only son. You can't just watch me die, right?" Jasper knelt on the ground, pleading. "Mom, you have to help me. You have to." "Why don't you beg Dad? Apologize to him, and the three of us can live happily together. Wouldn't that be nice?" "Why must you insist on suffering so much? Kneel and apologize to Dad. If you do, he'll forgive you."

Griffin sneered. "Your mom is a college graduate and a famous designer. I'm just a nouveau riche; I can't handle it." The creditor picked up a wine bottle from the table, ready to smash it against Jasper's leg. They were all acting out a charade for me. My son, my son, would let his own mother suffer such humiliation for money. Where did the boy who brought me foot baths, massaged my shoulders, and promised to make lots of money to support me go?

Griffin and I were in love once. In those days, I got pregnant with Jasper out of wedlock, and we later married. I had severe morning sickness, and Griffin canceled his business trips, even losing some big deals to stay by my side. Those were truly hard times. I had a falling out with my family, and the childbirth expenses were cobbled together. Griffin worked three jobs a day to ensure I had proper nutrition.

Later, when he cheated, we divorced. When I make a choice, I never look back. I raised our child alone. Being a single mom was never easy. I struggled to raise him. Later, with my illness and his college expenses, we couldn't afford his private university tuition. Griffin appeared during this time, flaunting his success. I knew he made some money and that his reappearance was to force me to return. Even my son sided with him because I had no money. During our arguments, he belittled me to nothing.

I thought about having a serious talk with my son, inviting him out for a meal. But Griffin's words made him kick me out of the car. That day, it was pouring rain, drenching me as my heart ached. Years of nurturing and love couldn't compare to Griffin's money. When I returned home, my son saw my sorry state and only said, "Mom, after all these years apart from Dad, we can eat together anytime. You don't mind, do you?" "Of course not."

I knew he was under a lot of pressure about his future. If Griffin had the means, I wouldn't stop him. After all, he was Jasper's biological father. I had no reason to stop their meetings. Perhaps because I gave way, it awakened Jasper's love for me. He was obedient and filial for a while. On Mother's Day, he promised me a surprise. Who knew it would be a million-dollar debt? I can't forget Jasper kneeling in front of me, tearfully repenting. It seems to echo with the current scene.

"Mom, I'm begging you. Please ask Dad for help. He surely has a way to get us through this." "You're not young anymore. Physical labor won't earn you much. Wouldn't it be great for the three of us to live happily together?"

---

Perhaps my stepping back reignited Jasper's affection for me, because for a while afterward, he was both obedient and respectful.

On Mother's Day, he mentioned he had a surprise for me. Little did I know it would be the burden of a million-dollar debt.

I can never forget Jasper kneeling before me, tears streaming down his face as he expressed his remorse.

It all seems to blur with the scene unfolding now.

"Mom, I'm begging you, please talk to Dad. He must have a solution. He'll help us get through this tough time."

"You're already an adult. You can't earn much through manual labor. Can't we just live peacefully as a family of three?"

This wasn't the life I envisioned for myself. Step by step, father and son drove me into despair, pretending as if they were forcing me to reconsider.

I couldn't bear it any longer.

"Jasper, he's your father. It's his responsibility to support you financially. Don't pressure me to come up with a solution!"

I pushed him away and turned to leave. On my way home, tears fell despite myself.

For eighteen years, I've raised Jasper with great effort. The reflection in the mirror shows a face weathered by time, and even my hands have grown rough.

To save money, I live in a rental apartment that's cold in winter and hot in summer. To earn more to repay our debts, my hands are covered with chilblains in winter, and in summer, heat rashes spread all over.

My son always uses schoolwork as an excuse to stay away year-round.

Looking back, what busy work was there? Why would Mr. Carter Jr. live in a place like this with me? The thought is almost laughable now.

A neighbor saw me and remarked with a smile, "Hasn't your Jasper come back yet? You raised him so well—he's achieved so much at such a young age. I saw him in that downtown office building a few days ago, looking so impressive."

I could only manage a bitter smile before opening the door. Everyone knows Jasper's career success is largely due to the backing of Carter Corporation. It seems I'm the only fool here.

As I looked around our home, I began to gather my things, but there wasn't much to pack.

Just then, Jasper entered, covering his nose as if there was an unpleasant odor.

"Mom, what are you doing? Where are you planning to go?"

"Surely you wouldn't just let your own son die, right? Mom, if you couldn't support me, why fight for custody? What does this mean now?"

"I'm your real son. Are you trying to evade responsibility? Are you planning to run away?"

I sat on the couch, regarding him with a cold stare.

"Mr. Carter Jr., how long will you keep pretending in front of your own mother?"

"Mom. You knew all along?"

I'm sorry, it looks like the text you want translated is not available. Could you please provide the Chinese text you're referring to?

Jasper's frantic state took me back to when he was just a child, making his first mistake, fearing my anger.

Instead of saying I raised Jasper, it's more fitting to say he was my steadfast companion during my toughest times. Many of my design inspirations were sparked by him. I did indulge him, but I tried not to spoil him.

Children from single-parent families tend to be more sensitive. I was always concerned about his emotional well-being and did my utmost to support him. He was diligent in his studies, never once causing me to worry.

When he went to college and started dating, I reminded him that while college romances are beautiful, as a man, he should be responsible towards his partner. Every Mother's Day, Jasper would gift me something small—rings, necklaces, or earrings. They were always silver but held his sincere intentions.

"Mom, don't worry. When I make big money, I'll get you fine jewelry, a big house, and a luxury car."

I smiled at him warmly.

"People say a man forgets his mother after marriage. I don't care if you earn a fortune. I just want you to be safe."

"Mom, rest assured. You'll always be number one in my heart."

"Alright, I'll wait for my son to succeed and treat me well, so I can enjoy life along with you."

Memories of a loving mother and son flashed before me. But now, Jasper's eyes seemed to burn with anger. He snatched everything from my hands and threw it to the floor.

At that moment, Griffin entered from outside.

"Dad, Mom... she's found out everything."

Griffin brushed the dust off his shoulder.

"So what if she knows? No one can stop what I, Griffin, decide to do."

He gripped my hand harshly, staring at me with menace.

"Trying to run away like last time?"

I didn't respond, just resisted with all my might, but he tossed me onto the sofa with disdain.

"We haven't seen each other in years. I do miss you a bit. I don't mind your age, so what are you unhappy about?"

I gathered all my strength and slapped Griffin across the face.

"You're shameless, Griffin, utterly shameless."

"There are plenty of women waiting for me. Don't be ungrateful!"

"Get lost. Don't come looking for me, go find whoever you want."

Just as I was about to break free, Jasper held me tightly.

"Mom, don't blame me. Don't blame me. This is what you owe me."

I looked at Griffin and Jasper with despair, blood dripping from my mouth. What did I owe him?

"Alright, Jasper, this place is beneath us. Leave everything to Dad. Don't worry; I won't break my promise!"

I slumped to the floor, watching them close the door. The sudden silence pounded in my chest.

Jasper didn't even glance back, leaving only a single sentence.

"Mom, think about me more. Do you know how long I've wanted a complete family?"

A complete family. It turned out, he always blamed me for not providing one. But he knew what Griffin had done to me.

Just then, the door was kicked open, and a group of tattooed men stormed in.

They looked at me with hostility.

"So you refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit, huh? Mr. Carter told us to teach you a lesson."

I trembled with fear, unsure of their intentions. I grabbed a fruit knife from the coffee table, waving it frantically, then quickly called Jasper. The call was repeatedly disconnected but finally connected.
