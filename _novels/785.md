Everyone in Northon knew the notorious playboy, Stephen Cooper. Whenever his name came up, they automatically thought of a love story. 

He once spent millions to get rid of his romantic partners, just so he could pursue the gorgeous obstetrician, Luciana Dean, for two years.

While she was in surgery, he would wait outside the ward with 9,999 roses. When he learned she loved films, he personally invested in a screenplay, one inspired by and written for her.

Even after knowing she was infertile, he promised to cherish her and swore his loyalty to her for life.

Now, standing in Luciana's consultation room was her best friend of ten years, Josephine Reed. Her belly was slightly protruding, her hand clutching a pregnancy report.

Blood surfaces in Luciana's palm, cut open by her trembling nails.

Stephen's mother, Liz Stone, stood behind Josephine with a rare smile. "You're really the chosen one, aren't you? I've gathered ten women, yet you're the only one who got pregnant."

Luciana's face paled, her legs nearly giving out beneath her. Stephen had never shared any of this with her.

"If Stephen hadn't threatened to cut ties with us, I would've never allowed a barren woman like you to marry into our family," Liz hissed, rolling her eyes.

That very afternoon, she moved Josephine straight into the Cooper residence.

Luciana walked into the villa in a daze, only to find Stephen waiting anxiously. 

"You scared me half to death, Lucy!" he exclaimed. "I was so close to sending all my security guards to find you!"

Her screen lit up, displaying more than 99 missed calls from him. 

"You're mad at me, aren't you?"

His lips curved into a familiar smile, and his eyes brimmed with affection as he stared at her. With a snap of his fingers, ten housemaids stepped forward in a neat line.

"These are diamonds and jewels I brought back for you from North Avalon. And just a few days ago, I named a new asteroid after you and our wedding date. Lucy, I want to give you the entire universe," he said.

Luciana stayed silent, not uttering a word. All she wanted to understand was why Stephen had broken their promise never to have children. Most importantly, why her friend, of all people?

Stephen's body stiffened slightly, his tone softening. "You two are best friends. I thought it'd make it easier for you to accept her. The Cooper family can't be without an heir. Once the baby is born, I'll send her away. You're the one I love the most, Lucy."

Luciana looked up, meeting his eyes. There were countless ways to have a child, even through IVF. Did they really have to do it the traditional way?

In the distance, Josephine approached hesitantly. "Lucy, I'm sorry. I only wanted to share your burden. I never thought you'd hate me for it…"

As she spoke, she pulled out two wishing charms that they had once hung together. Luciana's handwriting on it remained clear. "I hope Stephen and I can one day have a child of our own."

"Get out!" Luciana screamed, grabbing the wishing charm and smashing it to pieces.

Her whole body trembled with fury. Heartbroken, Stephen quickly pulled her into his arms, letting her punch and kick at him until she ran out of strength.

"Don't provoke her again," he said coldly to Josephine. "Know your place."

Josephine bit her lip. As much as she was reluctant to leave, she eventually succumbed to his dark, warning gaze. The room fell silent after a long while.

With red-rimmed eyes, Luciana shoved him away. "So… You two actually did it?"

Stephen looked uneasy. Afraid she might shut him out completely, he tried to calm her down. "Lucy, you can't have kids, so I don't expect you to understand how these things work."

Her clenched fists loosened, and she let out a bitter laugh. According to his logic, a licensed obstetrician had no idea how pregnancy worked.

He kept talking on his own, as if planning a happy future, completely ignoring the humiliation written on her face.

"Lucy, once the baby's born, you'll be the mother. Besides, you're a doctor, so you'll know how to take care of Josephine throughout her pregnancy. That sounds like a perfect plan, doesn't it?"

Luciana stared at Stephen in disbelief, never imagining she would be expected to care for the woman he got pregnant and serve her until she gave birth.

"And if I refuse?"

Stephen's gaze darkened immediately, the warmth in them slowly fading. "Don't be childish, Lucy. Families like ours need an heir. You should've known that when you married me. Otherwise…"

He paused, then added, "I'm afraid the hospital might not have a place for you anymore."

Reality hit Luciana then. Everything she had worked half her life to earn—her name, reputation, achievement—meant nothing in the world of power and privilege. It could all be erased with one word.

Stephen's breathing grew uneven. He tugged at his tie and leaned down, brushing his lips against hers. "Be good. Between you and her, I'd still choose you over and over again. She's just… a means to an end."

Luciana frowned, anger rising in her throat. Before she could refute him, Liz swept in with a team of specialists, fussing over Josephine and her check-up like she was royalty.

Their conversation was put on hold.

Luciana couldn't stand the sight of Josephine's bashful, glowing smile. She turned on her heel and went upstairs.

She stopped when she reached the study, where Stephen stood before the floor-to-ceiling window. He leaned against the window frame, legs casually crossed, a cigarette glowing between his fingers.

One of his friends frowned, somewhat chastising him, "Have you lost it, man? Luciana's not the type to forgive and forget. Why'd you tell her to look after Josephine? Aren't you afraid she'll leave?"

Stephen's lips curved into a careless smile, his tone lazy and detached. "Josie got pregnant and wanted to get rid of it. My mother's been nagging about a grandchild anyway, so this kills two birds with one stone. It's less pressure on Lucy that way."

His friend snorted. "And after the baby's born? You think you can just send Josephine away? Come on, man, just admit you're into her. Otherwise, you wouldn't have hired the other nine women to play their parts without even touching them."

Stephen had been read like a book. He stayed silent for a long while.

"Lucy's like a red rose—beautiful, but covered in thorns. She keeps everyone at arm's length," he said. "But Josephine's… different. She makes me feel needed… makes me want to protect her."

He exhaled slowly. "Besides, I've stayed faithful for three years. Maybe it's time Lucy gave a little something back."

Luciana froze where she stood. It felt like a bucket of ice water had drenched her from head to toe. She stumbled back into the bedroom and slid helplessly down the wall to the floor.

Her eyes fell on the drawer across the room. Inside was a blank divorce agreement, which Stephen had signed before their wedding, a gesture meant to ease her doubts.

He had scrawled his name across it, not because he planned to use it, but to promise her that, no matter what, he was devoted to her.

"Lucy, I'll love you forever. This agreement will never take effect," he had proclaimed.

Her fingers brushed over the ink of his name, a bitter smile pulling on her face. 

"Oh, Stephen. Was your idea of forever only three years?" Luciana thought. 

She should've known better than to believe a playboy's promise.

…

The divorce papers slid across the counter at the courthouse.

Before leaving, Luciana dialed Blake Zabrowski's number. "Dr. Zabrowski, I've decided to join the Humanitarian Outreach Program."

Blake sounded surprised on the other end. "Mr. Cooper agreed to let you go abroad? Lucy, are you sure you want to do that? It won't be easy out here."

Luciana's eyes burned with determination. She had to get away, no matter what. However, she was currently working at the Cooper family's hospital. If Stephen found out, he would never let her go.

The deployment roster had to be kept confidential.

"I'll meet the team at the overseas base in 30 days," she said.

When the call ended, Luciana felt the weight on her chest increasing. By the time she returned to the Cooper residence, dusk had fallen.

The villa glowed with warm lights, but the sight that greeted her was a bunch of baby supplies, diamond trinkets piled like mountains, and pastel ribbons tied to bassinets.

Liz turned at the sound of her footsteps. Her faint smile disappeared the moment she saw Luciana.

A flick of her eyes sent the housemaids scurrying away before she pulled a sleek bank card from her purse and placed it before Luciana. "This is five million dollars. Take it and leave my son. We don't keep unnecessary people around here."

Had this happened in the past, Luciana would've refused without hesitation. But now…

Luciana lifted her gaze and looked through the window. In the reflection, she saw Stephen's faint smile. His broad hand rested lightly on Josephine's belly, his gaze carrying that tender affection he once reserved for her.

They were out picking a crib together. Not long ago, he had strictly forbidden any baby-related items in the villa, fearing they would hurt her.

"Sure," Luciana replied, letting the sorrow fade from her eyes. "I've already signed the divorce agreement. When the time comes, I'll leave. He'll never be able to find me again."

Farewell, homeland.
