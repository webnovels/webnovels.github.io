All the elderly patients were lying in their beds, breathing rhythmically, completely unharmed.

The lucid patients even turned their heads to look at me, their eyes full of kindness and gratitude.

Seeing this, my eyes instantly welled up with tears.

Sometimes I really don't need them to thank me verbally or give me honorary banners.

Just one grateful look makes me feel that all my efforts were worthwhile.

At this moment, a 90-year-old patient reached out his hand, gesturing for me to come over.

After a period of treatment, his condition had clearly improved and he could speak clearly and forcefully.

"Dr. James, you've worked so hard these past days."

"If you hadn't saved me in time last night, I surely would have died. Thank you, thank you so much."

The family members who had been cursing me just moments ago were now all struck dumb.

They stood rooted to the spot, completely motionless.

When they came to their senses, they rushed in to find their parents, eyes brimming with tears, overcome with emotion.

"Mom, are you alright?"

"Dad, I thought I'd never see you again."

After confirming their parents were alive, many family members knelt down and kowtowed to me.

"Dr. James, I'm so sorry for wrongly accusing you."

Others slapped themselves and pounded the ground in remorse.

"I'm not human."

"Dr. James, you worked so hard to save my mom, but I believed others' false accusations and was convinced you killed her. I even shouted about killing you. I'm the one who's worse than an animal!"

Seeing so many people apologizing and begging forgiveness, I quickly told them to get up.

Although they beat me to death in my previous life, it was because they had seen their parents actually dead and lashed out in extreme grief.

Ultimately, it was Linda and Emily's fault. They were the true culprits.

The police officer who had been about to handcuff me now understood the truth and took the initiative to apologize.

"Dr. James, we didn't investigate thoroughly and almost caused a terrible mistake. We wronged you."

"I sincerely apologize to you. I'm so sorry."

I immediately helped them up, smiling.

"It's alright. It was just a misunderstanding. Now that it's cleared up, everything's fine."

"Since the elderly patients are all okay, we'll be leaving now."

I quickly reached out to stop them, glancing at Linda and Emily.

"Officer, now that you can prove I didn't kill those 200 elderly patients, how should we deal with the people who maliciously slandered me and even produced fake evidence?"

The police officer followed my gaze to the mother and daughter pair.

He immediately went over to question them: "You insisted when you called that Dr. James killed 200 elderly patients. You even incited these family members to nearly cause him bodily harm."

"How do you explain yourself now?"

Linda was startled, her face changing dramatically. She unconsciously took a step back.

I had thought she would immediately admit her mistake and beg forgiveness, but I didn't expect her to continue spewing vicious lies.

"Officer, don't believe his nonsense!"

The police officer snorted angrily and pointed at Linda, berating her:

"You're still slandering Dr. James as talking nonsense? The elderly patients are all fine now. Who's really talking nonsense?"

"Also, didn't you say you had evidence proving Dr. James was the murderer? Where's the evidence?"

"If you can't produce it, I won't let you escape legal punishment!"
