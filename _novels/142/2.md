I shrugged helplessly and said with resignation:

"Over 200 elderly patients and just one doctor - how could I save them all?"

"I can't be in multiple places at once. How could I possibly get all your parents out at the same time?"

"If I save this one, I can't save that one. Someone was bound to die. Which of you would be willing to let your own parents stay behind to die?"

In my previous life, I had wanted to say this.

Back then, I desperately went to connect the backup power supply. But each power unit weighed over 150 pounds. After finishing, I collapsed from exhaustion.

When I saw the elderly patients were all safe and sleeping peacefully, I felt it was worth all the hardship and fatigue.

But when I woke up, everyone was accusing me of causing the elderly patients to suffocate to death.

Even these family members who had just been praising my ethics believed it without a doubt.

They beat and kicked me without letting me explain, beating me to death.

Saving lives was my duty. I didn't expect gratitude from everyone. But since they all thought I was a murderer, I might as well not bother.

Before I finished speaking, the family members completely lost it.

They angrily surged towards me, their imposing manner exactly the same as when they beat me to death in my previous life.

Linda saw the moment had come and rushed up to slap me.

"James, you're the head of our ICU. You just received an award last month. How can you be so inhumane?"

"Your daughter righteously exposed the truth, but not only do you make excuses, you're here saying cold-hearted things."

"Who would be willing to let their parents die? Even if you only saved a few, at least it would show you tried your best."

"But you didn't save a single one. You're worse than an animal!"

Seeing the mother and daughter speaking in perfect unison, I sighed softly and didn't argue.

I wanted to see how they would continue to frame me.

Linda gave Emily a look.

Emily immediately took out a pre-prepared video and played it for everyone at maximum volume.

In the video, I was ranting like a madman, spewing complaints and vicious words.

"Looking at you old geezers who won't die makes me sick."

"You're all 70 or 80 years old. Why don't you just die already instead of clinging to life? You're just wasting air and resources."

"What are you looking at? Sooner or later I'm going to shut off your ventilators and let you all suffocate."

In my previous life, Emily posted this video online, causing outrage across the internet.

The family members swarmed me, punching and kicking, slapping my face, even stabbing me with knives, beating me to death.

The real culprits were this mother and daughter pair.

Coming back to my senses, I still felt pain all over my body.

At this point, Linda could no longer hide the wild joy in her eyes, but she still put on a righteous act.

"James, I've been your wife for 20 years, yet I never realized you were a wolf in sheep's clothing."

"The whole hospital has power except your unit, and it just happens to be during your shift. You're the murderer!"

Emily shook her head in disappointment.

"I don't have a father like you! You taught me to respect the elderly, but now you've killed 200 elderly patients with your own hands. You deserve to be cut into a thousand pieces."

Incited by the mother and daughter, the family members now all had bloodshot eyes, like angry beasts ready to tear me to pieces.

"Scum! I treated you like a lifesaving benefactor. Ptooey! You're not even human."

"You butcher! My mom raised me through thick and thin, and you killed her. I'll make you pay blood for blood!"

"We came from far away for you to save lives. But you killed my dad. I want your life!"

The family members who had been kicking the door now surrounded me from behind, about to attack.

At this critical moment, a stern shout froze everyone.

"Stop!"

Everyone turned to look.

Seven or eight police officers rushed in, separating the crowd.

"Someone reported that a doctor at this hospital abused his position to deliberately kill elderly patients. Who is James? Come with us."

The family members glared at me fiercely, their fingers almost jabbing my face.

"It's this butcher who killed my dad! Arrest him and execute him!"

"Why waste words on this scum? Kill him!"

"A life for a life. Kill him!"

The scene from my previous life was playing out again.

It all seemed meticulously planned in advance, with everything falling into place.

If I hadn't lived through this once before, I would surely be at a loss now and fall victim to their scheme again.

After calming myself, I looked at the police and said calmly:

"I didn't kill anyone."

"You need evidence to accuse me of murder. Otherwise it's malicious defamation, and I will pursue legal action!"

Linda laughed coldly and immediately smiled ingratiatingly at the police.

"Officer, I'm the one who called the police. I'm also his wife Linda and a doctor at this hospital."

"I have ironclad evidence that can prove James killed 200 elderly patients!"

Hearing this, the police officers instantly became highly alert.

"200 elderly patients? This is no joke. Can you take responsibility for what you're saying?"

Linda patted her chest and said, "The ICU has always had an independent power supply. Even if the whole hospital lost power, it shouldn't be possible here. But last night the power was out for 10 hours. It must have been deliberate. Also, I can guarantee with 100% certainty that James' fingerprints will be on the power switch!"

Seeing her speak so confidently, the gathered family members became even more enraged and tried to rush forward to hit me.

If not for the police officers desperately holding them back, I would have been beaten to death already.

Instead of retreating, I stepped forward and shouted:

"If you kill me, you'll never know who really murdered your parents."

Linda and Emily exchanged a glance, both looking a bit guilty, before continuing to shout defiantly.

"The evidence is irrefutable. Are you still trying to deny it?"

"James, I advise you to confess quickly, or it will only get worse for you!"

"Officer, don't believe my dad's lies. Every time he does something wrong he refuses to admit it. Take him away quickly."

Some family members who had hesitated after hearing my words now all prostrated themselves, weeping bitterly.

"Mom, your son is unfilial. I entrusted you to this heartless beast for treatment, causing you to die tragically."

"Officer, my dad had late-stage cancer. His last wish was to see his family again. Now it's all been ruined by this animal."

"A life for a life. He killed 200 elderly people. We'll give him 200 stab wounds, not one less!"

Looking at the over 100 wailing family members, the police officer angrily grabbed my arm.

"So many people are accusing you of being the murderer."

"James, please come with us to cooperate with our investigation and clear things up."

Seeing him take out handcuffs, I calmly blocked his hand.

"I didn't kill anyone. You have no right to arrest me!"

Turning around, I entered the passcode on the lock.

Beep. The steel door slowly opened.

At this moment, I felt incredibly relieved. It was finally time for me to fight back.
