My best friend and I were transported to a tribe of shapeshifters.
She became the substitute for the aloof Raptor Priest's idealized love,
While I ended up as the devoted pet of a possessive Snake King with two formidable appendages.
We used our modern knowledge to greatly improve the tribe's infrastructure.
But the tribe's holy woman branded us as heretics and brutally murdered us.
Beheaded and torn apart, our bodies were left in pieces.
When I opened my eyes again, I immediately grabbed my backpack and knocked on my friend's door,
"Ready to die?"
"Let's die together."
After our demise, both our husbands went mad.

When the Raptor Priest returned, Lily and I were figuring out what to do with our last box of supplies.

She carefully sorted through the items at the bottom of the box. From small bottles of hot sauce to folding tents, everything was precious. Over the years, we had unknowingly accumulated a small warehouse through our efforts to modernize the tribe.

She crouched on the ground, examining each item with interest. As I stood beside her, I felt both envious and proud.

Suddenly, an urgent announcement came from outside:

"The High Priest has returned to the tribe!"

Lily jumped up in an instant.

Without hesitation, she shoved me along with the packages under the bed:

"Hide well and don't make a sound!"

Her strength was frightening. She handed me a three-kilogram pot as if it weighed nothing more than a feather.

"If that priestess makes a move first, use this to bash her!"

Just as she finished speaking, the door was kicked open with a loud bang by the Raptor Priest.

Although "priest" was a civilized title, the man before us was still very much a predator.

His height nearly blocked out the light from outside, his body covered in sleek muscles.

One look down from him was enough to make one's heart tremble.

Lily, who had just been engrossed in sorting supplies, now raised her head with tears in her eyes, looking so helpless she seemed about to shatter:

"Why didn't you send word of your return so I could welcome you properly?..."

She choked back a sob, her voice filled with resentment.

The Raptor Priest's gaze shifted, his voice like a crack in a glacier:

"Where have you hidden Sophia?"

"Sophia is missing?!"

Lily's face was full of shock, not looking like an act at all.

"How many times have I told you, she is the holy woman guided by the gods. My intimate rituals with her are destined by fate."

His patience was like thin ice. Before he finished speaking, his eyes had already turned gloomy, making one's scalp tingle:

"You meet her in private once, and she vanishes without a trace. Now you're still trying to put on an act for me?"

"I really don't know. She called me over, saying she wanted to talk..."

Lily's voice trembled softly as she reached out to grasp the hem of the Raptor Priest's robe, only to be coldly shaken off.

The force was too strong, instantly leaving a red mark on Lily's wrist.

She shivered, tears streaming down her face.

Seeing the mark, the priest paused for a moment before turning to leave:

"Without my orders, don't take half a step out of this room!"

After he spoke, the hem of his robe disappeared through the doorway.

Lily was left wailing and pleading:

"My lord, please stay... don't go..."

Her sorrowful voice lingered in the air as I stared wide-eyed from under the bed.

Lily's acting skills had improved.

As soon as the man's figure turned out of sight, Lily immediately locked the door, wiped her face, and said:

"You can come out now. The show has begun."

"Sophia's started making trouble. After messing with the priest, it'll be your snake's turn."

"I think so too."

I crawled out and looked back at the spoils of war scattered on the floor. Lily and I exchanged glances, and I cleared my throat:

"Ready to die?"

Lily nodded without hesitation:

"We must die to teach those men a lesson."
