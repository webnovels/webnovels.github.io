My reckless action immediately drew everyone's attention.

Finn rushed over to comfort Lydia, while Jasper slapped me twice.

Seeing their treasured friend kicked away, my brothers were heartbroken and angrily glared at me.

"Adeline, have you lost your mind, daring to hit our sister!"

Looking at my aggressive brothers, I realized how foolish I was to ever think they felt sibling affection for me.

Pointing at Lydia, whom they were protecting, I loudly mocked, "She's just a mistress. Am I, the rightful daughter of the corporation and granddaughter of the wealthiest, not qualified to hit her?"

Hearing this, Finn was instantly enraged and pushed me to the ground.

"Adeline, Lydia kindly funded your education, yet here you are, spouting nonsense."

"Everyone here, listen up. Lydia is my grandmother's real granddaughter and the true heiress of SkyRise Corporation."

I looked at Finn in disbelief.

"She's my grandmother's real granddaughter? The heiress of SkyRise Corporation?

"Finn, how dare you say such things? You have some nerve!"

Jasper rolled his eyes at me disdainfully.

"Adeline, did you forget to take your meds today? You're losing it again."

Lydia then started to cry hypocritically.

"It's all my fault. I knew Adeline had mental issues, yet I still brought her here."
