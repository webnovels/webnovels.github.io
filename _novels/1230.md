The intern who ranked dead last in company performance just landed a manager position, all thanks to my husband.

I’d been overseas for a six-month executive program, and her salary tripled.

On my first day back, the girl publicly splashed coffee all over my new custom-tailored Armani suit.

“Marcus said that if I wanted your job, all he has to do is say the word.”

I countered by slapping her termination papers right onto her chest.

My husband and his entire inner circle responded by throwing their own resignation letters onto my desk.

“Unless you reinstate her immediately, we all walk today.”

I smiled. “Perfect. I’ll replace all of you, starting with you.”

The air in the spacious conference room was thick, frozen solid.

All eyes were fixed on Marcus Shaw.

And why wouldn’t they be? Every single person currently in the room was a loyalist he’d personally promoted.

The senior staff I had trained and mentored? They had either been systematically sidelined or politely phased out by him under various pretexts over the last six months.

Sienna Tate saw the clear shift in momentum and didn't even bother pretending anymore. She leaned back in her chair, crossed her legs, and a look of unconcealed mockery danced in her eyes.

“Ms. Rhodes,” she purred, using my formal title with maximum disdain. “See this? You trying to move me? It’s not going to be that easy.”

“As long as Marcus is on my side, no one in this room can touch me.”

“And I hate to break it to you, but these days, Marcus is the one calling the shots at Aether Advisors, inside and out. You? You’re just a very expensive figurehead.”

She chuckled, then reached for the coffee cup on the table. Finding it empty, a junior associate scrambled to her side to refill it. The steam rose, and the smug triumph on her face was almost blinding.

“How does that feel? A little tight in the chest?”

“Too bad. You’re just going to have to swallow it.”

The conference room was meant to be a place of quiet focus, but Sienna couldn't care less, her voice becoming sharper with every word. Seeing my silence only fueled her.

“Honestly, ‘Department Manager’ sounds a little boring anyway. I saw your corner office—the view looks incredible from up there.”

This was no longer a subtle grab; it was open coveting of my position as CEO. I truly didn’t understand her audacity. What gave her this bulletproof confidence?

I shifted my gaze, sweeping over the stack of glaring white resignation letters, then slowly looked up, meeting every pair of eyes in the room.

“Have you all thought this through? You’re going to use your careers as leverage to force my hand, all for her?”

“Is she—an underperforming employee who has done nothing but cause problems—worth sacrificing your futures for? Really?”

I found the whole situation darkly amusing, and I leaned back against the leather seat, truly baffled by their collective choice.

“Camille, you’re missing the point.” Marcus’s voice cut in, cold and sharp.

“They aren’t doing this for her. They are doing it for me. I am the one who controls their future here. Your words no longer carry any weight.”

The moment the words left his mouth, the conference room door swung open, and the assembled staff respectfully chorused:

“Mr. Shaw.”

Each one of those "Mr. Shaw’s" landed like a fresh, stinging slap across my face.

Aether Advisors wasn't his—it was my blood, sweat, and vision. I was the sole founder.

Yet, now, these employees only saw Marcus.

“Good, everyone’s here.”

Marcus visibly relished the deference, his face alight with the calm confidence of a man in control. He looked at me, a curl of cruel mockery on his lip.

“You see the situation. Withdraw the termination, reinstate Sienna immediately, or they all walk. You can’t afford the fallout of a core team collapse. You simply can’t handle the mess.”

Listening to Marcus’s ruthless threats, my nails dug deep into my palms.

I couldn’t understand why he was pushing this, why he would go to such lengths for an outsider. We were husband and wife.

“Marcus, are you out of your mind?”

“You’re colluding with outsiders to take me down?”

My voice trembled with anger. If I didn’t still have a thread of residual feeling for him, the pain wouldn’t have cut so deep.

I knew better than anyone: a mass walkout of the core team meant catastrophic destruction for the firm.

“Outsider?” Marcus scoffed. “Sienna is like family. I’ve mentored her, watched her grow, and I won’t stand by while she’s bullied.”

“I gave her a small promotion. Why did you have to turn this into a war, terminating her just to spite me?”

When had I ever tried to spite him? This was a calculated smear.

“What benefits did Sienna bring the firm in the last six months to justify a meteoric rise to Department Manager?”

“As far as I know, not only did she fail to contribute, but her gross negligence cost us the contracts with Crestwood Holdings and Zenith Capital. The direct loss is over two million dollars.”

I hadn’t pursued legal action against her—that was my mercy. And now they wanted me to compromise?

Hearing me bring up old failings, the smile vanished from Sienna’s face, and she immediately turned a look of wounded innocence on Marcus.

“Marcus, listen to her! She failed to close those clients herself, but she’s making me take the fall! She’s deliberately giving me impossible projects, just so I can’t succeed. She’s professionally bullying me!”

Her words were the spark. Marcus’s loyalists—his former college peers and recruits—erupted into indignation.

“A boss who sabotages staff instead of supporting them? That’s appalling!”

“Exactly. There’s no future with an owner like that. We have to stand with Sienna!”

“We won’t bow to this injustice!”

In an instant, the conference room was filled with a flurry of accusations, as if I were the ruthless, evil one.

I watched these unfamiliar faces with cold detachment. All of them had been slotted in by Marcus during the six months I was gone.

I was beginning to understand exactly what Marcus was attempting.

He was trying to isolate and neutralize me.

I thought back to when he first arrived—a young intern whose carelessness nearly got him fired, a kid who could only hang his head and apologize when he messed up.

If I hadn't come down with a severe stomach bug that one time, and if he hadn’t carried me downstairs and rushed me to the emergency room… I probably never would have noticed him. I wouldn’t have taken him under my wing, and I certainly wouldn't have… fallen in love with him.

I never imagined his ambition was this vast, his appetite this greedy.

But this little squall? He thought this was enough to capsize my ship? He was gravely mistaken.

I casually picked up the top resignation letter, weighed it in my hand, then tossed it back onto the table in front of Marcus with a look of utter scorn.

“Threatening me? I’m Camille Rhodes. I’ve seen worse than this.”

“Anyone who wants to leave, you are free to process your paperwork now. The door is open. Don’t let it hit you on the way out.”

My words stunned the room into silence. Everyone exchanged uneasy glances. They hadn't anticipated that I would simply refuse to bend to their coercion.

Marcus’s face instantly darkened, his expression so grim it looked like rain would pour from it.

“Are you sure you want to play this game?”

“What did you expect? Isn’t this exactly what you wanted?”

“You want to threaten me with resignations? Threats are the one thing Camille Rhodes does not fear.”

“This firm can run without anyone. If you want to walk, I won’t beg you to stay.”

Sienna panicked, grabbing Marcus’s arm.

“Marcus, what is this…?”

“Don’t worry. I’m here. She can’t touch you.”

Marcus stood up and walked toward me.

“I forgot to mention one thing, Camille. This firm? It’s mine now.”

“I wanted to be decent, let you keep your title, let you take your dividends quietly—after all, I owe you. But since you insisted on making a scene, don’t blame me for letting go of the past.”

“What does that mean?”

I met his icy gaze, lifting my chin.

Marcus smiled, reaching out to pat my shoulder, but I deliberately shifted, avoiding his touch. Unfazed, he lowered his hand and adjusted his cuff links.

“It means I’ve secured the support of the other partners and completed an internal vote. I am the de facto controller of Aether Advisors. I choose who works here and who doesn’t. Understood?”

Sienna nearly jumped for joy.

“Marcus! Is that true?”

Marcus gave her a confirming nod.

Sienna immediately rushed to hug his arm, jutting her chin up at me in blatant victory. The others in the room seemed to find this familiarity normal, relieved only that they had backed the winning side.

The fire of rage burned at its peak in my chest.

Behind my back, Marcus had not only betrayed our marriage but was now attempting to steal my life’s work.

“Haha, are you mad?”

Sienna’s laughter was brazen.

“Good. You should be. I might as well tell you: whatever wifely affection you two shared died completely the last time he flew overseas to see you.”

“The night before you returned? We were together. Oh, and I’m pregnant. It’s Marcus’s baby.”

“You know, you’re not a very successful wife, are you?”

The eyes of the employees around me were filled with mocking curiosity, devoid of any respect.

As Marcus had said, this was no longer my ground.

Though I remained outwardly calm, my inner world was a sea of turmoil.

I had underestimated Marcus’s cruelty. No wonder Sienna was so arrogant; my good husband had given her every reason to be.

They all thought I was finished.

I swept the stack of resignation letters onto the floor, slowly stood up, and faced the couple.

“The company I built with my own hands? You think you can just take it?”

“I am still the corporate representative of this firm. I have not signed any stock transfer agreements. I will ask you again: By what right is my company now yours?”

Marcus didn’t get angry; he just laughed. He casually loosened his tie, pulling Sienna closer into his embrace.

“I figured you’d say that. So, I prepared a little ‘gift’ just for you.”

“Please, gentlemen, come in.”

The conference room door was pushed open again, and several men walked in.

They were the other founding partners of Aether Advisors. Right now, their eyes were directed only at Marcus, completely ignoring my presence.

“What… what is the meaning of this?”

A chill snaked up from my gut.

“Can’t you tell?”

Sienna eagerly piped up, her voice sickly sweet.

“These men are here to support Marcus! They’re here to ask you… to permanently leave Aether!”

Sienna’s answer earned her a look of approval from Marcus.

“Sweetheart, you’re getting the perfect executive wife demeanor.”

Marcus turned to me, his eyes now filled only with greed and chilling detachment.

“Once you take over, Marcus, you have to let me sit in the managing partner’s chair. I want to feel what it’s like to be the boss!” Sienna cooed, playing the role.

Her level of competence? She barely managed the manager role. Managing Partner was a pipe dream.

Marcus straightened, facing all the partners, his voice clear and resonant.

“Gentlemen, since Camille is here, let’s get a show of hands so no one can accuse me of acting dishonorably.”

The words were barely out of his mouth when the partners spoke in unison:

“We support Mr. Shaw!”

That single, collective sentence was like an array of icy darts, stabbing into my heart.

These partners were the people I had fought alongside, starting from a tiny shared cubicle. We were more than just partners; we were comrades.

How could they all have defected to Marcus after I was gone for only six months?

This was an insult I absolutely refused to swallow.

“Why? Tell me, why would you do this?”

My voice was dry and hoarse.

The partners remained expressionless, their tone clinical and cold.

“Mr. Shaw can make us more money. His strategies are more aggressive than yours. We’re businessmen, Camille. It’s purely about profit.”

Purely about profit? The irony was suffocating. Had I shortchanged them on dividends? When had I ever closed a major deal without ensuring they got a generous share? I’d protected them, and they had stabbed me in the back.

Hearing the partners’ declaration, Sienna’s pride was almost uncontrollable.

“Camille, do you hear that? You’re out. Your employees hate you, your partners don’t support you—how pathetic. All these years of hard work, only to hand it all over to us.”

“Why are you still sitting there? Get up.”

“That chair is mine now.”

I completely ignored the jumping jack in front of me, staring only at Marcus and the circle of traitors.

Not a single person spoke up for me. They were all united in forcing me out.

“If you’d only been reasonable and promoted Sienna when I asked, you wouldn’t be in this situation.” Marcus’s voice was triumphant.

“Do you understand now? I made you who you are, and I can just as easily destroy you.”

My clenched fists were white at the knuckles.

Marcus couldn’t wait to see me disgraced. He gave a sharp look toward the security personnel near the door.

“Camille, two options. Walk out on your own and keep some shred of dignity, or let my security team drag you out. Your choice.”

But I, Camille Rhodes, wouldn't choose either.

“Idiot. Without my countersignature, any alleged transfer of equity—even if all of you agree—is legally void.”

“Oh, is that so?”

Marcus had been waiting for this. He threw a document onto the table in front of me. “Then take a good look. You already signed it.”

“Last month when I came to see you, I saw how stressed you were with your studies, so I slipped in a ‘Restorative Retreat Suggestion’ for you to sign, remember? The key clause? It was right in the middle.”

“How about that, Camille? After all these years with you, I didn’t just learn your methods. I learned to use them better than you ever could.”

Seeing my face drop, Sienna seized the opportunity to twist the knife.

“I was there that night, too. You had barely left for your campus when I walked into his hotel room. And it only took once to get pregnant. Thanks for vacating the premises for us!”

I shot up, swinging my hand to slap Marcus, but he caught my wrist.

“Still resorting to violence? Security! Get her out of here!”

Strangely, the security guards didn’t move.

Marcus roared in frustration, “Are you deaf?”

I yanked my hand free and delivered the slap.

“You seem to have forgotten one thing, Marcus. I brought you up from an intern, and I can send you right back to where you started.”
