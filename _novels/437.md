In the midst of a zombie outbreak, my girlfriend insisted on delaying our evacuation. All for the sake of her cowardly, useless childhood friend to catch the last rescue helicopter.

This was the final evacuation operation after the zombie outbreak, and our only chance of survival for our group of survivors.

Seeing that her friend wasn't coming, I had no choice but to knock my girlfriend unconscious and carry her onto the plane.

Her precious childhood friend ultimately died in the zombie horde.

I, however, managed to survive thanks to this opportunity and lived a happy, peaceful life with my girlfriend in the safe zone.

But on the eve of me taking control of the district and preparing to lead the human army in a counterattack...

My girlfriend drugged my water and threw me into a horde of zombies.

She stood on the wall, sneering: "If it weren't for your selfishness, Jake should have had a chance to live too."

"The pain he suffered, you must experience it yourself, and pay for it with your life!"

Given another chance at life, I returned to the day my girlfriend insisted on delaying the evacuation.

Since she's so eager to live and die together with her childhood friend...

I'll send her to feed the zombies along with him!
