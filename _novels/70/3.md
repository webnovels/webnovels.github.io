In seven years, this was probably the first time I openly defied Josephine. She was stunned but quickly sneered:

"Ezra, I'll admit, you've gotten my attention, but you're going about it the wrong way."

"I'm the CEO of this company. If I say you're absent, then you're absent!"

"I've already backed up all the projects and client info you have. Do you really think you're irreplaceable?"

"HR, prepare the termination papers and notify all our partner enterprises to add him to the employment blacklist."

Before HR could make a move, I stopped them:

"No need. I've already prepared resignation letters."

Jasper was overjoyed but pretended to be regretful:

"Ezra, why put yourself through this?"

"Why not apologize to Josephine? She's kind-hearted; considering you cared for her for several years, she'd surely give you a break and let you clean toilets and unclog drains."

Next to him, Josephine, seeing me stop HR, raised her chin arrogantly.

"Didn't expect you to have some self-awareness."

"Tell you what, since you've been a useful tool, if you willingly give up..."

Before Josephine could finish, I interrupted, tossing resignation letters to her and Jasper.

"Enough, no need for small talk. You're both dismissed."

Looking at her own resignation letter, Josephine was momentarily stunned, then scoffed.

"What right does an employee have to fire me?"

I smiled calmly and handed over the shareholder transfer notice.

"Miss Josephine, you've forgotten something important."

"I'm the CEO of this company now."

"Alright, since you're nothing but a convenient lackey, if you voluntarily give up..."

Before Josephine could finish, I cut her off and tossed two termination letters to her and Jasper.

"Enough of the pointless chatter. You both can get out now."

Holding her termination letter, Josephine was momentarily stunned, then sneered with disdain.

"What right do you, just an employee, have to fire me?"

I smiled dismissively and presented the formal notice of shareholder transfer.

"Miss Shen—oh wait, no, Miss Josephine—your esteemed status seems to have made you forgetful."

"Take a good look, I'm the CEO of the company now."

"As for you and Jasper, you're both fired immediately for violating company policy, disrupting workplace order, and stealing company project secrets."
