It was three in the afternoon when Rory Lynn, the newest hire, suddenly @-mentioned me in the company-wide chat—a group with hundreds of people.

[That bitch at desk 203, can you stop drumming on your keyboard? The vibration is giving me a stomachache!]

[My baby is trying to sleep in here. If your noise gives him a concussion, I’ll make sure your whole family pays the price!]

I immediately explained that I was rushing a critical proposal and, for the record, I was using a silent keyboard. But she wouldn't hear it.

I patiently tried to reason with her a few times, and to avoid any further conflict, I even requested permission to move my laptop out to the hallway to work.

I never imagined that a week later, she would burst into the break room, a steaming kettle of freshly boiled water in her hand, and pour it over my head.

I collapsed into the scalding puddle, skin peeling and shredded, yet she still slammed her high heel down on my head like a lunatic, crying hysterically:

"It’s your fault! I miscarried! Your keyboard noise killed my son!!”

My vision blurred, and I finally lost consciousness—never understanding, even as I died, how a silent keyboard could kill a person.

When I opened my eyes again, I was back on the day she first cursed me out in the group chat.

Faced with her familiar abuse, I didn’t back down this time. I fired back immediately, my tone cold and sharp:

"Stop acting like a pregnant woman! Your damn rooster is bigger than mine!"

1

The message hit the group, and the hundreds of people who had been enthusiastically discussing strategies immediately fell silent.

A few seconds later, Rory Lynn’s messages exploded, flooding the screen:

[Anya Reed, what in God’s name are you talking about, you rotten bitch? I’m three months pregnant! My ultrasound reports are right here! How dare you slander me?!]

[Everyone, look! Anya Reed at 203 is just a barren cow who can’t stand to see anyone else have a baby!]

[@HR @Mr. Harrison, if people like this work here, I’m calling the police! This is defamation! This is a personal attack!]

Rory pitched a dramatic fit, and the moment she did, my colleagues rushed to her defense, their accusations pointed squarely at me.

Brenda from the Design Department:

[Anya, you’ve gone too far. How could you say something like that to a pregnant woman? That mouth is poison!]

Another person tried to placate Rory:

[Rory, calm down for the sake of the baby. Maybe Anya was just making a terrible joke.]

Rory wasn't about to let it go:

[A joke? Who makes a joke like that? I have nothing to say to her! She’s just jealous I married well and have my husband's child in my belly!]

[My pregnancy is already high-risk! The doctor told me to stay on strict bed rest!]

[And this whore is over here pounding on her keyboard like a damn jackhammer! If anything happens to my baby, I’m going to skin her alive!]

Other colleagues in the building started chiming in:

[Seriously, Rory said she felt ill. Can’t you just be quiet?]

[It's already late afternoon. Can’t that proposal wait until tomorrow? Why are you picking a fight with a pregnant woman?]

Watching them twist the truth, I started laughing—a cold, humorless sound.

In my previous life, that’s exactly how they had systematically driven me into a corner.

I explained countless times that I had a silent keyboard, and I worked in the stairwell just to accommodate her.

Yet, my reward was her pouring boiling water over me, scalding me from head to toe.

Before I died, my skin was burned off, my skull fractured by her heel, and Rory Lynn’s deranged face was the last thing I ever saw.

I closed my eyes, the scorching pain of the boiling water still a phantom brand on my soul.

Rage and hatred churned in my chest.

Rory was still furiously @-mentioning me in the chat:

[Cat got your tongue? Why aren’t you talking, you cheap whore? Are you feeling guilty?]

[Are you doing this on purpose? You don't want me to have peace, do you? I finally got pregnant, and you’re trying to kill my son, aren’t you?]

[If anything happens to him, can you pay for it? Will you pay with your life?]

“Pay with my life?”

“Should I pay for the shit you’re going to give birth to?”

I stared at those three words, unable to contain my fury any longer. I went to the chat and dropped a voice message in a low, chilling tone:

"Fine. Come over here right now. If you dare to drop your pants in front of the entire company, I, Anya Reed, will jump off this building right here and now, to pay for your son’s life!”

2

My voice message detonated the entire company.

The chat was silent for a full minute. Then, a commotion erupted near my cubicle.

I looked up and saw Rory Lynn, clutching her stomach, being helped by several female colleagues. Her eyes were red as she made her way toward me.

“Anya Reed!”

Her voice was sharp and wailing, laced with tears, as if she were the victim of some immense tragedy.

“How can you be so vicious? What did I ever do to you that you would humiliate me like this?”

“I’m carrying a boy! We’ve been waiting for a son for generations! Are you that determined to ruin us?”

The women next to her immediately burst out with indignation:

“Anya, you are a monster! Rory just started working here, and you’re bullying her like this?”

“Exactly! Aren’t you ever going to have children? How can you stand to curse a baby who hasn't even been born?”

“Targeting an unborn baby... don't you worry about karma!”

Rory was still dry-heaving, giving a full-throttle performance. The tears flowed instantly as she leaned weakly on a colleague:

“I’m going to kill you... you ruined my reputation... I'm going to kill you...”

Her sharp cries pierced my eardrums, but they pierced my memories even more.

The thought that this gender-confused lunatic had brutally murdered me once made my body tremble uncontrollably.

Hearing her threaten to kill me again, I couldn't restrain myself. I surged to my feet, shoved the colleague next to him aside, and grabbed his collar.

“Kill me? You already killed me once in another life!”

“Act! Keep acting for me! Where is your stomach? Where is your ultrasound? Let me see it!”

He was stunned by my sudden force, freezing for a few seconds. Then, he suddenly lunged, claws aimed for my face.

I quickly dodged, my foot shooting out in a precise trip.

With a loud thud, he pitched forward and crashed onto the floor.

The searing pain of the boiling water being poured over my head flashed back, instantly boiling my blood.

I planted a foot firmly on his back, grabbing his smooth, long wig and slamming his head down onto the tile.

“Pretend! Act! I’m going to find out what you really are today!”

Pinned down by my foot, Rory could only let out a pig-like shriek:

“Ah! Help me! Anya Reed has gone crazy! She’s trying to kill me! My stomach... my baby...”

His agonizing screams drew even more colleagues.

They rushed forward, grabbing us with whatever hands they could find, forcibly pulling us apart.

I was held fast by two male colleagues, still struggling to catch my breath.

Only half an hour had passed since my rebirth.

That meant only thirty minutes ago, I had been killed by this monster!

How could I possibly be calm?!

But as soon as they had me contained, everyone turned on me, pointing and yelling:

“Anya, are you insane? This whole thing started because of your foul mouth, and now you’re physically assaulting a pregnant woman?”

“I never realized we had such a vicious person in this office!”

“I’ve already called Security! If you try to fight again, we’re calling the police immediately!”

Without my foot pinning him down, Rory’s arrogance returned.

He was helped up, clutching his belly, pointing at me and sobbing dramatically:

“See, everyone? She’s just jealous! She wants to kill my baby!”

He staggered toward me, raising his hand to slap me.

I tried to fight back, but the male colleagues held me in a viselike grip.

“You want to hit back?! Just calm down!”

Seeing me immobilized, Rory’s face twisted into a smug, triumphant sneer. His insults became fouler:

“You barren piece of trash! You deserve to rot in the ground!”

The other colleagues continued to berate me for a lack of empathy.

Brenda, the woman who had helped Rory up, soothed him while shooting me a hateful look:

“You’re a grown woman with no shame! You drove a pregnant woman to this state just over a proposal. What is wrong with you?”

“Rory is pregnant, and it’s hard enough for her to work. If you cause her any complications, how will you be able to take responsibility?”

I struggled against the men holding me, shouting my defense:

“How many times do I have to explain? I use a silent keyboard! How am I bothering him? Am I transmitting my noise through telepathy?”

“And furthermore, he says he’s pregnant—has any of you seen his prenatal reports? Has any of you seen her husband pick her up?”

My question made a few people hesitate, a flicker of doubt in their eyes.

Rory, however, immediately pulled a crumpled piece of paper from his bag:

“This is my ultrasound report! It clearly says twelve weeks gestation!”

I gave a cold laugh:

“A minute ago you said my keyboard was like a jackhammer, making your stomach hurt. Now you’re screaming and fighting, making this huge scene, and your precious son is perfectly fine?”

Everyone was momentarily stunned.

Brenda muttered to herself:

“Yeah, when I was pregnant, I got stressed just hearing loud noises... is Rory’s baby exceptionally tough?”

At that moment, the security guard rushed in, saw the volatile scene, and immediately spoke up:

“Everyone, calm down! Let’s discuss this peacefully!”

Rory, who had been so arrogant a moment before, suddenly clutched his mouth and dry-heaved.

After a long pause, he said weakly:

“I can’t... My stomach hurts so bad... I must have gone into premature labor after being pushed by her!”

“I need a hospital! If my baby is gone, Anya Reed, I will haunt you!”

I wasn't about to let him escape so easily.

“Fine! To the hospital! I’ll go with you! And I’ll make sure to book you a consultation with an urologist to check on your prostate!”

Rory instantly went ballistic, pointing his finger at my face and shrieking:

“You... you maniac! You’re lying! I’ll sue you for defamation!”

I turned to the crowd:

“You all heard that, right? The truth will be known at the hospital. If he turns out to be pregnant, I will publicly bow down and apologize to him, and I will cover all his medical bills!”

Then, I turned to Rory:

“Do you dare to go?”

With that, I grabbed him, pulling him toward the door.

“Let’s go! Right now! Let the whole company see whether you’re carrying a baby or a sack of rotten intentions!”

All the colleagues and I stared at him, waiting for an answer.

Rory’s face cycled from bright red to sickly white.

He never dreamed that the soft target he had terrorized in the last life would come back as a prickly, raging maniac this time.

He held onto the desk for dear life, refusing to move an inch.

But then, as if something clicked, he let out a loud THOOMP and collapsed straight to the floor.

A puddle of “blood” quickly spread out from beneath him.

He reached out a trembling hand and pointed at me, his eyes full of pure malice:

“My baby... Anya Reed... you killed my baby!”
