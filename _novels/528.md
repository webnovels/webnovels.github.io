My home was about to be submerged by floodwaters, but my rescue captain husband took all his team members to save the woman he’d always pined for – Celeste.
That’s when I knew: he’d also been reborn.

In my last life, when my husband found out I was in danger, he rushed to save me. Because of that, he missed Celeste’s call. She had a severe depressive episode and ended up taking her own life. But right before she did, she posted online, claiming I’d cyberbullied her for years and stolen her beloved. After her death, I was cyberbullied relentlessly. My husband, Julian, said he didn't blame me and treated me as he always had.

But on the day I gave birth, he broke my limbs and my baby’s. Then, in front of Celeste’s grave, he threw my son and me into a small, portable tub.
“I never would have married you if I’d known you’d been bullying Celeste for so many years!”
“You can swim, yet you deliberately called me to save you. It’s all your fault Celeste took her own life!”
I listened to my baby’s heartbreaking cries, and died in despair.

When I opened my eyes again, it was this very day – the flood.
This time, let him go save his precious Celeste.
