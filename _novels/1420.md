At my male friend Daniel's engagement party, his phone suddenly got ninety-nine extremely explicit videos.
He freaked out, wanting to delete them, but his fiancée, Scarlett, snatched the phone right out of his hand.
Scarlett had always seen me as a thorn in her side, convinced there was something inappropriate going on between Daniel and me.
I never thought that during the climax of the ring exchange ceremony, she would force me to connect my phone to the big screen.
I broke out in a sweat, desperately holding down the screen mirroring button and trying to dissuade her.
"Scarlett, these videos really can't be played..."
But Scarlett's face twisted with venomous resentment, and she shoved me hard in front of all the guests.
"Now you care this? When you were busy seducing my fiancé, why didn't you ever consider what a day like this would bring?!"
"Today, I'm going to make all our friends see how much of a slut you really are in bed!"
I froze.
But the main characters in those videos were clearly you and Daniel.
