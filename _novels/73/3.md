Adeline's every income was given to Nash unconditionally.

For years, I thought she was modest and had no savings, so while testing drugs, I worked hard to support her dreams.

How ridiculous!

Just then, someone added me on Snapchat.

I opened the profile picture, and my intuition told me it was Nash.

Because the interlocked fingers in the photo, one belonged to Adeline.

She had a burn scar on her hand from a lab accident.

I checked Nash's social media; the latest post was a photo of someone in an apron.

The caption read: [How lucky to have a woman willing to cook for you!]

Adeline once told me she couldn't cook and hated the smell of oil, so even after my surgery, I cooked for her despite the pain.

But with Nash, her principles, likes, and dislikes vanished.

It's not that she didn't like cooking; she just didn't want to cook for me.

I kept scrolling. This Valentine's Day, Adeline took Nash to France and took photos of million-dollar artwork for him.

They kissed in front of the Louvre, rowed on the Seine, and read together in a library.

And that day, Adeline casually ordered me a cake, even writing my name wrong on the card.

Adeline once told me she doesn't cook and despises the smell of grease. So even while recovering from surgery, I had to bear the pain and prepare meals for her. But around Nash, all her principles, preferences, and dislikes seemed to vanish. It's not that she dislikes cooking; she just doesn't want to do it for me.

I continued scrolling. This Valentine’s Day, Adeline took Nash to France and purchased million-dollar artworks for him. They shared a kiss in front of the iconic Louvre, rowed together on the romantic Seine River, and read side by side in the library. Meanwhile, Adeline casually ordered me a cake, even misspelling my name on the card.

For Nash’s birthday, Adeline organized an extravagant fireworks display. That same night, I suffered my second heart attack, almost dying in the hospital.

Tears blurred my vision as I clutched my chest, curling up on the bed, each breath coming with heart-wrenching agony. To Adeline, I was nothing more than a test subject, a stand-in for Nash. She gave everything to Nash, leaving me with hollow concern.

I didn’t sleep all night. Adeline sent me countless messages. I once thought she shared her life with me out of love, but she merely feared I'd notice something was awry, afraid of losing her test subject. This time, I’m afraid I’ll disappoint her. I contacted a staged death agency to help me disappear as soon as possible.

Adeline returned home in the early morning, eagerly embracing me. Her voice was weary, eyes bloodshot. “Honey, I’ve been doing experiments all day. I’m exhausted. Did you miss me?”

In the past, I would have felt sorry for her. But now, I only felt disgust. She doesn't love me, yet she pretends to be deeply in love.

“Are you mad?” She playfully pinched my nose. “I’m not going anywhere today, just staying with you, okay?”

I stayed silent. I was about to leave her. There was no need to keep up this charade.

My phone suddenly rang. Adeline looked puzzled at the message. “What service will be effective in five hours?” I quickly grabbed the phone. It was a message from the staged death agency. Everything was arranged, effective in five hours. I forced a smile, “Nothing, just some company business.”

Though a flicker of doubt crossed Adeline’s eyes, she was confident in my love for her and didn’t press further, just holding my hand, saying, “Honey, I miss you every minute we’re apart. Don’t ever leave me, okay?”

Bitterness welled up in my heart. I nodded. Adeline, soon there will be no more Jude beside you. I’ll be leaving you forever. We should never see each other again.

Before Adeline could change clothes, she got a call. “What? Finn is in trouble? I’ll be right back!” Adeline left in a hurry, without even a glance in my direction. But my heart remained unmoved. Before faking my death, I needed a plausible reason. So, I opened Nash’s chat box.

[I’m Adeline’s husband. Let’s meet.]

When Nash came to meet me, he was still on the phone with Adeline. He deliberately put it on speaker, letting me hear Adeline’s soft, loving voice.

“Finn, why are you wandering around when you’re not well? What would I do if something happened to you?”

Nash wore a triumphant smile. “I miss you so much. When will you give me the medicine you promised? Are you getting feelings for that guy and don’t want to anymore?”

Adeline paused, then laughed helplessly. “You’re the only one in my heart. But someone needs to test it first. I can’t risk you getting hurt.”

Under the table, I clenched my fists, a bitter smile on my face. After hanging up, Nash looked at me tauntingly. “Adeline really goes to great lengths for me.”

His face was full of smugness. His skin was rosy, not at all like someone sick. I turned to look at myself in the mirror, pale and gaunt. Years of testing drugs for Adeline had left me weak.

“Honestly, I’m not sick at all. She had you test the drugs just because I said so.”

I should have known. Adeline is a genius pharmaceutical doctor. How could she not see through Nash’s act? She just loves him too much, enough to let me die.

“I’m not here to fight over Adeline. I’m leaving her, but you need to fulfill one request.” Facing Nash’s mocking gaze, I said firmly, “I just want her laboratory’s new medicine. Since I’m the one testing it anyway, what’s the difference if I take it a little sooner?”

After leaving the hotel, I felt much more relaxed. For the past few days, I stayed close to Adeline. At first, she tried to deal with me patiently, but soon she grew impatient. But I didn’t care, as long as I got the medicine.

Three days later, Nash delivered Adeline’s new medicine to me. After swallowing the pills, I finally felt relieved. Before the staged death agency staff arrived, I packed up everything at home. I shredded all my photos, replaced every frame with pictures of Adeline and Nash. I was leaving, so nothing would stand in their way.

Just before I lay on the hospital bed, my phone rang. Adeline sent me a long voice message, saying she couldn’t spend New Year’s Eve with me because the laboratory was too busy. But in the background, there was the unmistakable announcement of an airport boarding call, reminding her to board the flight to the Maldives.

I knew without asking, Adeline was going on a vacation with Nash. It’s been like this for years. No matter the holiday, she spent it with Nash. Even when I nearly died in the hospital, she still celebrated Nash’s birthday. But now, she didn’t even bother to make excuses.

I smiled bitterly, then closed my eyes as instructed by the staff. I silently told myself. Jude, soon you’ll completely leave Adeline.

At the same time, the moment Adeline landed in the Maldives, she received a call from the hospital back home. Her student’s voice was shaky with panic. “Professor! Jude found out about you and Mr. Nash. He took the new drug from the laboratory. His heart stopped, and he didn’t make it!”
