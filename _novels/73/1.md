"Professor, isn't this too harsh? Jude just got a new artificial heart, and you're making him test a new drug. What if something happens to him..."

Before the student could finish, Adeline's stern voice came from the lab: "It's not your place to lecture me!"

Though I couldn't see her face, just hearing her voice, I knew she was truly angry. Sure enough, the next second, there was the sound of things being thrown.

"He must test the new drug. Finn's too weak and can't wait any longer."

The student didn't dare say more and was about to leave when Adeline called out, hesitating: "To be safe, let's postpone the drug testing to next week and run a few more trials to ensure Jude won't be harmed."

Adeline's words felt like a knife stabbing into my heart, almost making me feel unbearable pain. Has she loved Nash all these years? And I'm just a test subject.

I returned to my room, heartbroken. The chest pain from the artificial heart nearly made me bend over, but the physical pain was nothing compared to the emotional agony.

I collapsed on the bed and glanced at the flowers and medicine bottles on the table, finally bursting into laughter.

I've been married to Adeline for five years, always cherishing her. I thought I was the happiest man in the world, so I willingly became her test subject for her pharmaceutical career.

For five years, I've coughed up blood countless times, developed numerous incurable diseases, and even my heart began deteriorating from frequent drug testing. But I never regretted it. For her, I was willing to risk my life.

I never expected it was all a facade, a lie she meticulously crafted.

"Honey, why do you look so pale?"

"Are you feeling unwell?"

Seeing my pale face, Adeline hurried over, gently cradling me in her arms, massaging my chest with eyes full of concern. In the past, I would have felt happy, grateful for marrying such a caring woman. But now, I only felt coldness.

"It's all my fault for not being by your side."

Adeline's voice was full of guilt. I looked into her sincere eyes, pleading, "Adeline, I just got this new heart. Can I stop testing the drugs?"

A hint of hesitation flashed across her face, and I quickly added, "I'm afraid if there's any rejection, I won't be able to stay with you."

Adeline's gaze fell on my chest, and she sighed, deliberately saying, "Jude, but this drug is crucial for my future."

Her determined look made my nose sting, and my heart felt like it was being torn apart.

To her, my life was less important than that person.

Seeing my distressed face, Adeline quickly assured, "I promise I'll keep you safe."

She pressed her nose to mine, her voice gentle and indulgent, "You're my life; how could I bear to let you get hurt?"

Every word was just a lie.

I felt hopeless, "It's okay, Adeline. I can take it."

Adeline's face lit up with joy, but she said, "This is the last time, honey. I won't let you be in any danger again."

Held in her warm embrace, I felt nothing but cold.

That night, I couldn't sleep.

At dawn, Adeline's phone rang. The man on the other end sounded jealous and sarcastic. Adeline gently reassured him and left without hesitation.

Listening to the door close, I recalled last night's conversation. She must be going to see that man, the one I risked my life to protect.
