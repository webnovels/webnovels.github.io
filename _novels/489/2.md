From that day on, Mia Foster changed.

When Tyler came home drunk again, wanting to get handsy with me like usual, I didn't dodge.

As he approached, I grabbed the ashtray from the table and smashed it against his forehead.

He clutched his bleeding forehead, looking at me in disbelief.

"You dare hit me?!"

I coldly looked at him. "Get lost."

He cursed and charged at me. I dodged to the side, simultaneously knocking out a small packet of white powder hidden in his pocket.

His face changed drastically as he hurriedly tried to pick it up.

I didn't give him the chance, immediately calling the police on my phone.

"Hello, police? I'd like to report drug use and illegal gambling."

When Tyler was taken away by the police, his eyes were full of hatred.

Linda and Frank naturally took out their anger on me.

Linda pointed at my nose and cursed, "You ungrateful bitch! You jinx! How dare you hurt your brother!"

Frank raised his hand to hit me.

I didn't dodge, instead meeting his gaze and speaking.

"Dad, you didn't come home last night. Were you at that widow Jenny's house down the street?"

"I saw you, you know. She had her arms around your neck, calling you 'darling'."

Frank's face instantly turned pale, his raised hand frozen in mid-air.

Linda was stunned for a moment, then pounced on Frank like a madwoman, scratching and hitting.

"You bastard, Frank! How dare you cheat on me!"

"I'll kill you!"

The house instantly descended into chaos.

The news of her husband's affair was enough to keep Linda occupied for a while.

She wouldn't have the energy to cause me trouble for now.

I coldly watched all this, feeling no ripples in my heart.

This was just the beginning.

Using Emily Foster's memories from my past life, I had accumulated some knowledge and insight into the financial markets.

I used the little money Mia had secretly saved as seed capital and made a few short-term trades in the stock market.

Luck was on my side, and I earned my first chunk of startup capital.

I kept quiet about it, secretly moving out and renting a small studio apartment in the city.

I bought a few well-fitting clothes and applied light makeup.

The girl in the mirror had shed her previous timidity and dullness.

Though still thin, her eyes were calm and sharp.

This face looked so much like Emily Foster's.

Enough to make Alexander Carter lose his composure.

I knew Alexander Carter's habits.

Every Friday afternoon, he would go to a teahouse in the west of the city.

It was the place he and his first love used to love going to.

How devoted.

I timed it perfectly and walked into the teahouse.

I chose a seat by the window and ordered the most ordinary green tea.

Before long, Alexander Carter's figure appeared.

He was wearing a well-tailored black suit, handsome and dignified.

He walked straight towards his usual private room.

As he passed by me, his footsteps faltered.

I could feel his gaze on me, scrutinizing and uncertain.

I didn't look up, pretending to be focused on the view outside, my fingers unconsciously tracing the rim of the cup.

From the corner of my eye, I saw him standing there, looking at me for a full half minute.

Then he continued towards the private room, though his steps seemed to have slowed.
