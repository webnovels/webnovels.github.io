I was pinned against the hockey rink locker room wall by Alpha Jace, making out passionately.

After it was over, I got dressed and was about to leave when I overheard his friends mocking me.

"She was moaning so loud the whole rink could hear! More shameless than a prostitute!"

"Are you really going to marry an Omega?"

Jace shrugged.

"Mira is just a sex toy. The one I'm really going to mark is Helena. Only she's worthy of bearing my heir."

My face went pale.

So that was why Jace had never marked me in all our three year.

I was his mate, but the one he loved was my own sister, Helena.

The next day, I left the Ravencrest pack.

When I met Jace again, the Alpha King was kissing me wildly against his office desk.

Jace stood outside the door waiting for the Alpha King's summons.

The Alpha King deliberately asked me.

"Mira, who satisfies you better-me or Jace?"

I moaned and hooked my arms around the Alpha King's neck.

"Who's Jace? Oh right, I remember you have a dog named Jace too."
