The wine glasses clinked around the dinner table, a toast to my promotion to director, but I was still busy in the kitchen.
Talia, my wife, held up my corporate card like a trophy. “I have some great news for everyone! Felix’s year-end bonus was huge—eighty thousand! We’re going to Turks and Caicos from New Year’s Day to the seventh! I booked the flights and the resort already!”
The room erupted in cheers. Scott, my eight-year-old daughter, jumped up and down. “Mommy wins! I’m going to the beach!”
I carried the final dish, a steaming stoneware pot, out of the kitchen.
Listening to Scott excitedly list all the fun she’d have by the ocean, I couldn’t help but smile.
A man works to see his family happy; their joy was more important than anything.
“That’s fantastic. I’ll start packing right after dinner and check the forecast—”
“Felix, you won’t need to pack a suit.”
Talia cut me off, her tone as casual as if she were pointing out that the soup was too salty.
My smile froze on my face. The heating pot felt searing in my hands.

“Dad, why are you just standing there? Dish me up!”
Scott tugged impatiently on my apron. I placed the pot on the trivet, the steam stinging my eyes.
Betty, my mother-in-law, stirred the stew with a ladle. “This soup is so oily. How many times do I have to say it? Gary’s cholesterol is high. Less oil, less salt.”
I ignored her, my eyes locked on Talia.
“What was that? What do you mean… I don’t have to go?”
Betty answered for her daughter, the expression on her face implying the answer was obvious. “Someone has to stay home, Felix. We have to keep an eye on the house, don’t we? And my prize orchids—they’ll be dead if they don’t get watered for a week.”
“The Petersons next door went to Cancun last month,” Gary, my father-in-law, chimed in, taking a sip of his wine. “Came back and found a pipe had burst. Whole main floor was flooded. We can’t afford a disaster like that.”
Scott’s small face wrinkled up with irritation. “Dad would just ruin the trip anyway. He’d just hover and complain about me eating ice cream or playing too close to the waves. It’s annoying.”
Talia put down her chopsticks and looked at me with an air that said, Why are you making this a problem?
“Felix, you heard them. Someone has to stay. My parents are older, and Scott is still young. You’re the only one who makes sense.”
“But I’m a part of this family, too.” My voice was shaking. “I haven’t had a vacation in eight years.”
Eight years. Talia liked to sleep in, so I got up every morning at six to make breakfast for five, take Scott to school, race to the city for my job, come home to clean, prepare special medicinal broths for my in-laws, help Scott with homework, make dinner, do the dishes, the laundry, and mop the floors.
What, exactly, did they think I was?
“Vacation?” Betty scoffed. “With what money? You think that little pittance of a paycheck you bring home is enough for a luxury trip?”
“Mom’s right,” Talia nodded. “Felix, your bonus money wasn’t exactly a windfall. If we bring you, how are we supposed to really enjoy ourselves? Besides, you just work all the time, or you’re doing chores. You wouldn't know what enjoyment is anyway. Your presence is… unnecessary.”
You just work all the time.
My hands clenched into fists.
For eight years, my corporate card and main accounts went straight to Talia. I made six figures, but I was allotted an allowance of eight hundred dollars a month. I had to watch my wife’s face just to buy a bottle of water.
I cherished my wife. I cared for my family. What had it earned me?
“Fine,” I heard myself say. “I’ll stay home.”
“I knew it.” Talia smiled with satisfaction. “You’re the backbone of this family, honey. I knew you had the strength to take one for the team.”
Backbone. That was the word I’d heard most often in eight years of marriage.
Every time they needed me to sacrifice, to concede, to endure, they used that word as the wrapper.
“Felix has such a good sense of responsibility.”
“You’re such a stand-up guy, a real man.”
I was like an ox harnessed to a plow. I’d hear the word and automatically lower my head, accepting the yoke they placed on me.
But today, I was suddenly and completely exhausted.
I turned and walked into my home office, opening a drawer and retrieving a long-forgotten document case from the bottom.
Inside were my ID from eight years ago and a deed to a property.
The deed read: Felix Lawson, Sole Owner.
The apartment had been a pre-marital gift from my mother, paid in full. Talia and her parents had no idea; they assumed it was a shared marital asset.
I took a photo of the deed, opened a messaging app, and sent it to a contact. “Get me in touch with a realtor. I want to sell this property. Close in three days, price is negotiable.”
The reply was immediate. “Understood, Felix.”
I let out a small, tired laugh. Then, I found Scott’s teacher. “Ms. Peterson, this is Felix Lawson, Scott’s father. We have a family emergency, and I won’t be able to manage Scott’s studies for a while. Moving forward, please contact her mother directly for anything concerning Scott. Thank you.”
After sending those two messages, I let out a long breath.
Then, I booked a flight.
The destination wasn’t Turks and Caicos. It was a home I hadn’t seen in eight years.

It was half-past ten when Talia finished her nightly routine and got into bed, wrapping her arms around me from behind.
“Don’t be mad. When I get back, I’ll bring you some amazing souvenirs from the islands, okay?”
I pushed her arm away. “Get away from me.”
She instantly flared up. “Felix, who are you giving that attitude to? You’re just a glorified office worker; you think you’re some big shot? Pulling this tantrum. I must have been blind to marry you. My mother always said I should have married a wealthy man, if it hadn’t been for you…”
She actually brought up the past.
Eight years ago, I was the rising star of the tech world.
I won gold in a top algorithm competition right out of college, and every major firm was fighting over me.
When I met Talia, she was a waitress. She was gentle and simple back then, nothing like the heiresses I knew or the gold-diggers who threw themselves at me.
I defied my family's wishes and insisted on being with her.
We married quickly and soon had Scott. When she wanted to move her parents into our apartment, I agreed.
She promised: “You focus on earning; we’ll take care of the home.”
To support five people, I worked myself into the ground.
But it wasn’t enough for Talia. She complained about the heavy housework, and her aging parents couldn’t handle the heavy lifting.
Betty was too stingy to hire a cleaner, so I became the designated house manager.
I morphed into a living, breathing ATM and a domestic robot.
I thought I was building a home. It turned out I was worse than an ATM.
“I’m tired, Talia.”
My voice was calm. “I have to be up at five to make breakfast, wake Scott at six, and drive you all to the airport by seven. Can you just let me sleep alone?”
My words were factual and impossible to refute. She huffed and retreated to the guest room.
“You’re just incompetent and dramatic,” she mumbled. “A man is supposed to provide for his family. You have a wife and a daughter; what more could you possibly be dissatisfied with?”
The house grew quiet. I opened my eyes in the dark.
The moonlight was bright, illuminating the bookshelf.
I remembered what my father said eight years ago: “Felix, are you certain about marrying that woman? She’s not your equal.”
I came from a major corporate dynasty, the only son. My refusal of an arranged marriage and my choice of Talia had been a tremendous disappointment to them.
I thought I could prove them wrong. The truth was, I was disastrously wrong.
Fortunately, my father had been so furious he’d cut me off completely, forbidding me from taking a penny or revealing my identity.
My mother, however, couldn’t bear it, and she secretly bought me this apartment.
She told me: “Son, if you ever hit rock bottom, remember you always have a way out.”
I thought she was being overly dramatic back then. I was such a fool.
I sat up and opened my contacts, sending a message to my father’s corporate attorney.
I stayed awake until dawn.
At five AM, I was up. By habit, I cooked the porridge, steamed the buns, fried the eggs, and warmed the milk.
At six-thirty, Scott rubbed her eyes and walked out. “Dad, where’s my blue dress?”
“Scott, I’ve told you many times, you need to lay out your clothes the night before.”
“But isn’t that what you’re supposed to do?” she asked, the entitlement absolute. “Mom said we leave at seven. Hurry up!”
I didn’t argue. I found the dress and watched her put it on.
At seven, Talia emerged with the luggage, her face radiant with excitement. “Mom, Dad, let’s go!”
Betty paused at the door to remind me. “Don’t forget to change the fish tank water, and make sure my Panda Plant gets enough sun.”
After they left, I stood in the middle of the apartment I had cleaned for eight years.
The floors gleamed, the coffee table was dust-free, and the sofa cushions were plumped and aligned.
But this wasn't my home.
It was Talia’s home, Betty and Gary’s home, Scott’s home. It was everyone’s home but mine.
I pulled out my phone and called the attorney I’d messaged last night. “Mr. Miller, is the divorce agreement ready?”
“It is, Young Master,” Frank Miller’s voice was steady. “Per your instructions: custody of the child goes to the mother, and you waive all claims to marital assets.”
“Good,” I said. “Also, please contact a deep-cleaning service for this apartment. I want every corner, every crevice, scrubbed clean. I don’t want a single trace of me left here.”
“Sir, are you really planning to…”
“I’m leaving,” I said. “And I’m not coming back to this place.”

On the way to the airport, I opened my phone and saw Talia’s post on social media. The background was the clear blue water of Turks and Caicos.
She posted a family photo—my in-laws beaming, Scott running on the beach. The caption: “Happy New Year! A family should always be complete!”
She hadn't mentioned me. I was the invisible man of the house.
I tapped the ‘like’ button. Then, I posted a photo of my own.
It was the clean, bright living room of the apartment.
The caption: “A house I protected for eight years. Starting today, I live for myself.”
I set the privacy to “Visible to Talia Reed only” and hit send.
Minutes later, her phone call came through. I rejected it. She called again. I rejected it again. On the third attempt, I blocked her.
I blocked and deleted her from every app: phone, social media, bank accounts.
I swapped out my SIM card, snapped the old one in half, and tossed it into a trash can.
Like throwing away a piece of rotten history.
As the plane lifted off, I received a text from Mr. Miller. “The realtor just showed the apartment. The buyer accepted the price on the spot.”
It was exactly what I expected. I powered down my phone and closed my eyes.
Flashes of the last eight years: Talia’s shy face when she confessed her love. Scott’s wrinkled infant face. My in-laws’ critical eyes the first time they visited. Talia’s confident vow: “I’ll manage the money for my husband.”
Then, her annoyed sigh when she handed me my allowance: “Why are you spending so much on groceries?”
Her automatic assumption when I stayed up all night to care for her sick parents: “That’s what you should be doing.”
Scott’s arrogance: “Don’t worry about my schoolwork, Dad. Mom says I just need to be pretty.”
Scene after scene, playing back like a film.
I once thought that was happiness. Now, I saw it clearly: it was a sugar coating on exploitation.
I asked myself: Though I cut myself off from my wealthy family, I never made Talia endure poverty.
I thought a wife was someone to cherish, and I took on all the tasks she didn't want.
In return, I was only met with escalating demands.
When I arrived, my parents were in the living room. My mother saw me and burst into tears.
She hugged me, crying. My father only said one thing: “It’s good that you’re home.”
That night, I logged into a tech forum I hadn't touched in eight years and posted a piece of code—an algorithm I’d worked on during the flight.
The caption: “I’m back. New Year, New Start.”
That night, I slept the most peacefully I had in eight years.
When I woke up, my phone had 99+ notifications. The code I posted had gone viral.

In Turks and Caicos, Talia was frantic because she couldn’t reach me.
I had spent eight years as a workhorse, and my social circle had shrunk to just her immediate family.
She realized she couldn’t contact me through anyone else, nor did she know where I was from.
When I married her, my parents had broken off contact and never came looking for me.
We had a bare-bones marriage, no big ceremony. Talia always assumed I had a poor relationship with my family and no safety net, so she never discovered I was the son of one of the country’s wealthiest entrepreneurs.
Betty noticed her daughter’s distraction. “What is it?”
“Mom,” Talia spat out, frustrated. “Felix might have… run away.”
“Run away?” Betty froze, then laughed. “His money is in your control, honey. Where could he possibly go? Does he have any cash? Any place to stay? He’ll be back home with his tail between his legs before we are.”
Talia considered this.
Felix had no friends or family here; he just worked and did housework. Where could he go?
Betty added, “I’ve been married long enough to know his little games. He’s just throwing a fit because he doesn’t want us to have fun. He’s making a scene.”
The more Talia thought about it, the more sense it made.
“Forget him,” she waved a hand dismissively. “We’ll be back in a week anyway. Let him sulk. We’re going to enjoy the rest of our trip.”
On the seventh day, they returned, laden with gifts and souvenirs. Talia was already planning how she’d chew me out.
Run away? He has lost his mind!
But as the taxi pulled up to the apartment, everyone froze.
A large, official-looking sign was staked on the lawn: “PROPERTY SOLD. New owner moving in shortly. Please contact the closing agent immediately.”
Talia’s suitcase fell to the pavement with a thud.
She rushed to the door and pounded on it. No answer. She fumbled for her key, put it in the lock—and it didn’t turn.
The lock had been changed.
“What… what is this?” Betty panicked. “Where’s Felix? Where is he?”
Talia’s hand shook as she pulled out her phone and dialed the number on the sign. “Hello? About this apartment…”
“Oh, you must be the previous occupants!” The agent sounded cheerful. “The seller closed on the property. You got back just in time; the new owner takes possession tomorrow. You need to vacate immediately. If you need a rental, I have a few listings…”
“Sold?” Talia interrupted. “Who sold it?”
She finally remembered. The apartment was Felix’s pre-marital asset.
“The owner of record, Mr. Felix Lawson,” the agent confirmed. “He provided all necessary documentation: deed, ID, legal waiver… everything was airtight.”
Talia’s phone slipped from her grasp.
