In my previous life, at this time, Chloe was still a pitiful little white flower. She would never have shown such an expression.

It seems things have become interesting.

"Aria, you just woke up, don't think too much. Even if you're angry with me, you need to take care of your health first."

Jake was still the same, full of verbal concern but unwilling to actually bleed when it came to money.

However, this time he doesn't get to decide.

Unlike my previous life, I've learned my lesson this time.

No crying or making a scene, only well-wishes.

So after staying in the hospital for three days, I was taken back to the family house to recuperate.

My parents only showed their faces at the beginning to express their concern, then went off to do their own things.

These past few days, I've become fully convinced that Chloe has also been reborn.

Only this time, she's too eager.

As soon as my parents left, she invited Jake and some friends over for a gathering at the house.

The pretext was to celebrate my awakening.

Everyone was standing, while I sat in a wheelchair.

"Aria hasn't fully recovered yet, so everyone please take extra care of her today," Chloe requested, acting like a caring big sister.

Seeing this, the others' eyes darted between Jake, Chloe, and me, all with a look of anticipation for drama.

And I had no intention of disappointing them.

"Jake, have you thought about what I said to you the other day?" I asked.

Hearing this, the gossip in everyone's eyes burned even more fiercely.

A flash of impatience crossed Jake's face.

"Aria, there's a limit to being willful. There are so many people here today, do you really want to make a fool of yourself?"

I sneered, "If anyone's going to look foolish, it's you."

"Three years ago, I saved your life. Otherwise, you'd be the one in a coma."

"Now you have a new love by your side, and I'm not pestering you further. I'm just asking you to pay for this life. Is that too much?"

"Three million dollars to buy three years of Mr. Jake's life - that's not too much, is it?"

The information was a bit overwhelming, and everyone couldn't help but gasp.

"Aria, how can you be so greedy? Your behavior is really unsightly," Chloe looked at me with apparent heartache. "If it were me, even if I lost my life for Jake, I would do so willingly."

Seeing her act like a holy white lotus, I felt my eyes hurt.

"Then why don't you pay the three million for him? You're willing to give up your life, so this bit of money should be nothing, right?"

Chloe was choked by my words and glared at me fiercely before quickly putting on a tearful expression again.

"Aria, I know you're doing this to embarrass me. It's my fault for not controlling my heart and falling in love with Jake. You can do whatever you want to me, but please don't hurt Jake, okay?"

As she finished speaking, Chloe's face was already covered in tears.

Anyone who didn't know better might think I was bullying her.

In fact, that's exactly what Jake thought.

He pulled Chloe behind him and looked at me with disgust, saying bluntly, "Aria, I've already made it very clear to you. I don't love you anymore, and no matter what you do, you won't attract my attention."

I sneered.

I don't understand who gave him such a big face.

"Jake, don't flatter yourself. I just want what I deserve. Or are you saying that the life of the great Mr. Jake is worthless?"

"Even ordinary families know to repay kindness. Don't tell me Mr. Jake wants to be ungrateful, forgetting the lifesaving favor of an old flame just because you have someone new?"

My voice was full of sarcasm.

The others couldn't help but whisper among themselves.

"It seems Aria is quite pitiful, saving Jake's life only to be dumped."

"Three million really isn't much. Aria is being quite civil about it. If it were me, I'd probably have torn this scumbag and his mistress apart by now."

"Chloe doesn't seem like a good person either. Look at her low-class behavior."

...

Hearing this, Jake's face turned ashen. "Aria, that's enough!"
