"If it's just about money, I'll give it to you. After this, there will be no relationship between us. Don't regret it."

I clicked my tongue twice and directly sent him my account number. "Then let everyone here be a witness. Transfer the money to me now!"

I pressed him step by step, angering Jake greatly.

He immediately called his assistant to transfer money to me.

Unfortunately, he hadn't inherited the family business yet and couldn't come up with that much money.

Looking at the one million dollars in my bank account, I clicked my tongue twice and couldn't help but mock him, "You can't even come up with three million, yet you have the nerve to two-time. I really look down on you."

"Stop talking nonsense." Chloe couldn't hold back anymore and pointed at me, cursing furiously, "At that time, the doctors had determined you wouldn't wake up. Did you expect Jake to remain celibate for you?"

I clicked my tongue twice and looked at Chloe with disdain, "Put away that hideous expression of yours. It's too ugly to look at."

Chloe's face froze, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.

That look was so ugly it hurt my eyes.

Jake hugged her lovingly and looked at me angrily, "I'll transfer the rest of the money to you tomorrow. From now on, we have no relationship whatsoever. Don't regret it."

I sneered and said without hesitation, "Whoever regrets it is a bastard."

A round of applause sounded from the crowd.

Our eyes met, and Alex was clapping while looking at me with a half-smile.

Seeing this, I pursed my lips and started to maneuver my wheelchair to leave.

But before I got far, Alex caught up with me.

"Three years in a coma and you've grown a brain?" he asked teasingly.

Hearing his mocking voice, I felt my eyes sting.

Alex, the eldest son of the Jiang family, had always been sharp-tongued and relentless since childhood.

I thought he disliked me, but it wasn't until my previous life, when I died, that I realized the truth was quite different.

After my death, I discovered that Alex was actually a softie with a hard exterior.

He ruthlessly sought revenge against my parents and Jake for my sake.

Not only did he drive them to desperation, but on my death anniversary, he went mad and crashed into them, killing them all...

Thinking of his final painful appearance, my heart ached.

"Yeah, after sleeping for three years, my brain should be fully developed," I tried to respond lightly, but by the end, I couldn't help but choke up a bit.

For all the time we had lost.

Alex pursed his lips and continued pushing me forward.

"Alex, do you need a wife?" Looking at the moonlight tonight, I asked casually, "How do you think I measure up?"

Alex looked at me seriously, "Are you serious?"

"Don't go chasing after Jake in a few days, wanting to live or die for him."

His tone carried not only arrogance but also a hint of grievance.

I couldn't help but laugh.

"Don't worry, I won't."

The next morning, looking at the marriage certificate in my hand, I was completely dazed.

I didn't expect Alex to be so eager.

Last night after our conversation, he took me back to his place, and early this morning, he took me to the registry office.

"We've already got the marriage certificate. It's too late for regrets now." Seeing me in a daze, Alex directly snatched the marriage certificate from my hand.

I smiled slightly and grinned at him, "I won't regret it!"

Before I could continue speaking, my phone suddenly rang.

"Aria, wherever you are, come back immediately!" It was my father's call.

Judging by his tone, he didn't seem to have good intentions.

"What's wrong?"

"I extorted money from Jake yesterday. My dad probably wants me to go back to face the music."

"Then let's go back. I want to see who dares to give Mrs. Jiang a hard time."

Just as we reached the living room door, I sensed an unusual atmosphere inside.

As soon as we entered, a cup shattered at my feet.
