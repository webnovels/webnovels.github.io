The day the zombie horde hit, I ripped up my assignment slip, refusing to evacuate Sector C.

I clung to life until dawn the next day, listening as Landon blared across the comms, announcing that Seraphina had found a new oasis.

Her discovery, he claimed, was humanity's last hope.

Only then did I let out a sigh of relief. As the undead tore through the door, I detonated all the explosives.

In my previous life, Landon rigged the draw, using my ‘good luck’ ability to smoothly find the oasis and become the leader.

He swore that if I succeeded, he’d dismiss his 999 lovers.

I believed him.

When I lit the signal fire, what arrived wasn’t his reinforcement, but betrayal.

“Seraphina has no powers; she needs my protection more. I just want her and her child to be respected by everyone in this apocalypse. But you, you even want to steal this small credit.”

“She got a fever from being scared by zombies while looking for you. I’ll make you feel her pain a thousandfold.”

He chained me to a car and dragged me until I was ripped apart by zombies.

When I opened my eyes again, I was back on the day the zombie horde erupted.

This time, I'd let them have their savior fantasy.
