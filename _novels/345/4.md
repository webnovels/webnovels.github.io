I spun around abruptly, seeing a kind face with a hint of surprise.

It was my university mentor, Professor Hayes.

When the news of my marriage to Liam got out, he strongly opposed it, calling me countless times, and even didn’t attend my wedding.

But I had my reasons, and I could never bring myself to tell him.

Now, he was the only elder I had left.

Looking at him, my eyes instantly welled up, my voice trembling involuntarily.

“Professor Hayes, it’s me.”

Just three short words, and my tears became uncontrollable.

All the suppressed grievances I had kept buried erupted.

“Don’t cry. The little girl who just bought your drawing was my daughter.”

“Your professor is asking, do you still want to pursue further studies?”

His gaze, just like it was back then, was full of expectation.

I nodded, tears still in my eyes.

If it weren't for what happened with Sterling Corp, I would have gone abroad with Professor Hayes and held my first art exhibition.

Professor Hayes and I went to complete the formalities, then headed to the airport to wait for our flight.

Inside the Hayes family mansion.

Liam paced restlessly in the living room.

“You still haven’t found Ellie?”

The butler shook his head.

“Find her! If you can’t find her, then keep looking!”

His voice was sharp and cold.

His eyes, usually calm and emotionless, were now filled with panic.

“Mr. Hayes, Ms. Sterling might just be out having fun. She has no friends, no family, what do you have to worry about?”

Chloe, wearing my nightgown, leaned into Liam’s arms, twisting her body, trying every trick to kiss his lips, but he pushed her away sharply.

“Get out!”

Liam’s voice was icy, his gaze fixed on Chloe as if she were a dead woman. “Who gave you permission to wear her clothes? Take it off! None of you have the right to touch her things.”

Chloe ran off, her eyes red.

He sat on the couch, stubbornly waiting.

Every tick of the second hand only amplified his frustration.

He gritted his teeth, calling my number again and again.

After countless times, the automated voice prompted him to leave a message, he let out a frustrated growl.

“Ellie, you’ve gotten brave, haven’t you? Running away from home now?”

“I’m giving you one hour. Get back here right now! Otherwise, I’m really divorcing you!”

Another hour passed.

He left me another message.

“Ellie, if you don’t come back, even if you cry and beg me, I’m still divorcing you!”

By the third message, his voice was starting to sound frantic.

“Are you deliberately trying to see if I care about you? Just come back! Is it money you want? As long as you come back, I’ll give you whatever you need.”

“Ellie, you’re the one who wronged me, why are you throwing a tantrum?!”

“Just come back, say you love me, and I’ll let it go.”

“Why don’t you care about all those other women but you can’t tolerate Chloe? I already sent her away, so come back quickly, don’t be so ungrateful!”

He waited for a day and a night, calling me countless times, but he never received any news from me.
