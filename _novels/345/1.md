The moment I signed the divorce papers, the smug triumph on Liam’s face instantly froze.

He snatched the signed agreement, his eyes bloodshot, his fingers tightening around my throat, nearly insane. “Ellie! What new game are you playing now?!”

“Don’t forget, you *begged* your way into my bed! You’d stop at nothing to marry me!”

“What? Now you’re putting on a show of purity? Debasing yourself like that was all for money, wasn’t it?!”

Each word was uglier than the last.

For three years, he’d repeatedly brought up these things, constantly humiliating me.

As if he was afraid I’d forget that it was I, Eleanor Sterling, who was shameless enough to slink into Liam’s bed.

I would always cry and deny it.

For three years, every day, I’d explain myself to him, believing that one day, he’d finally see my true feelings.

But now, my heart was utterly dead. Whether he believed me or not no longer mattered.

Watching him rage, his voice hoarse, I only felt an overwhelming weariness.

That crushing weight, so deep it felt like it was in my very bones, made me think death wouldn’t be so bad.

“Ellie! Say something! How dare you look at me like that! You’re the one who wronged me!”

Liam’s furious shouting finally died down.

After he had calmed slightly, I slowly raised my head. “Are you done talking?”

“If you’re done, can I leave?”

For the first time in three years, I felt this calm.

Liam, however, panicked. He scoffed, trying to hide the fleeting alarm in his eyes.

“Leave? Where do you plan on going?”

“You want to leave? Fine. Every single thing on you, isn't it all *my* money? You want to leave? Fine. Go back the way you came – with nothing!”

He stood there, looking down at me, and through him, I somehow saw the Liam of my youth.

Back then, he was so afraid I’d leave him, he’d pull me close every day, just begging me to say I loved him.

But all of that had long since vanished with the wind.

Now, standing before him, I only felt the utter humiliation of being stripped bare and shoved into his bed.

Looking at his eyes, practically screaming “beg me,” I forced a smile. “Alright.”

I took off the watch from my wrist.

He’d threatened me this way countless times.

Each time, I would cry and plead with him, begging him not to humiliate me like this, for the sake of our past.

Back then, I still had hope for him and for our future.

But now.

Living was more torturous than dying.

These humiliations were just icing on the cake of my suffering.

It hurt, but it didn't matter.

I took off the last jacket he’d given me, then removed the wedding ring he’d bought. I stared at him, then let go of my fingers.

The wedding ring clattered to the floor, a sharp, clear sound.

Something I once cherished above all else now felt no different from a cold stone.

I didn’t look back at his trembling form. Barefoot, I walked step by step toward the door.

“Ellie! Are you insane?! Stop right there!”

Liam’s furious roar echoed behind me.

But the bruises marring my thin body – a canvas of black and blue – became the ultimate mockery of him.

I walked faster and faster, heading toward the sunlight, leaving him completely behind.

Watching my retreating figure, Liam, whether from rage or grief, trembled violently and collapsed onto the floor, gasping for air.

“Mr. Hayes, Ms. Sterling is just being so ungrateful. She’s throwing such a tantrum just because you didn’t answer her call. Does she have someone else?” Chloe’s words were laced with insinuation.

Liam suddenly pushed her away, his eyes blazing red. “Get out!”

“Mr. Jenkins, take her clothes to her. How dare she leave? How dare she walk out on me!”

“Ellie, you were the one who wronged me first!”
