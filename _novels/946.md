There was a torrential downpour in Duskvale.

Aurora had waited in the villa for a long time, but there was still no sign of the three men returning. It was Sunday—their shared day. In the past, the three had never missed it. But today, even after the dishes on the table had gone completely cold, no one showed up.

Suddenly, Aurora received a call from one of the three men's mutual friends to go to a clubhouse.

When she arrived, she discovered that Taylor Quinn, Stellan Croft, and Flynn Simpson were all standing in front of a table with similarly displeased expressions. The atmosphere between them was tense. On the table, there was a painting.

Aurora looked down and saw the artist's name—Danica Sauter. She instantly understood how the tension that was simmering between the three men came about.

Danica was now a renowned painter known for her artistic skill and beauty. More importantly, she was the unrequited true love of these three prominent figures in Duskvale's elite circle.

"Aurora is here. I suggest the three of you stop arguing and let her decide, okay?" a young man suggested, glancing at the three stubborn men.

He then shot a mischievous look at Aurora, whose face bore a striking resemblance to Danica's.

The young man pushed Aurora forward to mediate. He said, "They've been arguing over this painting for a while now. The price has already been pushed to the limit, and they still can't agree on who will have it. Since you look like Danica, why don't you decide who gets the painting?"

Everyone could tell he was throwing the hot potato at Aurora. She was merely a substitute the three of them kept around for fun. How could she have any say in the matter?

Tentatively, Aurora looked at the three men who were now seated on the couch.

Taylor was cold and indifferent. Stellan was harsh and aloof. Flynn was obsessive and ruthless. No matter who Aurora chose, the other two would no doubt torment her to the extent that she wished she was dead.

Aurora's palms were sweating. Finally, when everyone started to grow impatient, she suddenly reached out and picked up the painting.

She suggested, "Why don't we keep the painting at my place? That way, no matter who comes to see me, they'll be able to see it."

Her answer seemed like a try-hard attempt to smooth things over and avoid offending anyone. Even so, it was the most acceptable option for them.

Sure enough, while the three men's expressions remained impassive, at least they no longer looked like they were about to break out into a fistfight.

The young men who had been waiting to see the drama unfold were disappointed. They couldn't help but be amazed by Aurora's ability to skillfully navigate between the three powerful men. She had some tricks up her sleeves, after all.

The three didn't say anything. They simply exchanged cold smiles and accepted the solution Aurora proposed. With the issue settled, everyone left the auction hall and went to a private room to drink.

Aurora quietly trailed behind them.

It had been three years since she'd met Taylor, Stellan, and Flynn. The three of them were well-known within Duskvale's elite circle.

Back then, she was working in a bar when all three of them noticed her at once. They didn't fall in love with her at first sight. The only reason they were interested in her was because her face bore an uncanny resemblance to their unrequited love interest.

Later, Aurora learned that their shared crush was named Danica.

Danica had grown up alongside Taylor, Stellan, and Flynn. They were all childhood friends. She was the little princess of Duskvale's elite circle. All three of them had a crush on her, but she never reciprocated anyone's feelings. A few years ago, she even left the country for her career.

During the days when they couldn't see the person they loved, they were unable to dispel their longing until they met Aurora. When they saw Aurora's face, which looked so much like Danica's, they came up with the idea of using her as a stand-in.

At first, each of the three men wanted to claim Aurora for himself. But since there was only one of her, none of them were willing to give in. In the end, they decided to share her. They each paid her one million dollars to be Danica's stand-in.

Her Mondays and Tuesdays belonged to Taylor. Wednesdays and Thursdays were reserved for Stellan, and Fridays and Saturdays were Flynn's. On Sundays, they shared Aurora.

This arrangement was the talk of Duskvale's elite circle for a long time.

Back in the private room, the three men's attention had shifted from the painting. Beside them, Aurora silently poured them drinks.

Flynn glanced up inadvertently and noticed that Aurora was wearing a pale yellow dress that day. He frowned slightly and ordered, "Go get changed. Dani never wore this color."

For the past three years, Aurora had complied with all their requests. Whenever any of them thought she was unlike Danica in any way, she would immediately change as if she were afraid that they would abandon her.

Everyone talked behind her back and gossiped that she was willing to give up her dignity for three million dollars.

As expected, Aurora immediately replied, "I'm sorry. I'll get changed right away."

She ran out and borrowed a white dress from a female server. Then, she changed into it.

When she returned and was about to push open the door, she overheard them talking about her inside.

"Mr. Quinn, Mr. Croft, and Mr. Simpson, you've found many stand-ins for Danica over the years. But you've kept Aurora around for quite some time. Don't tell me you've developed feelings for her?" a young man asked teasingly, eliciting laughter from the people in the room.

Several derisive laughs sounded soon after.

Taylor, holding his wine glass, said with a smirk, "Would you throw away the most obedient dog at your disposal?"

Stellan's expression remained indifferent as he replied, "She's just someone we keep around to pass the time. There's no way there are any feelings involved."

Flynn took a casual sip of his drink and spoke up too. "I haven't gotten bored of her yet. When I am, I'll discard her like trash."

From the way they spoke, it could be seen that they didn't even regard Aurora as a person.

But when Aurora heard these words, her expression remained unchanged. She even waited until they finished speaking before pushing the door open and walking in.
