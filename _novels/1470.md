My husband has a strange hereditary illness.

Every six months after we got married, he would lose his memory for fifteen days.

And during those fifteen days, hed fall madly, passionately in love with another woman.

The first time Hymen lost his memory, he fell for my arch-nemesis. 

For her sake, he had me kidnapped while I was at work, costing me a major promotion.

The second time he lost his memory, he fell for the housemaid. 

For her sake, he framed me in a compromising situation, filmed it, and then blasted it all over social media to publicly humiliate me.

The third time, he fell for my adopted sister. For her sake, he forced me to abort our child, almost killing both me and the baby.

Each time he regained his memory, he would kneel and beg for my forgiveness, and then brutally punish his mistresses.

The last time, he fell for my best friend.

I let out a weary sigh.

"Hymen Hayes, if youre sick, cant you just drop dead already?"


"Liya, I know youre hurting, but you cant force love."

Hymen responded helplessly.

"Hymen loves me. You need to accept that reality instead of cursing your own husband to die."

Serena draped herself over Hymen, purring.

I took a deep breath. Today marked the first day of his latest amnesiac episode.

"If you run out of condoms, there are more in the second drawer. Oh, and Serena, did you buy accident insurance?"

The last part I said in a loaded tone.

Serena froze, staring at me like I was a lunatic, a smirk twisting her lips.

"Liya, have you gone mad with grief? Over a man, really?"

This was the same best friend who used to be furious and ready to defend me every time Hymen cheated.

Now, she looked like a smug victor.

I simply pursed my lips, a nonchalant shrug.

"Its nothing, just a friendly warning. Good luck in fifteen days."

With that, I turned and walked away.

Wanton moans echoed from the master bedroom that was once ours.

Hymen chuckled, his breathing still ragged.

"Liya Hayes is just a pawn in a business marriage. Why bother getting upset with her? My heart belongs only to you."

Heh, this Hayes family illness was truly something.

Every time he lost his memory, hed dismiss me as a mere tool, always finding a way to justify his own messed-up logic.

Stepping out of the villa.

I called my lawyer directly, calmly giving my instructions.

"By any means necessary, at any cost, within fifteen days, I want to see my divorce papers with Hymen Hayes!"

And as the at-fault party, he would walk away with nothing but the clothes on his back!

Of course, an even grander surprise awaited Hymen, for him to personally appreciate once his memory returned.

The apartment door violently crashed open.

Hymen stormed in, and with one swift move, slapped me across the face.

My cheek throbbed with a numb, tingling sensation, my lip was split, a thin line of blood oozing.

"Hymen, you hit me... for Serena?"

I crumpled to the floor, utterly defeated.

Not a single tear would fall, yet I still feigned an expression of unbearable agony.

In the corner, the red light of a hidden camera blinked steadily.

He scoffed.

"Still so desperately in love with me? Liya Hayes, you truly are pitiful!"

Before he could finish, he gestured.

His bodyguards understood, immediately stepping forward to shove me to the ground, roughly and cruelly.

"But kidnapping Serena? That crossed a line. Do it! Teach Liya a lesson. Dont stop until she tells us where Serena is."

Fists rained down on me.

Suddenly, Hymens phone vibrated.

He barely glanced at the caller ID before snatching it up, a surge of excitement on his face.

"Serena? Im coming right away. Dont be scared, dont cry, it would break my heart."

He hurried away.

In the empty apartment, only I remained, a pathetic heap on the ground, as I pulled out my phone.

The video was syncing in real-time to the cloud.

I edited, saved.

Note: 

[Gift 1 for the ex-husband, in fifteen days!]

Serenas elaborate act had gone off without a hitch.

To further punish me, Hymen froze all my credit cards and even notified the TV network, suspending me from my job indefinitely.

Ms. Hayes, the head of the TV department, offered a strained smile, trying to comfort me.

"Liya, Mr. Hayes will regain his memory in fifteen days anyway. After all these years, you two have been through so much. He truly loves you; everyone can see that."

I was utterly drained, clutching the suspension notice as I left.

As soon as I stepped out of the TV network building.

Serenas SnapChat messages came flooding in, one after another.

[Liya Hayes, as your best friend, I was always just a mere backdrop for you to compare yourself against.]

[But now, its different. The man you love most belongs to me.]

[I, Serena, will soon step over you and claim all your wealth and happiness.]

[Jealous? Resentful? But no! Hahahaha...]

The contemptuous words, the utterly arrogant tone practically jumped off the screen.

I scoffed, then took a screenshot.
