I went against my family's objections and married the chauffeur's son.

Three years into our marriage, I helped Jude rise to the position of the company's second-in-command.

"Honey, this appointment ceremony is all thanks to you. I'll love you forever."

He endured harsh trials to marry me, kneeling in the pouring rain for three days and nights, silently enduring my father's wrath, and shielding me in a car accident, nearly at the cost of his own life.

After marriage, he treated me with endless care, just as he always had. I never regretted marrying him.

The night before the promotion ceremony, I wanted to surprise him with the news that my father had agreed to give him shares.

But I overheard intimate whispers from the study door!

Through the crack, I saw it was Cora, the illegitimate daughter, with my husband!

"Baby, after tomorrow, the company will be ours. I've waited for this day for so long."

"If you hadn't endured so much to marry Nora, we wouldn't have what we do today. You've worked hard, my dear."

I was in shock, overwhelmed with pain. I couldn't believe the man I loved was so deceitful!

The next day, I personally handed the promotion gift to Jude, and he was stunned on the spot!
