Nancy slept alone all night, and Ryan still hadn't returned by noon the next day.

When she woke up, it was still raining outside.

Nancy stayed at home all day, calmly deleting all the posts about her married life on social media platforms.

Just as she finished cleaning up, she saw Fiona, who had threatened to die yesterday, suddenly post on social media:

"What's it like to be pampered by your ex-boyfriend?"

She included a grid of nine photos.

In the first, the usually cold and indifferent Ryan was feeding her porridge.

In the second, the normally aloof Ryan was sitting by her bedside, holding her hand tightly.

In the third, the usually arrogant Ryan was kneeling before her, helping her take medicine with eyes full of distress.

The fourth was a photo of a pile of luxury goods, each worth at least tens of millions. Fiona had written on it, "Thanks to Ryan's connections, I'm not angry or upset anymore."

The beautiful woman in the photos smiled sweetly, looking like the happiest princess on a phone call.

Many people in the comments section were extremely envious and posted sour remarks.

"Left and experienced hardships, returned and still true love. Fiona, did you save the galaxy in your past life?"

"Nonsense! This must be at least ten galaxies. Fiona, how did you do it? How can you make your ex still so devoted?"

Besides the envy, there were naturally those who wanted to mock Nancy.

Nancy just glanced over casually, and a few people's comments caught her eye.

"I wonder what Miss Xu would think if she saw this?"

"What could a substitute think? Did she really think that by going up to save face and be the bride, she could truly win the heart of the great Mr. Sullivan? She's probably dying of jealousy seeing this. How long do you bet before this lapdog shows up?"

"I bet 10 minutes!"

"I bet 5 minutes!"

"I bet 1 minute! She's probably already downstairs. I'll bet my new Lamborghini!"

Many people followed along excitedly, with the stakes getting higher and higher.

But Nancy just smiled resignedly and quickly typed out a few words on her phone:

"I bet she'll never show up in her lifetime."

Her words stirred up a storm, with many people immediately messaging to ask if she was joking.

Nancy simply turned off her phone and stopped looking at any messages.

Instead, she turned to make herself a bowl of noodles.

At that moment, her phone suddenly rang.

Nancy didn't answer, but the phone kept ringing incessantly for five or six minutes before finally stopping.

But soon after, the housekeeper Mrs. Zhang came in looking troubled, holding her own phone.

"Ma'am, the master wants you to answer the phone."

Only then did Nancy pick up the phone and answer.

"Nancy, it's all a misunderstanding. I've already had Fiona delete the post. Don't overthink it. She wasn't feeling well yesterday, that's why I didn't come back. Nothing happened between us."

Ryan's anxious voice came through the phone. The moment he saw Nancy's comment, he had panicked.

Nancy looked at the noodles she had made and calmly said, "I made noodles. Are you coming back to eat?"

Ryan was stunned on the other end before replying, "I'm glad you're not angry. You can eat the noodles yourself. Fiona's heart is hurting again, so I'm taking her to the hospital. Don't worry, we're really just frie-"

Before he could finish, Fiona's anxious voice came through from the other end.

"Ryan, where are you? I can't see you. Did I lose you again? My heart feels so uneasy."

The call was hurriedly hung up, leaving only Ryan's very anxious voice to the other person.

"Fiona, I'm here. You didn't lose me."

Looking at the disconnected call, Nancy sent Ryan a message: "That document you asked about yesterday is in the glove compartment of your passenger seat."

"You can open it and see what it is."

It wasn't until two hours later that Ryan finally replied with one sentence.

"No need. Whatever you had me sign, I'm sure it's not to harm me."

This meant he wouldn't look at it.

Yes, right now he just wanted to be by Fiona's side. Why would he look at anything unrelated to Fiona?

Even if that divorce agreement was right at his fingertips.

In the afternoon, Nancy drove with a truck delivering supplies to the orphanage where she grew up.

Nancy had been an orphan since childhood and grew up here.

The children were very happy to see Nancy come, and all ran up to cling to her and share their experiences.

After spending time with the children, she went to the director's office to say goodbye.

"Mom, I'm going abroad for further studies."

The director was very happy. Nancy had been a top student in physics at Tsinghua University, but had suddenly given up going abroad to get married. The director had regretted it for a long time.

"Nancy, that's wonderful." The director held Nancy's hand, smiling with satisfaction. But then she thought of something and looked worried, "But... you going abroad for further studies, doesn't that mean you and Ryan will be in a long-distance relationship? Long-distance relationships are very difficult."

Nancy looked out the window at a few children playing and running, shaking her head with a light smile.

"It's not a long-distance relationship. I divorced him."

"Because... Fiona came back."

The director was stunned for a moment, then let out a long sigh, feeling both regretful and relieved.

"Sure enough, I wasn't wrong in my initial assessment. Your marriage couldn't last long. You know, once a person still has someone else in their heart, no matter how loving they seem on the surface, it's all fake. As soon as that person comes back, the marriage is over! So it's good that you divorced."

She held Nancy's hand gently, comforting her softly.

Nancy smiled back and hugged the director. Yes, it was good that they divorced.
