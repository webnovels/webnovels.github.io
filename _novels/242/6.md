Another day passed. There was one day left before the divorce cooling-off period ended, and Nancy would receive the divorce certificate.

Thinking that she could finally leave, she began mailing her luggage abroad.

Halfway through packing, Ryan called from the company, asking her to attend a banquet at the Sullivan family mansion.

Nancy wanted to refuse, because in one more day, their legal marriage would be dissolved. But thinking of how Mrs. Sullivan had taken care of her all these years,

Plus, it was the last day after all. Nancy wanted to find an opportunity to be alone with Ryan and explain things clearly.

Although it was a hasty marriage, Nancy wanted to end it with clarity.

In the bustling Sullivan family estate, lights were shining brightly everywhere, with socialites gathered, clinking glasses.

But as soon as she went in, Nancy didn't see Ryan. After asking around, she learned from an old Sullivan family servant that Ryan was in a house on the north side.

Nancy immediately walked in that direction.

The door of the house was slightly ajar, with some suggestive sounds coming from inside.

Nancy suddenly felt a wave of unease. Her body trembling, she slowly peeked through the door crack.

Immediately, a shocking scene entered her eyes.

On the sofa, Ryan was roughly and urgently undressing Fiona's evening gown while pinning her tightly to the couch.

His large hands gripped Fiona's waist as he trailed kisses from her collarbone downwards.

Fiona arched her head to meet Ryan, saying passionately,

"Ryan! Promise me you won't leave me."

Fiona whispered. Ryan suddenly pushed her away forcefully.

"Fiona! Are you crazy?! I'm married! Why have you come back now? What exactly do you take me for? Something you can throw away and pick up again as you please? Do you know how afraid I am of being alone again?!"

Ryan was very angry, but Fiona wouldn't listen. She stubbornly moved forward to hug his waist again, their bodies pressed together.

"Ryan! I was wrong!"

"Fiona! Get out!"

Again and again, endlessly.

Finally, Ryan gave in and surrendered. This time he didn't let Fiona come hug him.

He forcefully pulled Fiona close and bit down hard on her lips, then their mouths entangled, inseparable.

Several moments later, the two finally moments later, the two finally parted.

Fiona wiped the blood from the corner of her mouth and smiled smugly, then hooked Ryan's chin.

"So, do you still love me?"

Nancy watched from outside, feeling as if countless knives were stabbing her heart over and over.

Ryan stood frozen in place. After a moment, he looked up at her with eyes full of restrained love, his tone one of surrender.

The next moment, his red lips moved: "I do!"

At this, Fiona's eyes were full of triumph. She kissed him again, then asked,

"So, are you willing to divorce that Nancy Xu and marry me?"

Ryan's whole body suddenly stiffened.

Abruptly, he remembered that wedding from years ago that he couldn't bear to recall, remembered the figure who resolutely stood up and walked firmly to his side amidst a crowd of strange looks.

"...I."

Ryan turned his head, about to answer.

But at that instant, he saw a pair of eyes full of sorrow watching him through the slowly opening door.

All of a sudden, darkness appeared in Ryan's mind.

Nancy stood outside, calmly looking at him, tears streaming down her face.

"—Nancy!"
