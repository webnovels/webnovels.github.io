Ryan hurried over.

His gaze fell on Fiona, who was standing there fine, and he seemed to breathe a sigh of relief before turning to speak to Nancy on the other side.

"Nancy, Fiona's house hasn't been lived in for many years and needs to be renovated, so can she stay with us for a few days during this time?"

Nancy looked at Ryan without speaking.

In the silence, Fiona's expression became full of unease and a bit of grievance. "Ryan, maybe I should just leave. After all, it's my fault for not showing up at the wedding. Now you have a new wife, and it seems Miss Xu doesn't welcome me."

Ryan looked at Nancy, his face hesitating for a moment.

Fiona let out a long sigh, her expression dejected as she turned to leave.

Sophie immediately reached out to stop her. "Sister Fiona! Why are you leaving?! If anyone should leave, it's her. The real mistress of this villa should be..."

"Shut up! Sophie!"

Ryan glared at her angrily and shouted, "Who told you to talk to Nancy like that? She's my wife, your sister-in-law. Apologize to her right now, or get out!"

Sophie's eyes immediately turned red. Seeing this scene, Nancy finally spoke up, the corners of her mouth curling into a smile.

"It's fine, you don't need to scold Sophie. I didn't say I wouldn't agree. Miss Quinn, please stay here."

With that, Nancy turned and walked into the villa.

This was the eighth year she had loved Ryan.

She still remembered the first time she saw him on the basketball court and fell in love at first sight.

Ryan didn't know.

Until later, when Nancy, as an orphan, saw Ryan red-eyed and at a loss standing at the altar during the wedding, she instinctively went up.

That heart had nothing to do with status or interests. She just didn't want to see the person she liked cry.

Seemingly afraid Fiona would still leave, Ryan immediately instructed the servants to move her luggage into the largest guest room.

Sophie immediately walked smugly in front of Nancy, her nose in the air: "What are you standing here for? Go make dinner. Oh, and Sister Fiona can't eat spicy food, so make it bland."

Hearing this, Fiona's eyes gleamed with satisfaction as she looked Nancy up and down again.

"I've always heard that Miss Xu's cooking skills are quite good. So today..."

Before she could finish, Ryan came down from the guest room upstairs: "Sophie, that's enough! How many times have I told you, we have servants in the house. Why do you always make Nancy cook for you?"

Fiona's face fell, and the glance she cast at Nancy was full of jealousy and hatred.

But when Ryan walked over, Fiona immediately changed her expression and smiled.

"I'll cook today. I've learned a lot of skills abroad these past few years and have always wanted to make something for you all to try."

As she said this, Fiona was looking at Ryan.

Ryan's eyes suddenly had a moment of daze, but when he saw Nancy standing quietly to the side, he still shook his head and said, "No need, your health isn't good either. Just let the serv-"

Sophie clung to him, grabbing Ryan's hand and saying, "Brother, just let Sister Fiona cook. She worked so hard to learn."

Ryan seemed to think of something and finally nodded.

"Alright, but don't tire yourself out."

Nancy watched all of this without saying a word, just standing by the floor-to-ceiling window looking out at the garden.

Ryan looked at Nancy standing so quietly and suddenly felt more and more uneasy.

After a long silence, he walked to Nancy's side, his red lips moving slightly.

"Nancy, if you don't like Fiona staying here, I'll send her back after we finish this meal."

"No need. Let her stay if she wants."

Nancy turned to look at Ryan: "That document, have you looked at it?"

Mentioning the document again, Ryan frowned slightly: "I haven't looked yet. Didn't I say I trust you? Do I really need to look at it?"

Does he need to or not? Nancy didn't know.

The signature was already there anyway, but thinking of their three years living together day and night.

Nancy was about to speak when Fiona suddenly brought over a pot of hot soup. She glanced at Nancy standing beside Ryan like a stranger, her eyes flashing with intense jealousy.

Then, she pretended to lose her grip and not hold the pot steady, rushing forward towards Nancy in a panic, spilling the entire pot of hot soup.

"Watch out!"
