“Mom, the cake is beautiful! I’m sure Daddy will love it.” Luna beamed at me as I placed the last candle on top.
“Let’s hope that he will like it.” We heard Will’s car park in the driveway. 
“That’s daddy! Should we surprise him?” Luna asked, and I nodded. 
“Yes, let me light this candle first.” 
Luna and I walked to the front door to surprise Will while bringing the cake. I can feel Luna’s excitement cause every year, we always surprise him on his birthday and he enjoys it.
The front door creaked open. “Surprise! Happy Birthday, Dad.” 
“What is the meaning of this?!” 
“It’s your birthday,” I said. 
“Do you like it, Dad?” Luna asked beside me.
Will frowned. “No, I hate it.” 
“Will, can you help me with this suitcase?” 
A woman came strutting in as if she owns the place. Beside her is a little girl which I assume it’s her daughter. 
“How lovely a cake. Is this for my welcoming party?” 
Who is she?
“Ah… you must be Anna. Will told me all about you. I thank you once again for letting my daughter and me stay here. Will told me you are okay with it.”
Will told me. He never told me. He never even asked me about this matter.
“I don’t know if you remember me, but I’m Charlotte. Will’s ex-girlfriend before he marries you?” 
I froze. Am I hearing this right?
“I-what?”
Will sighed and took her suitcase. “Charlotte will be staying here for a while.” 
He didn’t even look at me as he walked up the stairs with her suitcase. 
“Evelyn, introduce yourself to Aunt Anna.” 
The little girl beamed brightly. “Hello, miss, my name is Evelyn.” 
I forced a smile. “Hello, I’m Anna. It seems that Luna will not be alone from now on.” 
Her daughter ran into the living room, laughing. “This house is huge! Mommy, look!”
Charlotte looked around like she belonged there. “Will always had good taste.”
Luna tugged on my dress, and I crouched down. “Mom, who are they?”
“They are Dad’s friends.”
“Are they going to live here?” 
I nodded. “Yes, and I want you to treat them kindly, ok, dear?”
Luna nodded, her pigtail bouncing up and down. “Did Dad like our surprise? He doesn’t look excited.”
“I’m sure he will like it. I’ll go give this cake to him.”
I headed to our room, waiting for Will to come, and when he did, I came up to him. 
“Who is that woman? And why did you bring her here?” I asked with curiosity in my tone.
“She has been through a lot, and she needed help.” He answers casually if this conversation doesn’t mean anything to him.
I frowned, staring at him. “She has her family. Why you?”
Will sighed tiredly as he stared me straight in the eye. “I’m not in the mood to talk about this. Just accept that Charlotte and Evelyn will be staying here, and I expect you to treat them kindly, Anna.”
“Luna and I made this for you,” I said to him softly, still holding the cake. 
“I don’t need a cake.” He walked past me and accidentally bumped me, causing the cake to fall flat on the floor.
“The cake…” I mumbled. 
It hurt me to see the cake Luna and I had made ruined.
I clean up the mess and head down to the kitchen.
“Mom, where’s the cake?” Luna asked as she peeked into the kitchen.
I turned my back so she wouldn’t see the ruined cake.
“It fell, sweetie,” I said. “We’ll make another one.”
“But… we worked so hard on it,” her voice cracked.
“I know,” I whispered. “It’s okay.”
Charlotte entered the kitchen looking like she had just had a good nap.
“Everything alright here?” she asked.
Luna stepped behind me.
I didn’t answer.
Charlotte came closer, heels clicking.
“Oh… the cake.” She paused, then smiled. “Maybe it was too sweet anyway.”
I clenched my jaw.
Will came down behind her, adjusting his tie.
“Are we doing breakfast or what?”
I looked at him. “You’re not going to say anything about the cake? Luna made it for you.”
“It’s not a big deal,” he said while shrugging.
Luna tugged on my sleeve. “Mom, can we eat now?”
Charlotte sat down at the table like it belonged to her.
“Evelyn, come eat!” she called out.
Her daughter skipped into the dining room. “Can I sit next to Uncle Will?”
Will nodded. “Of course.”
Luna pulled out her usual chair beside him.
But Evelyn got there first.
Will didn’t notice.
Or maybe he did.
He just didn’t care.
Later that day, Charlotte stood in the garden holding a cup of tea.
I joined her because I had to.
“Nice weather,” she said.
I nodded. “Yes.”
She glanced at me. “You know, Will and I used to have a garden like this.”
I stayed silent.
She kept going. “He used to say roses reminded him of me.”
I forced a smile. “That’s lovely.”
“He used to write me letters. Real ones. With poems. Did he ever write you one?” she asked as she drank her tea.
I didn’t know Will could write poetry.
He never wrote me anything.
I force a smile. “I didn’t know he could write. Good for you, Charlotte.” I act as if it doesn’t affect me, even though it slightly bothers me.
She laughed after, like it was some kind of a joke.
But it didn’t feel like one.
She’d tell me about their past like it was some tragic love story and imply that I was in the way of their relationship. 
Charlotte tilted her head. “I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable, Anna.”
“I don’t.”
She smiled again. “Good. Because I’m only here for Evelyn.”
“I hope you both settle in well.”
“Will’s always been protective. Especially for people he cares about.”
I turned to leave.
She called after me, “You’re not misunderstanding us, right?”
I stopped.
“No.”
