When I took the kids for their routine pre-school check-up, I unexpectedly found out that my stepson, Liam, had leukemia.

I immediately contacted the bank, desperate to get a loan for a bone marrow transplant.

But my daughter, Bella, suddenly piped up, “Dad, when we go in, just say *I* have leukemia.”

The moment we walked through the door, Bella dropped to her knees in front of my wife, tears streaming down her face. “Mom, I want to live. Please, save me.”

I knew this was Bella’s test, and my eyes were glued to Eleanor’s reaction.

If she said *anything* about treating Bella, I’d sell everything I owned to cure Liam.

But if Eleanor couldn’t stand by me through this hardship, then I’d have no choice but to watch Liam’s illness with cold indifference.
