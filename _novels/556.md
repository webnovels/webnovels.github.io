My girlfriend became an A-list actress. The very first night she hit the big time, she stabbed me seventeen times. I bled out and died.

But after killing me, she took her own life.

In her hand, as she died, was a voice recorder. Engraved on it: "To Liam."

Inside, it was filled with a raw, agonizing mix of adoration and longing.

Liam was her idealized crush, the one she'd yearned for three years. He'd died in a car accident before she ever got the chance to confess her feelings.

On the recording, she sobbed, her voice tearing through her, "It’s all because of you! You made me lose my love!"

When I opened my eyes again, I watched her run toward the surging traffic. I didn’t stop her. Instead, I poured every ounce of my being into saving *her* love.

Seeing her hold him close, like she’d found the most precious treasure, I let out a bitter, mocking smile.

This time, Chloe, I set you free.

Just don't come crawling back.
