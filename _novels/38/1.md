"What?" Jake seemed not to understand and asked me again.

I smiled slightly, "Three years ago, I saved your life. Otherwise, you'd be the one lying here."

"Three years of time, plus your life - name a price and pay me back!"

Jake was stunned for a while, then said coldly, "I know you resent me, but why degrade yourself like this?"

I laughed coldly, "What do you mean by degrading myself?"

"I saved your life back then. Are you trying to brush off these three years so lightly?"

Jake pursed his lips and shamelessly said, "We were in love at that time. I remember all the good things you did for me."

Seeing him like this, I couldn't help but laugh.

What a dog!

He's trying to avoid paying.

No matter how many times I relive this, he's always so infuriating.

In my previous life, I had just woken up when I heard from Jake about how he and Chloe fell in love at first sight.

At that time, my memories were still stuck three years ago, when our love was at its peak.

We were traveling together, and Jake carelessly didn't watch where he was going and was about to be hit by a car.

I was blinded by love and pushed him away, ending up in a coma myself.

Three years had passed, and everything had changed.

I couldn't accept that I had risked my life for Jake, only for him to find a new love during these three years.

I cried and made a scene, acting hysterically like a madwoman.

As a result, they became increasingly impatient with me.

On the day I was discharged from the hospital, it happened to be Jake's engagement day.

I rushed to their engagement ceremony and caused a huge scene.

Everyone thought I had gone mad, including my parents.

They had security throw me out.

Ironically, as soon as I left the ceremony venue, I was hit by a car and died.

Laughably, the car was carrying the 999 roses Jake had ordered for Chloe.

After my death, Jake and Chloe had no more obstacles and lived happily together.

My parents acted as if they never had a daughter like me, doting on Chloe as if she were their own.

This time, I no longer yearn for their attention. I want to live well for myself.

Of course, before that, I need to take back what belongs to me.

"Jake, spare me your bullshit about feelings. If you really had feelings for me, you wouldn't have a new love."

"Three million dollars to buy your life - that's not too much, is it?"

"Or I could post this story online and let everyone judge for themselves whether I'm being unreasonable or if you, Mr. Jake, are being heartless and ungrateful!"

I said the last four words slowly, successfully making Jake's face turn blue with anger.

Three years ago, I was a genius girl, admitted to a top university without exams.

Jake could never compensate for my three years.

Jake thought he had me under his thumb, that I wouldn't dare to disobey him.

Even if I was cheated on, I would have to swallow my pride.

But I'm determined to shame him.

"Aria, I know you can't accept this for now, but don't worry, we'll still be the best of friends in the future, just with one more person to care for you."

"Chloe is a great person. She and I will take good care of you from now on."

Jake's shamelessness left me speechless.

Before I could speak, the hospital room door was pushed open.

"Aria, you're finally awake!" Chloe exclaimed, her eyes red with apparent emotion as our gazes met.

I have to admit, she's really good at acting.

"Yes, if I hadn't woken up, my home would have been stolen completely," I replied.

Hearing this, Chloe immediately explained, "That's not true. I never intended to compete with you for anything."

Still putting on airs like a cheap actress.

So low-class.

I smiled slightly and said coldly, "It's fine. If you've taken it, you've taken it. I don't care anyway."

"As long as Jake gives me what I deserve, I wish you both happiness."

After I spoke, Chloe looked at me in disbelief. "You... you're... not making a fuss anymore?" The last part she said very quietly.

But because all my attention was on her, I still heard it.

Thinking of a possibility, I couldn't help but smile.

It seems she has also relived this once.

I pretended not to understand and asked, "Jake said you're about to get engaged. What's the use of me making a fuss?"

I stared at Chloe without blinking, and a flash of smugness crossed her face.

Indeed, things are different from my previous life.
