Emily Caldwell had thought she finally had William Silverstein back, and that her life could at last settle into something close to peace. Everything held steady until Aria Rayburn's wedding.

Without a moment's hesitation, William had shown up and wrecked the entire ceremony.

Not long after, Emily received a ten-minute video.

In it, William looked like a crazed man. Aria was still in her white wedding dress, pinned against a car door. William had wrapped his arm around her waist, kissing her like he couldn't bear to let her go.

He didn't stop until Aria was gasping for air, barely able to choke out a promise that she'd never marry anyone else.

Before long, William's friends crowded around him, their expressions a mix of shock and disbelief.

"What the hell are you doing, William? Today's your eighth anniversary with Emmy. You left her at home to crash a wedding? We barely covered for you by saying you had an emergency!"

William said nothing. He just held Aria in his arms and lit a cigarette. His refusal to speak only fed their desperation.

They pressed harder. "What's going on in your head? You used to be head over heels for Emmy. Don't tell us you're actually into Aria now!"

William finally stubbed out his cigarette and looked up, eyes rimmed red.

"I don't know. I can't live without Emmy. But the thought of Aria marrying someone else makes me so jealous it's unbearable. If you want a reason, fine. Maybe I love them both. Is that what you wanted to hear?"

Without waiting for a reply, he yanked open the car door and pulled Aria inside.

His friends' eyes widened in shock. They rushed forward, trying to stop him.

"William, have you lost your mind? You're actually comparing that gold-digger to Emmy? And now you're actually taking her home? How the hell are you going to explain this to Emmy?"

"I'll handle it. Don't worry about it. I just need time to figure out who I really love. Until then, Aria stays with me."

With that, William rolled up the window and sped off with Aria.

The video ended in silence as the screen faded to black.

Emily's mind went blank, and it felt like her heart had been stabbed clean through. In disbelief, she clicked on the video again. She couldn't stop watching.

By the ninth replay, another message from Aria popped up. "Finished the video, Ms. Caldwell? You know what they say. If a man falls for two women at the same time, he'll always choose the second. What do you think?"

Emily unclenched her fist. Deep, bloody crescent shapes marked her palm where her nails had dug in. A faint smile touched her lips.

But as she smiled, the tears came uncontrollably, while a flood of memories crashed over her all at once.

Everyone in their circle knew that William—the so-called "crown prince" of Huxbury's elite—was hopelessly devoted to his childhood sweetheart, Emily. His love for her had always bordered on obsession.

They'd grown up side by side, and he had protected her like a knight guarding his queen. He'd crawl out of bed at midnight to brew chamomile tea when she had cramps. He'd spent fortunes lighting up the night sky with fireworks just for her.

Any guy who got too close? William made sure they backed off. Even his Instagram feed had been filled with nothing but her.

Emily never imagined that three months of amnesia would be enough to erase all of that. That the young man who swore at 17 he'd love her forever would disappear for good.

A relentless wave of pain crashed through her chest, tearing at her nerves. She had cried until her eyes were swollen and dry. Now, she just sat there, staring blankly at the table full of cold dishes.

William had always spoiled her. He would've rather taught himself to cook than see her lift a finger in the kitchen. For eight years straight—from when he was 17 until now, at 25—he had kept that up without fail.

So this time, Emily had wanted to surprise him. She followed the recipes carefully, making all his favorite dishes.

But now, there was nothing left to celebrate.

She staggered to her feet and swept the candlelit dinner she'd spent five hours preparing into the trash. Then, she grabbed the photos from over the years and tossed them into the fire.

The picture of them kissing and making wishes under the northern lights. The candid he'd taken while she slept. The shot that captured the nervous, hopeful look in his eyes the day he confessed his love.

One by one, the moments that had once defined the happiest years of her life curled into ash.

When the last photo burned away, Emily picked up the gift she'd carefully prepared and dumped it down the drain. 

A pair of custom-made rings. One of a kind.

William had loved her unconditionally for eight years. Tonight was supposed to be the night she proposed. The night she gave herself to him completely.

Instead, he had chosen Aria.

After cleaning everything up, Emily called her mother on her phone. "Mom, I want to come to Fremoria to be with all of you."

Teresa Atkins didn't sound happy, just stunned. "What happened? Did William do something to you?"

Emily wasn't surprised that Teresa had guessed it so quickly.

Four years ago, when the Caldwells had moved their entire business overseas and immigrated as a family, Teresa and Emily's father, Arthur Caldwell, had wanted to take her with them.

But William had shown up at the Caldwell residence five times, pleading with Arthur and Teresa again and again. He couldn't lose Emily. He begged them to let her stay and swore he'd take care of her.

His parents, Edward Silverstein and Katie Newman, had also come to speak on his behalf. They reminded Arthur and Teresa that the Silversteins and Caldwells had been close family friends for years.

William and Emily had grown up together. It was only natural they'd end up married.

Their sincerity moved Arthur and Teresa. In the end, they agreed, but only under one condition—William had to sign an agreement.

If he ever hurt Emily and she left for Fremoria, he'd be permanently banned from ever setting foot there. From then on, they'd never see each other again, and any chance of reconciliation would be gone for good.
