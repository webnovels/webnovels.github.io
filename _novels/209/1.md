By the time I got to the company, it was already afternoon. My whole body ached, and as soon as I sat down, Dad called, full of praise. "Mimi, you got that piece of land. Well done this time. Stick with Asher, your brother will need you." I held the phone, looking at the reflection of a twenty-six-year-old woman in the mirror, full of self-mockery. "Dad, I'm not young anymore. There are plenty of eighteen or nineteen-year-old girls around Asher. How do you think I can keep him?" Dad's voice noticeably paused. "Besides, this is probably the last time Asher takes care of you." "Why?" The voice on the other end became tense, "Mabel, did you offend him? Apologize quickly! Your brother..." I gripped the phone tightly. My so-called family was so greedy. In their eyes, as long as I slept with Asher, I could bring resources to the family. I could be anything, but not a person. The overwhelming humiliation finally made my tears fall uncontrollably. "Because Nora is coming back." I didn't want to say more and hung up the phone. Outside, the secretary knocked cautiously. "Miss Jiang, the gift you requested is ready. Do you want to take a look?" I wiped away my tears, signaling her to bring it in. The watch in the box was beautiful and expensive. A Vacheron Constantin Flying Dutchman. Just like me, a Flying Dutchman that could never find land.
