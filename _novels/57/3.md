As I sped through the air, I clutched my belly, tears whipped away by the wind.

"Help! My child!" I screamed, my voice torn by the wind.

A searing pain tore through my abdomen, and I was horrified to feel a warm flow between my legs.

Looking down, my white dress was stained with shocking red.

My water had broken.

Suspended mid-air, I continued flying at high speed, the violent jostling making it hard to breathe.

Through teary eyes, I saw Emily nestled in Ethan's arms in the control room.

They watched the screen showing my struggle, Emily whispering something.

Ethan actually smiled, raising a champagne glass with the investors.

My voice screamed hoarsely, "Ethan! Save the child!"

No one responded.

The blood flowed more, dizziness sweeping over me.

Below, tourists gathered, some pointing, noticing something wrong.

My mind began to blur, the pain in my abdomen like a thousand arrows.

The zip line slowly reached the end, I had no strength to move.

But no one came to receive me.

The zip line automatically returned, dragging me back to the start, pushing me into the air again.

Second round.

My blood fell mid-air like red raindrops.

In the control room, Emily feigned surprise, "Oh, is sister-in-law on her period?"

Ethan frowned, disgusted, "So careless at this age, so dirty."

Saying that, he held Emily's waist, leaving with the investors.

They went to celebrate the successful launch of "Emily Canyon."

I wasn't discovered by the staff until the ninety-ninth round.
