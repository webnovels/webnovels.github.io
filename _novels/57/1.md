"I'm sorry, ma'am!" the waiter said, flustered.

"It's okay," I forced a smile, but when I looked up, Ethan was frowning at me. He was holding Emily at "Emily Canyon," engaging with a group of investors. He turned and scolded me.

"Sophie, can't you be more careful?"

I opened my mouth but couldn't muster a response. Emily took Ethan's arm and handed me a tissue with her other hand.

"Don't worry, sister-in-law."

"Today is a big day for 'Emily Canyon.' Ethan has a surprise planned for you!"

"What kind of surprise?" I asked, my voice trembling slightly with tension.

Emily led me to the viewing platform, pointing to the silver cable stretched above the canyon.

"Ethan said, as the founder's wife, you should be the first to experience our flagship project, the extreme zip line, to bring good fortune to it."

I instinctively withdrew my hand, staring at Ethan in disbelief. "Are you crazy? I'm nine months pregnant!"

He frowned, his gaze shifting nervously between me and the investors. "Sophie, don't make a scene."

"The doctor advised against any high-risk activities!" My voice quivered with fear.

"Are you saying you don't trust our safety measures?" Emily's voice suddenly took on an emotional tone, "Or do you think the project named after me is cursed?"

Ethan's expression darkened, his fingers clenched into a fist. "Sophie, don't ruin this."

"I'm not unsupportive," I explained desperately, "but you know my situation..."

"Today is Mother's Day. Isn't it the perfect time to experience motherhood? Emily means well," he smiled.

He wasn't talking about our unborn child, but about "Emily Canyon."

"No, I won't take that risk!" I instinctively stepped back.

Ethan's smile vanished as he grabbed my wrist.

"Sophie, don't make me look bad." He lowered his voice, threatening.

"Are you insane? This is our child!" I struggled to pull away.

He pulled me closer, whispering in my ear, "If you keep this up, I'll make you regret it later."

Emily gently pushed me from behind. "Don't be afraid, sister-in-law. I'll ensure the staff gives you the safest double protection."

Her hand pressed lightly against my waist.

I was half-dragged, half-carried to the zip line platform.

Tears blurred my vision as the staff approached to strap me into safety gear.

"Ethan, please don't do this to me..." My voice choked.

He just looked at me coldly. "Stop pretending. It's all for work."

Emily smiled sweetly beside me. "Sister-in-law, you're so brave. You'll bring good fortune to our project."

My legs shook.

The sound of the safety belt locking felt like a countdown to disaster.

I looked down at my swollen belly, overwhelmed with unprecedented fear and despair.

"I've carried this child for nine months, I'm about to give birth... Please don't..."

Ethan turned and walked to the control room without a glance back.

Emily whispered in my ear, "Don't worry, sister-in-law, you'll be free soon."
