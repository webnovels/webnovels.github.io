In order to pay off the debts of my husband, Scott Moore, who had failed in his investment, and also to treat my daughter, Laura Moore, I worked as a waitress during the day, delivered food on takeout orders at night, and even sold one of my kidneys on the black market.
Right after getting off the operating table in that illegal clinic, I insisted on hurrying to the wealthy villa area to do the cleaning job.
My colleague said enviously, "Be careful when you're washing this precious floor. This villa, worth fifty million dollars, was given by Mr. Moore to his fiancée. That woman is so lucky. I heard that just because she threw a tantrum once, Mr. Moore bought her a luxury car worth over ten million dollars in full payment."
I clenched my fists tightly and felt an icy chill all over my body.
There was a photo of them on the bedside table. On the messy big bed were black silk stockings stained with some white substance.
The man who was smiling gently in the photo, the one my colleague had just mentioned, turned out to be my husband, who had already gone bankrupt.
