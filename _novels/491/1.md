That night, I saw Megan's social media post.

It was a photo of James listening to her lecture, head bowed.

The caption read: [So glad to have you.]

Not long after, she posted a picture of sushi: [Thanks for still remembering what I like.]

I threw my phone aside.

Hugging my pillow, I felt miserable and couldn't sleep all night.

The next day, Megan updated her social media again.

It was a photo of James sleeping.

The caption was extremely suggestive: [You worked hard, handsome.]

There were no likes from any mutual friends.

I guess it was posted just for me to see.

My chest felt tight.

A while later, James sent me a message.

It said: "My mom wants you to try on wedding dresses.

Megan has an important surgery today, her first time as lead surgeon, so I need to supervise. I can't go with you."

I blocked him immediately.

When I went downstairs for breakfast, my mom had just gotten off the phone with James' mom.

She smiled and waved me over, saying James' mom had taken the day off to go dress shopping with me.

She said she'd also taken the day off to come along.

She went on: "I've always liked that James since he was little. My intuition was right, he's grown up to be so outstanding. Sophia, marrying him is like winning the lottery in your past life."

I bit my lip and gathered my courage to say: "Mom, I broke up with him, so naturally the engagement is off."

Mom's expression changed instantly.

"You're cancelling the engagement without any notice? Do you think this is some kids' game?"

My body trembled: "I thought James would have told you."

"James is so busy, and he has to put up with you playing these childish games. You really never learn to grow up, do you?"

Tears started falling uncontrollably: "That's right, I can't grow up. No one ever taught me how, so how am I supposed to grow up?"

My usually quiet dad suddenly spoke up: "If you don't want to get married, then don't. What's the big deal?"

Then he asked me: "You're not going to work at his hospital anymore?"

I answered: "No, Dad. I want to study abroad for a while."

Mom got even angrier and was about to speak, but Dad silenced her with a look.

"If you want to go, then go. This is the first time I've seen you be so decisive about something. That's good.

Don't worry, I'll handle the engagement cancellation."

Just then, I got a message from my best friend:

"Sophia, my brother's having a heart attack. He's at your fiancé's hospital now, but the process is so complicated. I'm worried my brother can't wait that long. Could you ask your fiancé to help take a look?"

On the phone, I was silent for a few seconds.

My friend suddenly apologized: "I'm so sorry, Sophia. I'm just too worried. You've said before you don't like this. I'm sorry! I'll figure something out myself!"

I sighed and said: "I'll head over first!"
