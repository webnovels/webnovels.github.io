Ten minutes later, I arrived at the hospital.

My friend's brother's condition looked quite serious.

I asked the nurse why none of the cardiology specialists were available.

The nurse grumbled that they had all been called to the operating room by James.

Megan was performing her first surgery as lead surgeon, and he wanted to ensure everything went perfectly.

Megan didn't have that kind of authority.

I knew this was James' doing.

After all, this whole hospital basically belonged to the Johnson family.

I called James many times.

But his phone was always off.

So I ran to wait outside the operating room.

After waiting for a long time, the surgery light finally went off.

James came out carrying Megan in his arms.

He glanced at me: "Why are you here?"

I grabbed his arm: "My friend's brother is in serious condition..."

Before I could finish, James shook off my grip and strode forward.

I jogged after him all the way to his office.

He carefully placed Megan in his rest area.

Then he sat down at his computer, staring intently at the screen.

I hurried over: "Dr. Johnson, my friend's brother is having a heart attack. It's urgent. Can you please go take a look?"

He looked up: "Why are you still here? Isn't my mom waiting for you to try on dresses?"

I emphasized again: "Can you please go check on him?"

James sighed slightly: "Megan just finished surgery. I'm worried she might have nightmares."

My heart ached, but I still persisted: "Then can you send another doctor over?"

"I can't. They need to monitor the patients' conditions. I won't allow any mistakes."

"James, don't you have any professional ethics? I've told you there's a critical patient outside. As a doctor, shouldn't you at least go take a look?"

He seemed surprised by my outburst.

He frowned and said coldly: "Sophia, how many times have I told you? In our profession, the most taboo thing is having empathy. No matter how serious a patient's condition is, we have to follow hospital procedures. When it's my turn to go, I'll go on time."

My voice softened: "Emma is my only friend left. Please, I'm begging you!"

He laughed coldly: "Didn't you just say yesterday that you wouldn't beg me anymore?"

"This is the last time!" Tears started streaming down my face.

James seemed to soften a bit.

But suddenly Megan's voice came from inside: "James, are you there? I'm scared."

James stood up and said coldly to me: "If you really can't wait, you can transfer to another hospital."
