Chapter 1

The company hired a new batch of interns.
To demonstrate humanistic care, I asked my secretary to reserve Starbucks for them and also planned to personally host the new employee training.
But when the coffee arrived, the top-ranked male intern tapped my shoulder.
“Hurry down and get the coffee! What kind of useless receptionist can't even figure this out?”
I was taken aback, it had been ages since anyone ordered me around like that.
Before I could reveal my identity, the intern shoved me hard again.
“Get moving! Can't you understand simple instructions?”
“I hate dealing with you vocational school brats. Can't even fetch coffee properly!”
“Mark my words，my uncle's the company president. Mess with me and I'll have you fired on the spot!”
I narrowed my eyes. Interesting.
I own 100% of this company. When did a new president pop up?
 
 
“Got it? Now get downstairs! Stop dawdling around here!”
Intern Frank Anderson pointed his finger at my nose and yelled.
Honestly, I was almost impressed by his nerve.
Ever since I snatched the heir position from my siblings seven years ago,
no one had dared speak to me like this.
Today was a new employee orientation, so it made sense these interns didn't recognize me.
But regardless of recognition or position, such disrespect was unacceptable.
I scanned the room. Many had already noticed the commotion, whispering among themselves.
“Did you hear that? Frank's uncle is actually the company president! Master is right here beside me!”
“Master gave an order, and this receptionist still won't go downstairs for coffee? Isn't that a bit too shameless !”
Some even flattered Frank with a sycophantic grin.
“Master, don't bother with that lowly receptionist. She couldn't afford a single pair of your shoes even if she worked her whole life!”
Watching the highly educated interns scramble to curry favor at Frank's slightest word,
I suddenly understood: sometimes, academic credentials don't equate to character.
Amidst the adulation, Frank grew even more smug, pointing his middle finger at me .
“Hear that, receptionist? If you want to keep your measly 3,000 dollar salary, get downstairs and fetch that coffee!”
“What if I refuse?” I met his gaze calmly.
Frank clearly hadn't expected an ordinary “receptionist” to publicly defy him.
His face flushed crimson with rage: Then I'm firing you! Get the hell out of here!"
As the tension reached its peak, a round-faced girl timidly spoke up.
“Mr. Anderson... please don't be so hard on the receptionist. Maybe she has her own responsibilities... How about I go get the coffee for everyone? Don't fire her...”
With this convenient escape route offered, Frank only snorted coldly.
“Is this useless receptionist your relative? Why's she so eager to help?”
He glared at me darkly: “Let me say it again. My younger uncle is the president of the company. I'm here for an internship just to go through the motions. I'll be a supervisor in a few days!  It's an upper-class person that a pariah like you will never come into contact with in your entire life !”
“If you know you're wrong, then scram downstairs in three seconds flat and fetch coffee for me--your Master! Or I'll blacklist you from the industry immediately!”
Frank's threats didn't faze me at all. Instead, I smiled: “Frank, go ask around. Find out who the real president of this company is—your uncle, or me, Arlene Hilton .”
I thought revealing my identity might make Frank back down or at least verify the facts.
But instead, he shoved me hard: “Who the hell do you think you are, pretending the CEO?”
“Ah... I get it now. You heard my uncle is the CEO and thought you could seduce him, didn't you? I advise you to give up that fantasy. Our Anderson Family is a wealthy one and doesn't look down upon a lousy guy like you !”
The chill in my eyes deepened.
The last person who spread slander about me is still in prison.
This Frank sure knows how to dance on landmines.
Just then, the conference room door swung open.
The round-faced girl struggled under the weight of dozens of coffee cups, flashing us a smile.
“Mr. Anderson, please calm down. I brought the coffee...”
She winked at me. “Sis, Mr. Anderson's in a rage. You should step out too...” ."
My heart warmed. Among this batch of interns, there were still some capable ones.
Just as I was about to grab a cup for the round-faced girl, Frank slapped my hand away.
“Hey, receptionist, just because you've never tasted such expensive coffee doesn't mean you can steal it!”
“This coffee was bought for everyone by my uncle, who did me a favor. You, a mere receptionist, have no right to drink it. Get out and drink your instant coffee!”

Chapter 2

Since the company's founding, despite internal job distinctions, I've always emphasized our philosophy of equality for all.
But with Frank, he considers himself an upper-class person, and the front desk staff feel inferior.
I have no idea how HR hired him.
Seeing I didn't respond, Frank proceeded to distribute coffee to everyone himself.
The extra cup? He poured it straight into a flowerpot!
"See that, front desk lady? I'd rather pour this Starbucks down the drain than give it to a lowlife like you!"
“Oh, and throw away this cup too—can't have this trash holding it for photos pretending to be a socialite to lure men!”
I stared at Frank calmly.
From the moment he entered the conference room, I'd given him countless chances.
But instead of backing off, Frank kept dancing on every landmine.
And his uncle...
I must uncover exactly who has the audacity to impersonate my CEO!
With that thought, I felt no urgency to reveal my identity to Frank. Instead, I smiled.
“Frank, you claim your uncle is the company president. Who exactly is he?”
Seeing my resolve soften, Frank grew even more smug.
“Don't think I don't know what you're up to. You're just trying to get info out of me so you can seduce my uncle, aren't you?”
“Lady receptionist, I've seen your type before. Not just any lowlife can walk through the doors of the Anderson Family. You'd be better off turning right at the exit and finding a delivery guy to marry!”
Those two sentences made me realize how ridiculous my earlier thoughts had been.
I immediately abandoned my plan to extract information, yanking open the conference room door to summon security.
But Frank slammed his hand against the door, blocking my exit.
“Think you can run after I called you out? No chance!”
“Here’s the deal: kneel down and kowtow to me twice, and I’ll let you go!”
“Otherwise... prepare to be blacklisted from the industry!”
I glared at Frank. “I hope you don't regret your words!”
The next second, Frank flung his coffee straight at me, instantly staining my bespoke suit!
Without hesitation, I slapped him across the face. “You're asking for it!”
Slap in the face in front of everyone, Frank exploded with rage. He grabbed my arm.
“Everyone, come and have a look, everyone!  This bitch couldn't have lured me to hit me here!  Do you think the company is your home?  Are there any rules left? ”
“A worthless junior college graduate trying to hook up with me, a guy still studying abroad? You must be out of your mind!”
“Whoever can make this woman kneel and kowtow to me apologizing, I'll have my uncle promote you on the spot!”
At the mention of promotion, the interns' eyes lit up instantly.
“I'll hold this crazy woman down for Mr. Anderson! Make her kowtow 99 times to him!”
“This bitch clearly tried to seduce the CEO. Probably slept her way into this receptionist job too!”
“Mr. Anderson has spoken today—this ungrateful receptionist must be made to apologize!”
The round-faced girl still retained some sense and desperately tried to stop them.
“What you're doing is illegal! Even if Frank's uncle is the CEO, you can't treat people like this!”
But her voice carried little weight, and she was quickly pushed to the ground.
I pulled out my phone to call security, but Frank swiftly snatched it away and smashed it to pieces.
“You bitch, trying to call some sugar daddy to save you? Too late!”
“In this company, my word is law! I decide everything!”

Chapter 3

I couldn't stand Frank's tyranny any longer.
This man may have degrees, but his character is rotten—he must be fired and blacklisted!
Not only that, but the interns who sided with Frank today will never be hired!
Before the crowd could pounce, I kicked Frank hard in the groin and flung open the door.
I was about to find security to get rid of this mob.
But the next second, those interns dragged me back into the conference room!
Frank clutched his groin, his face contorted in agony.
"You... you bitch! How dare you kick me! I'll kill you today! "
With a glance, interns immediately seized my arms, pinning me immobile.
“Mr. Anderson! This woman dared disrespect you! She needs to be taught a lesson!”
“Why not strip this bitch naked and dump her on the street? Let her become famous!”
Several high-achieving female interns huddled beside Frank, expressions filled with concern.
“Mr. Anderson, are you all right? Shall I accompany you to the hospital?”
Frank yanked my hair violently: “You won't learn your lesson unless we teach you a lesson, will you?”
“A worn-out whore like you dares to lay a hand on me? Looks like you've had enough of living!”
With that, Frank ordered the others to force me to my knees.
“You'd better kneel down and beg for mercy, then strip naked piece by piece for our amusement. Otherwise... otherwise I'll have you killed and no one will ever know!”
I narrowed my eyes. The last time I heard words like these, they came from my own brother and sister.
But now one is exiled overseas, never to return, and the other has been disowned from the family registry.
I wouldn't mind letting Frank taste that same fate.
Perhaps my gaze was too terrifying.
Frank's lackeys exchanged glances, none daring to force me to kneel.
Just as he was about to do it himself, the conference room door swung open.
Secretary Luis walked in carrying a thick stack of documents.
His face drained white at the scene. He pushed through the crowd and helped me up.
“What's going on here! Who gave you the nerve?”
Though these interns hadn't seen me before, they all knew Secretary Luis. No one dared speak.
Frank laughed loudly, thinking Secretary Luis was concerned about him. He slapped him on the shoulder.
“Luis, You're still quite sensible and know how to care about me, your future supervisor !”
“And what kind of hiring process did you use for this receptionist? Spouting nonsense with no sense of decorum! Get the HR manager here, I need to have a serious talk with him...”
Before he could finish, Secretary Luis had already guided me back to my seat, his face filled with worry.
“President, are you all right? I'll call the police immediately!”
