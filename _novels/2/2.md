I frowned as blood dripped from my forehead.
Now thoroughly angered, I glared at Vanessa with cold eyes.
"I'm an honored guest of the Harrison family. Who do you think you are?"
"Leave now, and I'll pretend this never happened."

Though you'll still have a streak of bad luck, I thought to myself.

Seeing that I didn't take her seriously at all, Vanessa could no longer contain herself.
With bloodshot eyes, she pounced on me, pinning me to the ground and raining blows on me.
I was pressed against the floor, completely unable to fight back.
But as she leaned in close, I managed to bite her ear hard.

Vanessa clutched her ear, glaring at me with murderous intent.
Her friends rushed over, pinning me down firmly, each of them slapping me across the face.
A searing pain tore through my scalp as I was thrown backward onto the gravel path.
I let out a muffled groan.

A circle of pointed high heels surrounded me, forming an impenetrable barrier.
As a heel ground into the back of my hand, I heard the faint crackle of my joints.

The first slap made my right ear ring.
"That's what you get for being a homewrecker, you shameless bitch."

The second blow left my left cheek stinging and swollen.
"Slut, I hate people like you who seduce other people's boyfriends. You're disgusting."

By the third slap, I could taste iron in my mouth.
"Someone like you doesn't deserve to live in this world."

They took turns yanking my hair back, my blood-matted strands sticking to my swollen cheeks.
Their nails deliberately raked across the corner of my eye, warm droplets of blood rolling down into my collar.
Their assault was so vicious that the two nearby servants were terrified.

I looked at them and shouted, "Quick, call Mr. Harrison!"
Gasping for air, I warned Vanessa coldly.
"Let me go now, or I swear you'll never set foot in the Harrison house again."

Vanessa let out a derisive laugh, kicking me repeatedly.
"You think I don't know anything? You're just a country bumpkin. Gift of prophecy? Ha!"
"You're just trying to seduce Lucas while I'm not around. I've seen through your little plan."

She kicked me in the ribs with the tip of her shoe. As I curled up, my forehead hit the edge of the cement, and blood immediately covered my right eye.
Finally, she grabbed the back of my neck and slammed me against the edge of the coffee table. As the porcelain cut into my chin, drops of blood splattered on the floor.

She laughed coldly and delivered a savage kick to my stomach.
"Bitch!"

I clutched my stomach, curling up into a ball.
"What are you doing?!" Mrs. Wilson finally emerged from the kitchen with a fruit platter.

Seeing my pitiful state, her pupils constricted sharply.
She hurried over to help me up.
"Miss Sullivan is the master's honored guest! The master instructed us to treat her well!"
"Who dared to lay hands on Miss Sullivan?"

She turned around and met Vanessa's eyes. Vanessa let out a light chuckle. "Mrs. Wilson."
"Miss Chen, why are you here?" Mrs. Wilson asked, surprised.

Vanessa looked at her coldly. "What honored guest? She's just some country girl trying to climb the social ladder."
"Let me tell you, I'm going to be the future Mrs. Harrison."

Mrs. Wilson looked at Vanessa, then at me.
Finally, she reluctantly let go of my hand.
I couldn't stand steady and fell back onto the floor.

Vanessa sneered, her face full of triumph.
"What gift of prophecy? I'd say she's just a con artist!"
"You tell me, does what she say really come true?"

Mrs. Wilson's eyes darted back and forth. She walked up to Vanessa.
"What gift of prophecy? She's just a fraud."

My heart sank.
