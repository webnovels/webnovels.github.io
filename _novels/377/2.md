With my permission, he immediately wrapped his arms around it, burying his face in the soft fur.
The snowy white fluff brushed against his face, and he let out a comfortable sigh.
His hand stroked my tail tip, slowly moving downwards. A shiver ran from my tailbone up my spine, then spread through my entire body. With each movement of his fingers, I couldn't help but blush, and my fox ears uncontrollably popped out from the top of my head.
I felt a little embarrassed. When he buried his face in my tail for the third time, I couldn't help but ask softly, "Are you feeling better?"
"Much better."
He wiped his face and released my tail, sitting up straight as if nothing had happened. Only his ears remained bright red.
I finally managed to compose myself and retract my tail.
But then he held out two snowy white strands of fur to me. "I'm sorry, I accidentally pulled these out just now."
I didn't understand what he meant, and hesitated before replying, "No, it's... it's okay?"
He cleared his throat. "This condition of mine usually comes on suddenly, and for so many years, I haven't found any effective way to relieve it. I heard Julian is sending you back... could you stay with me?"
"Huh?"
I was stunned, never imagining things would turn out this way.
On his face, he seemed to feign a certain nonchalance, adjusting his clothes, putting on the air of a perfect gentleman. "Don't misunderstand, it's just that my condition is quite peculiar. I've tried many things, but nothing makes me as comfortable as you just did... I'm not that kind of person; I don't mean to do anything to you."
His earnest expression looked exceptionally gentle in the moonlight.
I nodded demurely. "Then you can send me back first. When Julian sends me back in a few days, you can come pick me up."
He smiled. "Didn't you just say you were scared because it's dark? Don't go back then. You'll be coming with me anyway. I'll just tell him to bring the paperwork over."
With that, he picked up his phone and called Julian. Julian's voice on the phone held a hint of laughter, seeming very pleased. When he heard I was in Arthur's car, he chuckled.
"Perfect! I'm going to be with Chloe these next few days. You can handle her for me."
"I was wondering what to do with such a big nuisance. You truly are my best friend. I'll have someone send you the paperwork right away. You can help me send her back."
I sat beside him, the voice from the phone clearly audible in my ears.
Arthur's face changed. He carefully watched my expression.
"Willow has been with you for so many years; this is a bit too... humiliating."
Julian's voice was nonchalant. "You don't understand, Beastkin like her are cheap. She's desperately in love with me. What's wrong with me sending her back?"
"Later, when I have time, I'll go see her, and she'll still come crawling back."
"Alright, alright, I'm busy setting up the proposal venue for Chloe. Just deal with it."
As Julian hung up, the car fell silent.
Arthur looked at me cautiously, as if apologizing for his friend's words.
"Julian, he... he just has that kind of temper."
But I didn't feel as humiliated as I expected. Hadn't I known this all along?
