I shifted, then turned back to him with a innocent smile. "No, why would I be looking for him?"
"I just thought the view here was nice, and quiet."
"Do you like it here too, Mr. Arthur?"
He adjusted his shirt, looking around as if unsure what was so appealing about the corner of a staircase.
"I think the people are more beautiful."
"Huh?"
I was taken aback, then followed his gaze to the crowd in the main hall. Julian was among them, holding the hand of a girl in a white dress, protectively cradling her. Unlike the perpetually cold and arrogant expression he always wore for me, he was melting with tenderness.
I secretly scoffed, realizing this must be the young Sterling heiress. She was indeed very different.
Unlike my feigned innocence, she exuded a pure, untouched cleanliness, like someone raised in a crystal vase, shielded from the world by money.
I lowered the corners of my mouth in self-derision. Someone like me, who had to struggle and roll in the dirt to survive, probably didn't even have the right to envy her.
After watching for a long time, I finally tore my eyes away, feeling a bitter ache.
Arthur shrugged. "Looks like he won't be taking you home tonight. I'll drive you."
Under the bright crystal chandelier, his smile was clean, like an easy mark.
I smiled. "Alright, that would be helpful."
Unlike Julian's coldness and cruelty, Arthur's chivalry seemed ingrained in his very being.
He gently opened the car door for me. Noticing my nose reddened by the cold wind, he took off his jacket and draped it over my shoulders.
A soft woody scent enveloped me. As I buckled my seatbelt, I subtly brushed against his arm, feigning an accident.
He didn't react.
I wiggled my hips slightly, then spoke in a soft, quiet voice. "It's so late, and going upstairs alone can be a little scary."
He gripped the steering wheel, not even glancing at me. "I'll drop you off downstairs and wait until you're upstairs before leaving. The lights are on, there's nothing to be scared of."
I fell silent.
The car was about to pull into my apartment complex, and all the tricks I'd learned to seduce people failed me. I couldn't think of anything suitable.
I sighed inwardly. Fine, I'd just have to find a way to approach Dorian another day.
Suddenly, the smoothly driving car screeched to a halt at the side of the road.
Arthur's face was flushed, his breathing rapid. He leaned against the steering wheel, struggling, as if hit by a sudden illness.
I gasped, forgetting all about seduction. I quickly leaned over. "What's wrong? Do you have any emergency medicine in the car? Should I call your assistant or 911?"
He seemed to be in immense pain, his voice trembling slightly. "No need. They can't help."
I grew even more frantic. If something happened to him while he was with me, I didn't know how many people would want to skin me alive. "Then what do we do?"
He lifted his head, the corners of his eyes red. He seemed to be struggling with something difficult to confess, hesitating for a long time before finally speaking.
"This is a psychological trauma from my childhood... I need something to soothe it."
"If... if it's okay, could I... touch your tail?"
I froze.
He seemed equally embarrassed. "I know it's a huge imposition, but my condition is very particular..."
"I... forget it... just let me suffer... it'll pass in a bit..."
He lowered his head, gasping with difficulty, as if he was about to collapse.
After a moment of hesitation, I released my tail from behind me. In the human world, I was always careful to hide these Beastkin features. To humans, they were symbols of our otherness. Julian particularly hated my tail; I never dared to show it in front of him.
But on Arthur's face, I saw no disgust. He stared at my fluffy, large tail, his eyes even showing a hint of pathological craving.
"Can I?"
