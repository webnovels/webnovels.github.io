My Fiancée's Beloved Twins Have Turned Off Their Phones Again

This time, her way of coaxing them back is to postpone our wedding once more.

They never seem to tire of this game - using me to win back their lovers.

I've questioned her, begged her, even ran away from home.

But each time, I'm no match for those twins turning off their phones. And all she gives me in compensation is a bouquet of roses.

Olivia Shaw looked at the ninety-eight bouquets of roses piled in the corner of the room and said with a smile:

"Now we have ninety-nine bouquets. When we reach nine hundred and ninety-nine, we'll have our wedding. How romantic is that?"

"You're a man, you should understand my feelings, right? I only have a desire to conquer them. Once I win them over, I'll come back and marry you, and we'll live happily ever after."

I took the roses she handed me, nodded, then turned and dialed a number.

"I have a ready-made wedding here, just missing a bride. Want to come?"
