The first thing that Samantha Knott did after being reborn was rush to the airport.

The airport was packed with people. Panting heavily, she pushed her way through the crowd before finally spotting three familiar silhouettes near the departure gate.

Harry Wright was dressed in a tailored suit. He was particularly eye-catching among the throng of people thanks to his cold and regal demeanor. Joseph Wright, who was five years old, was also dressed in a small suit, looking like a miniature version of his father.

Meanwhile, Lydia Yeager was wearing a white dress as she stood elegantly by their side. The picture the three of them made gave off the impression that they were a family.

"Harry Wright!" Samantha yelled, her voice echoing around the airport.

The three of them turned to look at her in unison.

"Samantha?" Harry frowned slightly. "What are you doing here?"

Samantha's gaze fell on Lydia. "Who is she? What are the three of you planning to do?"

Lydia quickly stepped forward. Her explanation came out in a rush. "Don't misunderstand, Ms. Knott. Harry and I are just friends. We're just going on a family trip. Harry's parents will be joining us as well."

Harry's brows knitted together as he pulled Lydia to him and shielded her behind his back. He glared icily at Samantha, asking, "How did you find out about this? Did you come here to cause trouble?"

Joseph shoved Samantha aside, shouting, "Don't get in the way of our family trip, Mommy! You don't know anything, so you only deserve to stay at home!"

Samantha felt cold all over. "Since this is a family trip, why don't I deserve to come along? I am your mother and your father's wife. Why does she deserve to join the trip when I don't?"

The people around them were giving them strange looks, causing Lydia's eyes to redden in an instant. 

Harry and Joseph could feel their hearts breaking upon realizing how troubled she looked. They glared at Samantha. "Why are you causing such a ruckus? Don't you have any shame?"

"You're so shabby, which is why we didn't want to bring you along." Joseph looked at her with disdain in his eyes. "Ms. Yeager is gentler and prettier than you. She's better than you in every way. I'm devastated that I have a mother like you!"

Every word was like a knife that pierced itself deep into Samantha's heart.

In her past life, Samantha was simply a spinning top that never got tired in the Wright family's eyes. She would crawl out of bed before dawn to prepare Harry's suit and tie for him. She would also look through Joseph's homework even if it was already late at night.

If Harry's parents, Heath Wright and Madeline Green, were unwell, she would personally serve them drinks and medicine and keep vigil by their bedside.

She had looked after them for 50 years. Her hair had even turned white from the stress. But in the end, in their eyes, she was just a caretaker that they could order around as they pleased. In fact, she was taking up unnecessary space just by existing.

Noticing how the situation was quickly spiraling out of control, Lydia hastily purchased an additional flight ticket. "Ms. Knott, why don't you come along with us? I'm sorry. We're the ones who neglected your feelings."

The moment she apologized, Harry and Joseph became even more convinced that Samantha had shown up to cause trouble.

Harry and Joseph orbited around Lydia for the entire flight, causing the flight attendant to mistake the three of them for a family.

Samantha sat in the last row, looking at the sea of clouds beyond the window. She recalled what Harry had told her before she took her last breath in her past life.

"I'm unwilling to trap her in the kitchen. I want her to be my princess."

How laughable. Samantha worked herself to the bone and became a worn-out housewife for the Wrights, while Lydia would be a princess for the rest of her life.

When they arrived at their destination, Heath's and Madeline's expressions darkened upon seeing Samantha. "Why are you here?" they asked.

Samantha ended up being totally ignored during the three-day vacation. The Wrights were always hanging around Lydia, praising her elegance and intelligence, telling her how kind and caring she was.

Meanwhile, Samantha was like the air around them. She stood in a corner and watched them enjoy themselves. When they were taking a group photo, she tried joining them, afraid of experiencing the awkwardness of being left out.

However, Joseph shoved the camera into her hands and said, "You don't fit in with us, Mommy. Take the photo for us instead."

Numb, Samantha raised the camera and looked into the lens. Harry had one arm wrapped around Lydia's shoulders while Joseph pressed himself close into her side. Heath and Madeline were wearing affectionate smiles.

The scene she saw through the lens was identical to the photo that had angered her to death in her past life. Her hands were shaking so badly that she nearly dropped the camera when she clicked the shutter. She gnawed on her bottom lip, refusing to let the tears in her eyes spill down her cheeks.

When it was time to descend the mountain, Samantha realized that all three cars were already packed with no space left for her.

"Find your own way home."

Harry didn't spare a single glance back at her before getting into the car.

Samantha walked along the winding mountain path by herself. The blazing sun shining relentlessly down on her made her dizzy. Her legs were swollen, and she could barely move them. In the end, she had to drag her exhausted body onto the last plane of the night that flew her back home.

They didn't show her any concern, and they didn't feel even a shred of guilt. When they spoke to her, it was only to order her around.

"Iron my clothes," Harry said as he tossed his blazer in front of her.

"Tidy up my toys," Joseph said as he kicked the toys that were scattered all over the floor in her direction.

At that moment, the fury that Samantha had been harboring in her heart for two lifetimes exploded.

"Harry Wright, I want a divorce!"

Her voice wasn't too loud, but her words were like a clap of thunder, shocking everyone in the living room.

Both Harry and Joseph were momentarily stunned. Disbelief was written all over their identical and handsome faces.

"Do you understand what you're saying?" Harry asked, his voice glacial.

"Yes." Samantha raised her head and stared directly into his eyes. "I want a divorce," she repeated, making sure to emphasize every word.

They scoffed, assuming she was just playing hard-to-get as they asked their lawyer to drop by.

"I bet you're regretting it now." Joseph looked at her with disdain. His young face was filled with a coldness that did not match his age. "There's still time for you to regret your decision. Hurry and apologize to us. Daddy and I will pretend that we didn't hear anything."

Samantha simply smirked as she grabbed the pen. She didn't hesitate for even a second when she penned her signature on the divorce agreement.

She didn't want them anymore in this life!
