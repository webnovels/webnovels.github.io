“No playing the victim! Confess honestly, or I’ll eat you, Miss.” I bared my fangs. Don’t think foxes only have ears and tails; I eat meat too!

Davey shrank back in fear, his shoulders trembling.

Tears clung to the corners of his eyes, and I felt a little soft-hearted. He was still young, after all.

“Miss, you’re far too easy to trick.”

What kind of horrible personality was that? I must have been blind to think he was a sweet, innocent boy.

I was furious. I lunged, biting at his neck.

Suddenly, black mist filled the air, and my tails were forcibly flung away.

Before I could recover, Davey turned the tables. A large scythe, covered in black cloth strips, appeared out of nowhere, held horizontally in front of me.

Davey was wearing a black robe, with smoky eyeliner circles so dark, it looked like he hadn’t slept in three days.

If he just had a guitar, he'd be a middle schooler trying to be a death metal rock star.

The scythe hooked my waist. With a slight pull, I tumbled into his arms.
