It was a dark and stormy night. Perfect for murder… *cough, sputter*... I mean, for *hunting*. Let's see which lucky soul falls into my hands tonight.

I randomly picked a guy, pinned him against the wall, and went in for a kiss. Just absorbing life essence, no need for all that fancy stuff.

A little 'take-charge' approach is always popular, isn't it?

Except, could my little wallflower stop squirming already? Seriously, what’s this guy on? He's surprisingly strong; I can barely hold him down!

“Move again, and I’ll kiss you to death!” I growled, grinding my teeth.

Huh, he actually stopped. He just went completely rigid.

“Are you craving again, Miss?”

A large hand gently cupped the back of my head, an utterly intimate gesture.

I looked up, and in the dim light, I saw his face.

Handsome, tall, with that sly smirk—it was that arrogant jerk from yesterday!

“Do you just go around ambushing random guys every night?” he suddenly leaned in, whispering into my ear, “That’s dangerous, you know. What if you run into a bad guy?”

My face flushed hot.

He ruffled my hair, then, just as I was getting flustered, he slipped out of my grasp. Walking away, he called out, “This isn’t good for you, Miss. You should head home.”

I snapped back to reality. I failed again!

As I stamped my foot in frustration, he looked back under the streetlamp, still not far away. “Or, you could come home with me?”

My fox ears practically shot straight up. Was this for real?!
