Davey’s chicken was absolutely delicious.

After gnawing on the last drumstick and seeing the mountain of bones on the table, I let out a satisfied burp.

Davey naturally began clearing the table. He was wearing a white T-shirt, his bangs neatly combed back, making him look soft and warm, as if bathed in a gentle light.

His eyelashes fluttered like tiny brushes against my heart, tickling me.

His apron strings dangled loose, highlighting an impossibly narrow waist. *Gulp.*

It’s okay. Soon, this slender-waisted boy would be all mine.

I shot up, wanting to pull him into a hug. But after two steps, my head felt so dizzy.

Huh—?

One Davey, two Daveys, so many Daveys!

“That ‘drunken chicken’ dish had a lot of booze. You ate too happily and got tipsy.”

Tipsy? But what about my big meal? I hadn’t absorbed his life essence yet!

No way I’m letting you get away tonight!

I pounced, biting down.

“Good girl, settle down.”

Suddenly, I was airborne. Davey had picked me up.

He looked so skinny, how did he have so much strength?

What did you say? What was Davey’s expression? How would a drunk fox know? But I was definitely happy, that much was true.
