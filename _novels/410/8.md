I successfully absorbed the handsome Davey’s life essence.

But I ended up in the hospital, unlucky me.

That arrogant jerk at least had a conscience; he got me a VIP room.

“Awake?” He looked at me with a cold face.

I was the one who passed out from absorbing *his* life essence, why was he giving *me* attitude?

“The doctor said you had food poisoning. He told me to warn you to be careful next time.”

*Food poisoning.* *Careful next time.* He emphasized those words particularly heavily.

If my human university professors had highlighted key points like that, I wouldn't have failed so many classes and almost not graduated.

“What kind of poisoning did I get?” I felt a little panicky, but then I sensed my body. My ninth tail seemed to have grown out.

I ignored the pain all over my body, grimacing as I rushed to the bathroom.

Locked the door.

I released all nine of my tails, ready to admire my nine-tailed glory.

This was it, nine tails! Let’s see who dares say I’m a bad cultivator now.

However, I looked at the tails behind me, then at my reflection in the mirror.

What the hell?!

I’m a white fox!

A snow-white fox with not a single stray dark hair, so how did I grow a black tail?!

I hugged the dark, ugly tail and burst into tears, whimpering like a puppy.

I’m so ugly now! Who wants this tail? Can I just cut it off?

I seriously couldn’t face anyone like this!
