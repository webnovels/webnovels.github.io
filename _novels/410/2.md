Back home, I looked at the empty sandwich wrapper in my hand, then smacked myself on the head twice, fuming.

How did I eat it all? I didn’t even get a drink. Oh right, Davey didn’t buy me one.

Just thinking about today's epic fail made me cringe.

Nine hundred years old, and I got clowned by a kid who hadn’t even shaved yet.

What an absolute disgrace! No way. Next time, I’m going on the offensive. I *will* get my man!

Once that burst of adrenaline faded, I deflated like a punctured balloon.

Seriously, seducing people is hard. My face just has a mind of its own. It blushes whenever it damn well pleases, no matter how much I tell it not to!

Especially today, when Davey got close. He was so handsome, way better looking than any male fox in our clan.

I patted my burning cheeks, trying to hype myself up.

Willow, don’t get sidetracked by pretty faces. You’re carrying the hopes of your entire clan! You have to be a professional fox spirit.

You need to make those jerks who said you couldn't seduce a man eat their words.

I puffed out my chest again, ready to conquer.

Listen up, my prey! The Nine-Tailed Queen is here! Tremble, mortals!
