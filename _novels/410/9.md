The first thing I did when I got home was tie that arrogant jerk up tight.

Seeing him restrained by eight of my tails, lying motionless on the bed, I weirdly felt he possessed a certain tortured beauty.

That thought scared the crap out of me. Was something wrong with my fox brain?

I let that ugly tail out separately, using it as a whip. In my excitement, the black tail snapped against the floor with a loud crack.

That arrogant jerk shivered all over. I felt a little satisfied.

“Confess leniently, resist severely. Tell me, which temple sent you to harm me? Why did I get a stomach ache and grow a black tail after absorbing your life essence?”

I looked at the dark tail, sniffled, and fought back tears.

“Miss, I didn’t do anything. You forced me.”

“That’s nonsen…!” I slammed on the brakes.

Huh, he was right, wasn’t he? Suddenly, my conscience felt a little pain.

“How can you turn the tables on me like that?!”

Oh no, my conscience hurt even more.
