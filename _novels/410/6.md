When I sobered up in the middle of the night, I saw my clothes were still perfectly on. I pouted.

Remembering my cousin Scarlett’s teachings, I transformed into a thin nightgown, my legs bare, and slipped out of the guest room.

It was the middle of the night, and I felt a little guilty.

But Davey had explicitly agreed! I was just finishing what we started. He couldn’t blame me.

I tiptoed to the master bedroom. The door wasn’t locked; it was even left ajar. Wasn't that an invitation?!

I quietly pushed the door open, slowly crawled onto Davey’s bed, and snuggled up next to him. My mouth was aimed right at his.

Life essence, come to mommy!

I sucked hard.

Davey’s eyes suddenly snapped open, and he clamped a hand over his mouth.

We stared at each other like two startled deer caught in headlights. The absorption process was interrupted, and I started coughing so hard the room shook.

He did that on purpose! He totally did!
