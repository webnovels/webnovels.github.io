Davey switched on the lamp, looking at me with exasperation.

Maybe he’d just woken up, his hair was messy, and his pajama top was open, revealing his abs.

I instinctively knelt obediently on his lap, looking up at him.

“You promised me,” I said, trying to straighten my back, my voice a little shaky.

“Miss, you don’t do this with everyone, do you?”

I froze.

Thinking back, I usually just knocked them out and absorbed. This was the first time I’d met someone so difficult.

I shook my head. “Only you.”

“Are you serious, Miss?”

“Super serious!” I pouted.

The tense lines on Davey’s face softened. He shook his head helplessly, then chuckled softly.

He shook his head again, then opened his arms to me.

What a turnaround! What a ray of light! This was it!

I leaped into his arms, giddy with excitement, and he wrapped me in a tight embrace.

A single layer of fabric couldn't stop the warmth from spreading. Davey was like a furnace, radiating warmth.

Davey’s face drew closer and closer. I slowly closed my eyes, my other senses sharpening.

I felt his scorching breath, felt his lips capture mine.

So soft!

His tongue began its conquest, and I had no power to resist, dizzyingly following his rhythm.

It wasn't until I was about to gasp for air that Davey finally released me.

My lips and tongue were numb. Good thing I got that life essence, or it would have been a total waste.

…I went silent. Did I just forget to absorb life essence?

I jolted upright, startled, my head hitting Davey’s chin. My ears *hurt*.

Wait, my ears!!! I quickly reached for the top of my head. Sure enough, they were out. I quickly pulled them back in. With my hair covering them, and in this darkness, Davey probably didn’t notice, right?

Fox spirits can’t reveal their true forms to humans. I didn’t want to end up singing the blues in a jail cell.

The next second, my entire body froze.

My tail… it was out.

Like a broken record, I slowly lowered my head, staring at the tails wildly waving around the room. I closed my eyes in despair.

It was just a kiss! How could I get so emotional?! If the clan found out, I’d be laughed to death!

Next time I need life essence, I’m finding a blind guy.

A soft chuckle came from above my head.

“So you really are a fox, Miss. No wonder you’re so beautiful—and so soft.”

Davey was holding one of my tails, gently kneading it. I tentatively tried to pull it back.

Davey narrowed his eyes, looking at me meaningfully. Then, he stroked my tail from the very tip all the way to the root.

All my fox fur stood on end. My entire body felt like it was zapped with electricity.

“Are you sick?!” I shrieked, furiously trying to snatch my tail back.

I pulled. It wouldn't budge?!

Suddenly, he flipped over, pinning me down on the bed.

In the darkness, I could hear both our heartbeats quickening.

“Don’t get distracted, my little fox.”
