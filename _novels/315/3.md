At the hospital, the doctor frowned. “Ms. Stone, you got pregnant again so soon after your previous miscarriage, and now you’re carrying triplets… If you miscarry again this time, you might never be able to conceive.”

I froze, my hand unconsciously stroking my swollen abdomen, my fingertips trembling slightly.

“If… if I abort the babies now, what will happen to them?”

I asked in a low voice, so hoarse it was almost inaudible.

The doctor sighed, then slowly spoke. “Under normal circumstances, the hospital helps arrange cremation and a proper burial, as per family wishes.”

“But if the family doesn’t request it, the babies are incinerated collectively.”

He paused, a hint of anger in his voice.

“However, the most outrageous thing is when some people promise their wives they’ll handle the burial properly, but then just throw the baby into the toilet.”

“Later, the cleaning staff found the baby stuck in the toilet drain. They had to be forcibly flushed away. There was no proper send-off at all.”

My head snapped up, my throat tight, my voice trembling. “What was the pregnant woman’s name? When did this happen?”

The doctor flipped through his records. “I remember, it was about half a year ago. The pregnant woman’s name was…”

“Mrs. Hayes.”

BOOM—

My head spun with a violent ringing, as if something had exploded in my ears.

I slowly stood up, my hands clenched so tightly around my clothes that my knuckles turned white and my fingers trembled.

That was *my* baby!

From the moment I knew I was pregnant, I’d started fantasizing about our family of three after the birth.

Imagining the baby growing up, calling me ‘Mommy’…

But for Jaxson, I had no choice but to let go.

He had held my hand that day, as I went into the operating room, promising me he would take care of our baby.

He had even taken me to see that small grave mound after that day.

But I never, ever imagined that little life, who never got to enter this world, would end up like *that*. Thrown away like trash by his own hands!

I bit down hard on my lip, tears streaming down my face.

My chest felt hollowed out, the pain so intense I could barely stand.

I retreated inch by inch until my back hit the cold wall, a suppressed sob escaping my throat.

The last shred of hesitation in my heart was utterly broken.

I clenched my fists, my nails digging deep into my palms. I looked up at the doctor.

“I’ve decided. I want the surgery immediately.”

After the surgery, I lay on the hospital bed, gathering my strength. I dialed a number.

“Damian, I’m ready. Come pick me up tonight.”

That evening, Jaxson returned home, his face etched with impatience. The moment he pushed open the door, he roared.

“Harper, why did the clinic call me today saying you missed your prenatal check-up?!”

“Are you kidding me?! I already explained to you, Sera and I were meeting a client, that’s why we couldn’t make it back!”

Sera followed behind him, clutching his arm, feigning comfort.

“Harper, don’t be mad. Jaxson and I were working. Don’t think too much, okay?”

I sat pale on the sofa, my gaze coldly fixed on her arm wrapped around Jaxson’s. A faint, scornful smile touched my lips.

Sera’s smile stiffened. She shrank her hand back.

Jaxson’s face instantly darkened, anger churning in his eyes. He threw his jacket violently onto the sofa.

“What exactly do you want?! Don’t you dare act out just because you’re pregnant!”

His voice suddenly rose, rage practically spewing from him. “Haven’t I been working this hard for *you*?! Are you trying to use the baby to vent your anger and threaten me now?!”

With that, he kicked the sofa, with so much force that the cushion almost flew off.

Just then, my phone buzzed. I slowly stood up and walked towards the door.

Jaxson instinctively reached out to grab me, but I shifted, avoiding his hand.

He turned livid, his voice laced with threat. “Fine, Harper. If you don’t explain yourself today, don’t expect me to tolerate you anymore!”

I glanced back at him from the doorway, a cold smile slowly curving on my lips.

“You’re right. Nothing can happen to the babies. I’m going to get checked right now.”

Jaxson seemed to sense something different. His eyes froze on me for a moment.

Then, his gaze dropped, landing on my slightly slimmer belly.

His face changed instantly. Just as he was about to say something,

I cut him off coldly. “Your gift is right by the sofa. Hope you both like it.”

By now, Sera had already torn open the express box. A nauseating stench washed over us.

She looked inside, her face instantly turning ashen. She shrieked, recoiling sharply, almost stumbling.

Jaxson turned at her scream, his face stiffening. He froze, pupils wildly dilating, the shock and fear in his eyes instantly devouring all his anger.
