When I got home, the moment I pushed open the door, a flurry of hurried movement erupted in the living room.

Jaxson’s lips still bore a tell-tale smudged lipstick mark, while Sera, head bowed, fumbled to straighten her skirt.

Back then, when Sera offered to buy our house and let us continue living there, I was so grateful I almost wept. I thought she was so thoughtful, so kind-hearted.

But now, I saw it for what it was: a convenient arrangement for her and Jaxson to meet.

I took a deep breath, forcing myself to act as if I hadn’t seen anything. I turned to change my shoes.

Jaxson approached me, his face plastered with that fake smile. “Harper, why are you out by yourself with your belly so big? You make me worry.”

Once, I would have thought that was genuine concern.

But now, I finally understood. He wasn't worried about me. He was worried about *his* babies with *her*.

I said flatly, “My stomach felt bloated. I went for a walk.”

Sera’s eyes flashed with panic at my words.

She reached out, attempting to touch my belly. “Are the babies okay? Have you been eating something you shouldn’t have?”

Instinctively, I recoiled sharply, pushing her hand away, my voice cold.

Her smile instantly froze, replaced by a wounded whine. “What are you doing? I was just trying to show concern!”

I took another deep breath. “Sera, if you love children so much, why don’t you have your own?”

Jaxson’s face darkened. He strode forward, his voice low and sharp. “Harper! Sera means well. How can you talk to her like that?”

Then his gaze shifted to Sera.

She stood with her head down, lips trembling, the very picture of pitiful vulnerability:

“I know you look down on women like me who have health issues and can’t have children. But I simply love kids. Please don’t misunderstand, okay?”

Jaxson’s brows furrowed. His voice was low and cold, but clearly biased. “See! What nonsense are you spouting? Apologize to Sera, now!”

My chest felt as if it were being ripped open by a sharp blade, cut by cut. The pain was so intense I couldn’t even breathe.

The gentle, caring husband I once knew now only showed impatience and anger.

I bit my lip hard, my throat dry. Too exhausted to argue, I turned and went back to my room.

After the house was sold to Sera, Jaxson had said with a smile:

“It wouldn’t be right for us to stay in the master bedroom.”

“Why don’t you just stay in the small guest room on the first floor? That way you don’t have to go upstairs. It’s safer.”

Back then, I was foolishly grateful for his thoughtfulness, believing he had my best interests at heart.

But now, it was clear. All of it was just to make it easier for him and Sera to enjoy their undisturbed life upstairs.

He followed me in, sitting on the edge of the bed, putting on that mask of fake tenderness.

“Harper, don’t overthink things. Once the babies are born and we’ve paid off the debt, we won’t have to live under anyone’s thumb anymore!”

He reached out, gently stroking my hair, his voice as soft as it used to be. “Then, we’ll have a baby of our own, and we’ll be a family, forever!”

For a fleeting second, I almost wavered. I wanted to ask him.

Had he ever dreamed of the baby who never got to come into this world, like I had?

If he loved Sera so much, why didn’t he just marry her a year ago after his brother’s accident?

Why had he suddenly proposed to *me* then?

But all the words caught in my throat.

I watched him reach out, seemingly wanting to touch my belly, but his movement halted when he saw my swollen abdomen and the faint stretch marks already appearing.

A flicker of instinctive revulsion crossed his eyes. In that instant, his fake tenderness couldn't hide the coldness and disdain in his gaze.

My heart felt like it had been carved out with an ice pick, completely shattered into pieces.

I let out a cold laugh, the corners of my lips curving into a smile that was uglier than a cry.

Looks like some questions don’t need asking anymore.

Seeing my silence, his face darkened. “I know you’re hormonal during pregnancy, but you chose to be a surrogate to help me pay off my debts. So stop being so passive-aggressive and making things uncomfortable.”

I lowered my head, my throat tight, my heart chilling to the core.

Yes, I chose all of it.

I brought this upon myself.

Seeing my expression, he put on his "tender and caring" facade again, gently comforting me.

“Alright, don’t be mad. I have to go out for a few days. Sera helped me get a new client.”

“I’ll definitely be back to accompany you before your prenatal check-up this weekend. I’ll bring you a gift.”

I looked at the extreme hypocrisy in his tender expression, a slow smile spreading on my lips.

“Okay. I’ll have a gift for you too, then.”
