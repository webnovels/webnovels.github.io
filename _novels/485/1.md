My consciousness was fading, but then a familiar figure finally appeared in my blurred vision.

“Julian, I feel awful.”

My voice was hoarse. I struggled to look up, but Julian Thorne’s gaze was fixed on Amber White.

He tossed two large duffel bags full of cash onto the floor, his voice cold.

“I brought the five million dollars you asked for. Now, let them go, can’t you?”

Amber whimpered, tears streaming down her face. “Julian!”

Julian Thorne frowned, annoyed, then anxiously rushed towards Amber.

It felt like a bucket of icy water had been dumped over my head, chilling my blood to the core.

When Julian Thorne was about a yard away from Amber, the kidnapper carelessly tossed the detonator in his hand.

“Julian Thorne, you can only save one.”

“I gave them both the strongest aphrodisiac. Only a man can cure it.”

“One will be pampered beneath you.”

“The other… will be thrown into the streets, a plaything for countless men, tossed aside like trash.”

He laughed maniacally, his eyes darting between the three of us.

My hair stood on end, tears of terror welled up, and I screamed desperately.

“Julian, please, take me with you!”

“I’m scared, I’m so scared…”

Julian Thorne hesitated, his brows tightly furrowed as he looked at me.

“I want to save both of them. Name your price.”

The kidnapper’s laugh was chilling. His palm slid across my chest, pinching the tender flesh until it bruised.

“No, you can only pick one.”

I cried out in pain, but then I saw Julian Thorne had already untied Amber’s ropes.

He tenderly brushed over the red marks on her wrists, pulling her into his embrace and gently soothing her.

“Don’t be scared, Amber. I’m here.”

I gathered every ounce of strength I had, trying to awaken Julian Thorne’s love for me.

“Julian, don’t leave me here alone!”

Julian Thorne took a small step, and Amber leaned into his chest, her eyes heavy with desire, her hands fumbling with his buttons.

“Julian, I’m so hot. Please help me, okay?”

He frowned, looking conflicted, his voice low and hoarse. His words shattered my world, sending me straight to hell.

“Amber’s honor...it's critical right now, Stella. She can’t wait.”

“They won’t dare touch you. Just wait for me. I’ll come back for you after I’ve settled her.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Julian Thorne impatiently picked up Amber and rushed out of the warehouse.

My mind went completely blank. I numbly stared at Julian Thorne’s decisive retreating back, tears streaming down my face.

The kidnapper crudely patted my cheek, then dragged an iron bar from the corner.

“Oh dear, Julian Thorne doesn’t want you anymore.”

“But I heard he cares a lot about you.”

“Tell me, if I were to cripple your hand, would he get angry?”

Before I could react, the thick iron bar slammed down on the knuckles of my left hand.

My face went pale, and a metallic taste filled my mouth.

It hurt so much, like my flesh was being ripped from my bones.

After my five fingers were shattered, I was roughly thrown into the trunk of a car and driven to a bridge underpass where the beggars lived.
