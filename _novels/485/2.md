When I opened my eyes again, a beggar was tearing at my clothes, pulling at my chest.

I scrambled backward, my hand finding a stone. I nervously scanned my surroundings.

“Get away! All of you, get away from me!”

The beggar laughed, showing his yellowed teeth, and quickly snatched the stone from my hand.

“Don’t struggle. Let us brothers take good care of you.”

My whole body felt weak. I suddenly kicked the man off me, grabbed the stone, and aimed it fiercely at my wrist, where my main artery was.

I bit the inside of my cheek, forcing myself to stay awake.

“If you dare come any closer, I’ll kill myself!”

“If this gets big, the police won’t let you go. And Julian will make sure all of you pay for this.”

Perhaps my threatening aura intimidated them, as they hesitated and didn’t dare approach.

After all, I was wearing a diamond-studded dress and matching jewelry. I didn’t look like an ordinary person.

My whole body burned, and I groaned in discomfort.

Excruciating pain spread from my left hand. I stumbled and fell to my knees on the ground.

The beggars eyed me eagerly, slowly stepping closer again.

A few car horns honked from the bridge above. A pair of dark eyes stared down at me.

My pupils constricted. Like grasping at a last straw, I cried out for help, “Liam Knight, save me!”

In a matter of moments, Liam Knight’s bodyguards had thrown all the beggars into the lake and carried me into a car.

I leaned against the car window, my nostrils filled with the scent of cedarwood from Liam.

My breathing was heavy, and he immediately noticed something was wrong with me.

“Stella, what’s wrong?”

But as soon as his hand reached out, I grabbed it and pressed it against my cheek.

“Liam, I feel awful…”

His eyes turned cold. He lowered the partition, cutting off the bodyguards’ view. “To the hospital.”

My whole body was burning hot. I tore at my clothes, desperate for a sliver of coolness.

Liam Knight held my hands down and carefully poured mineral water into my mouth.

He was so cool and smelled so good. I instinctively nestled into his arms, my hands restlessly roaming.

“So hot, I feel awful…”

Liam Knight restrained my hands and urged his bodyguards to speed up.

My mind slowly cleared. I stared at the needle in the back of my hand.

The nurse gently put a cast on my left hand, a sympathetic look on her face. “How did the patient get hurt so badly?”

My heart ached. Julian Thorne kissing these very hands suddenly flashed through my mind.

Julian Thorne loved to hear me play the piano more than anything.

Every time a song ended, he would gallantly kiss my hands, caressing my knuckles, unable to let go.

“Stella’s hands are the most beautiful I’ve ever seen.”

“They’ll look even better when they wear the ring I designed myself.”

I snapped back to reality and asked, full of hope,

“Nurse, can I still play the piano?”

She shook her head regretfully. “Forget playing the piano. If it doesn’t heal well, you won’t even be able to pick things up in the future.”

My phone chimed. It seemed Julian Thorne had finally remembered me.

I unlocked my phone, and a video popped up.

Julian Thorne passionately kissed Amber White’s lips, tearing her clothes to shreds.

Their naked bodies intertwined, the sounds of their intimate gasps echoing.

“Amber, I truly love you so much.”

“You’re finally back in the country. I’ve missed you so much. I can’t live without you.”

“I waited for you for six whole years only to realize that no one can replace you.”

Amber sensually clawed at Julian Thorne’s back, then triumphantly looked directly at the camera.

She asked in a sweet, cooing voice, “Did you treat Stella as my replacement, that’s why you pampered her so much?”

The man nodded without hesitation, sealing her words with another kiss.
