Like a madwoman, I struggled fiercely to break free from Julian Thorne’s grasp, but then I heard his subtle threat.

“Don’t forget, the cemetery where your parents are buried is currently up for bidding.”

“If you don’t behave, I can’t guarantee they’ll rest in peace.”

The day my parents were buried, Julian Thorne had tenderly held me, promising sincerely:

“Stella, I’ll take good care of you in your parents’ stead.”

“You still have me; you can still rely on me.”

Julian Thorne used to accompany me to the cemetery every year to pay respects to my parents, referring to himself as my husband in front of their tombstone.

“Don’t worry, elders. I will protect Stella for life and make her the happiest woman in the world.”

The familiar face was now utterly foreign. My tears flowed freely.

Amber White softly pushed the agreement towards me, her eyes filled with greed.

“Stella, as long as you sign, I’ll disappear from your sight immediately.”

“I promise, I’ll never bother you and Julian again.”

But the next second, she quickly rushed into the bathroom and dry-heaved violently.

Julian Thorne glared fiercely at me, then yelled at the butler.

“What are you waiting for? Call the family doctor!”

My health was never good; I was always battling some illness or another.

So Julian Thorne had hired a family doctor at a high cost, on call for me twenty-four hours a day.

The doctor rushed over, panicked when he saw my body covered in red rashes, and frantically rummaged through his medical bag.

But Julian Thorne stormed over, completely losing his composure.

“Can’t you see Amber is in pain?!”

“Get over here now!”

The doctor looked at me helplessly, but I shook my head, my nails digging deep into my flesh, drawing blood.

In those brief minutes, the doctor cast a sympathetic glance at me, then congratulated Amber White.

“Ms. White, you’re… positive pregnancy!”

I felt like I’d been struck by lightning, unable to move. I mechanically repeated the doctor’s words.

“Positive pregnancy?”

Julian Thorne’s face lit up with joy. He cupped Amber White’s face and kissed her, their noses touching.

“Amber, this is our child.”

Amber White knelt down in front of me with a thud, crying tears of regret.

“Stella, it’s not that I want to take things from you.”

“Julian and I were both drunk that night. It’s all my fault for not pushing him away.”

She desperately kowtowed, begging me not to be angry with her, claiming the child was innocent.

Julian Thorne almost always stayed by my side until I fell asleep, except for the night Amber White returned to the country.

That night was also my twentieth birthday.

After Julian Thorne placed a tiara on my head, he reluctantly told me that something had come up at the company, requiring his immediate attention.

He left in a hurry, but when he returned, he was covered in a woman’s sickly sweet perfume.

“Stella, I accidentally got it on me during a business dinner.”

“You know, you’re the only one in my heart.”

I looked at Amber White’s face, identical to mine, and understood everything.

The atmosphere around me dropped. I slapped Amber White hard across the face.

Immediately after, a burning sting appeared on my own cheek.

“Stella, you’re being utterly unreasonable!”

“Amber was generous enough to leave you the position of Mrs. Thorne!”

I clutched my swollen face and sneered. “Julian Thorne, do you now expect me to be grateful to her and hand over everything with both hands?”

“Dream on!”

Julian Thorne’s face was ashen. He clenched his jaw, looking at the butler.

“Take Ms. White to the attic! She’s become increasingly unruly and ill-mannered!”

My body felt weak, and I was dragged by bodyguards, my hands pinned, utterly unable to resist.

But the next second, the tightly shut front door was violently kicked open.

A low male voice resonated. “Who dares lay a hand on my fiancée?”


Liam Knight’s bodyguards rescued me. I collapsed into his arms, accidentally pressing on my bandaged left hand.

“It hurts.”
