"What was your name again? How long have you been here?"
Mr. Evans didn't even look up from his desk.
Ten years.
I had been with this company for ten years.
"Lynn," I said. "Ten years."
"Ah." He shuffled some papers. "The company's downsizing. Your position is… expendable. You understand."
Expendable.
I almost laughed.
"Fine," I said. "I'll submit my resignation today."
Mr. Evans blinked, surprised I'd agreed so quickly.
"Well… get everything handed over by the end of the week, then."
"Okay."
I turned and walked out. I paused at the door.
"Mr. Evans, do you have any idea how many systems this company runs on?"
He frowned. "What's that supposed to mean?"
I didn't turn around.
"Nothing. I won't keep you."

1
My name is Lynn. I'm thirty-five, and I've worked at this company for exactly ten years.
Ten years.
It sounds ridiculous even to me.
When I joined back in 2014, we were just a tiny startup with a team of twenty. I was twenty-four, fresh out of college, clueless about everything except how to work my tail off.
I built our systems from the ground up.
It started with a simple inventory management tool. Then, slowly, I added more. The order management system, the financial system, the supply chain logistics, the CRM…
Ten years. Forty-seven systems.
The admin account and password for every single one of them are stored in my head.
No one ever asked me for them.
And I never volunteered them.
It wasn't that I was being secretive. It was that, genuinely, no one ever asked.
In this company, I was invisible.
How invisible?
Today, when the big boss called me in for a chat, his first words were, "What was your name again?"
Ten years.
He didn't know my name.
Honestly, I should have been used to it.
Back when I started, the company was small, less formal. If work needed doing, you did it. Nobody cared who you were. But as we grew, we moved offices three times, expanding from twenty people to over two hundred.
And I was still just "the one who does the work."
I was never invited to the important meetings.
I was never included in team-building events.
At the annual awards ceremony, they'd call out names from sales, marketing, and operations.
And IT?
"A big thank you to our colleagues in the IT department."
That was it. One line. Not a single name.
I'd stopped caring. As long as the paycheck came on time and the work got done, it was fine.
Until two months ago.
We got a new hire. Amber. Twenty-four years old, a Master's in computer science from a top university.
HR led her to the desk next to mine. "Lynn, this is Amber. She's new. Could you show her the ropes?"
I nodded. Sure. It wasn't the first time.
Then I saw her offer letter with the salary.
$15,000 a month.
I froze.
Me, with ten years of service, made $8,000 a month.
Her, a fresh graduate, was starting at $15,000.
"Is something wrong?" Amber asked, noticing my expression.
"No, nothing," I said. "Let me walk you through the systems."
I couldn't sleep that night.
It wasn't anger. It was a strange, hollow feeling. Like a wound I’d kept covered for years had been suddenly ripped open.
So this was what I was worth to this company.
No, I wasn't even worth that.
The next morning, I got a call.
A headhunter.
"Ms. Miller? Hello, I'm from a recruitment agency. I'm calling about a Lead DevOps Engineer position at a major tech firm. The starting salary is $24,000 a month. Would you be interested in discussing it?"
I was stunned silent for a few seconds.
"How did you find me?"
"You posted a few technical articles on an industry forum. They were incredibly insightful. Our client specifically requested we find someone with your profile."
The industry forum.
I'd written those three years ago.
I never thought anyone had noticed.
"I'll have to think about it."
"Of course. Please let me know."
I hung up and looked around the bustling office.
Not a single person glanced my way.
It was like I was made of air.
In that moment, I made a decision.

Amber adapted quickly.
It’s almost ironic to say it like that.
Because "adapting" meant she learned how to perform for the bosses.
"Good morning, Mr. Evans!"
"Mr. Miller, have you had lunch yet?"
"Sarah, I love that dress on you!"
She was a sweet talker, all smiles and compliments, and always ready to run an errand. The complete opposite of me.
Her desk was next to mine. The first thing she did every morning was her makeup. Then she'd scroll through her phone, chat on social media, and browse online stores.
And her work?
"Lynn, how do you run this report? Can you show me?"
"Lynn, how do I log into this system? What's the password?"
"Lynn, this…"
Lynn, Lynn, Lynn. She said it so sweetly.
After training her for three days, I realized something.
She didn't know a thing.
I'm not exaggerating. She was genuinely clueless. A Master's from a top university who couldn't even write a clean SQL query.
"This wasn't my area of research," she'd said, completely unabashed. "My focus is on AI."
An AI specialist doing IT operations?
I didn't say anything. A job was a job. I'd teach her what she needed to know.
But there was one thing I didn't teach her.
The passwords.
The admin passwords to all forty-seven systems. I didn't give her a single one.
She asked once.
"Lynn, what are the admin passwords for all these systems? I should write them down."
"It's a lot to remember. Just use a standard user account for now."
"Oh, okay."
She never asked again.
And I never brought it up.
It wasn't that I was deliberately hiding them. It was that nobody cared. In ten years, no one besides me knew those passwords.
And no one had ever wanted to know.
When the systems are running smoothly, who cares who's maintaining them behind the scenes?
It's like air.
You breathe it, but you never thank it.
Not until the day it's gone.
A week later, Amber was handling simple issues on her own.
I overheard her chatting with a colleague in the breakroom.
"Honestly, I think the system architecture here is pretty clunky. If I had designed it, it would be much more efficient."
The colleague asked, "Didn't Lynn build that system?"
"Yeah, but you know how it is with long-term employees. Their tech gets a little outdated. I mean, everyone's using cloud-native and microservices now. Her whole setup is ancient."
I was standing right outside the door. I didn't make a sound.
Ancient.
Alright, then.
Let's see how well you handle something so "ancient."

In early December, a company-wide email went out.
"Notification of Organizational Restructuring."
It was a pretty way of saying "layoffs."
The IT department was first on the chopping block.
My manager, Mr. Miller, gathered us in a conference room.
"The company's profits have been down the last couple of years, so we have to trim the fat. The IT department needs to let two people go."
Everyone exchanged nervous glances.
I already knew.
Sure enough, his eyes landed on me.
"Lynn, you're a veteran employee, so I'll be direct. The company feels… your position can be optimized."
"What does that mean?"
"It means…" He cleared his throat. "Amber has been performing very well since she arrived. She can handle most of the workload now. As for you…"
He trailed off, but the message was crystal clear.
If the new girl can do the job, we don't need the old-timer.
"Mr. Miller," I said, looking him straight in the eye, "these systems have run without a single major failure for ten years. Whose work is that a credit to?"
He smirked. "The system's stability is a credit to the leadership's direction. You're just maintenance. What credit is there to take?"
I was speechless.
Not because his words were so insulting.
But because I suddenly realized that after ten years, this was how they saw me.
"Just maintenance."
The one who does the work.
Expendable.
"Fine," I said, standing up. "I understand."
"So, you'll…"
"I'm going to talk to Mr. Evans right now."
"About what?"
"About my resignation."
Mr. Miller stared, stunned.
I didn't wait for him. I walked straight to Mr. Evans's office.
And that brings us back to the beginning.
"What was your name again? How long have you been here?"
Ten years.
And you're asking me how long I've been here.
When I walked out of his office, Amber was walking back with a cup of coffee.
"Lynn, what did you need to see Mr. Evans about?"
"I'm quitting."
Her eyes lit up for a split second before she masked it with concern.
"Oh, Lynn, don't be impulsive! It's tough to find a job out there."
I smiled faintly. "Thanks for your concern."
"But if you leave, what about all these systems?"
"You're the one who said they were poorly designed. Here's your chance to rebuild them."
Her face flushed.
"Lynn, I didn't mean it like that…"
"It's fine," I said. "I'll leave you all the documentation."
What I didn't say was:
The documentation doesn't have the passwords.

The news spread like wildfire.
"Did you hear? Lynn is leaving."
"Yeah, I heard Mr. Evans let her go personally."
"After ten years? Just like that?"
"Well, you know, the company has to downsize."
"True. Her job was pretty non-essential anyway."
Expendable. Non-essential.
I must have heard those words a dozen times in the last two days.
I packed my desk while colleagues walked past without a word. It was as if I was already gone.
Sarah from HR came over with a document.
"Lynn, this is your separation agreement. You just need to sign here."
I glanced at it.
"Where's the severance pay?"
"What severance pay?"
"I've worked here for ten years. According to labor laws, I'm entitled to a severance package."
Sarah looked flustered. "Well… the company's position is that you resigned voluntarily. This isn't a layoff."
I looked at her.
"Sarah, I have a recording."
Her face went pale.
"Mr. Evans himself told me the company was 'downsizing' and my position was 'expendable.' That is, by definition, a layoff, not a voluntary resignation."
"You… you recorded him?"
"Ten years," I said with a thin smile. "You pick up a few things."
Sarah took the papers and left.
Thirty minutes later, she was back with a new agreement.
The full severance package. Not a penny missing.
I signed it.
Amber watched from her desk, hesitating.
"Lynn…"
"What is it?"
"The passwords for the systems… could you… give me a copy?"
I stared at her.
"I thought my setup was ancient."
"That's not what I meant…"
"It's fine." I stood up. "The documentation is on the shared drive. You can find it there."
What I didn't say was:
The documents only contain operating procedures. Not a single password.
If someone had asked for them, I would have given them.
But no one asked. Why should I volunteer?
Ten years, and no one asked.
So don't blame me for not giving.
I packed the last of my things and took one final look at my desk. The armrests of the chair, worn smooth from a decade of use. The partition covered in sticky notes. The little plant that somehow survived even when no one remembered to water it.
"Lynn."
I turned. It was Mr. Miller.
"Are you really leaving?"
"The papers are signed."
"I mean…" He lowered his voice. "You should probably hand over those passwords before you go."
I laughed.
"But Manager, didn't you say I was 'just maintenance'? Now that the maintenance person is gone, I'm sure the systems will run themselves."
His face darkened.
"Don't play games, Lynn. This is serious."
"I'm not playing." I picked up my box. "My handover period is one week. The documentation is all there. The passwords?"
I paused.
"In ten years, you never once asked for them."
I didn't wait for his reply. I walked out.
I heard his voice behind me.
"Good riddance! Frees up a seat for someone who'll actually do some work!"
I didn't look back.
