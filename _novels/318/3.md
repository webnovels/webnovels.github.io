Sierra touched the jade pendant with an envious expression. "It's truly beautiful, Chloe. You're so lucky to have such a loving family."

Chloe was pleased by her words, the smile on her face growing even more smug.

"Of course. After all, the entire Sterling family depends on my life."

The moment she finished speaking, she saw me standing at the doorway. The smile on her face instantly froze.

Sierra was also startled, quickly standing up and looking at me uneasily.

"Give me back my things." I held out my hand.

Chloe snapped back to reality, immediately putting on a tearful expression, clutching the jade pendant tightly to her chest.

"Sister, I just… I just wanted to borrow it, to get some of Mom's good fortune, to bless my surgery…"

She cried, looking towards Julian, who had rushed over. "Julian, please, tell my sister, I didn't mean to take her things…"

Julian immediately stood in front of Chloe, frowning at me.

"Aurora, it's just a jade pendant, isn't it? Do you have to make such a fuss? She's about to have surgery, can't you just let her be at peace?"

"I'll say it again," I stared intensely at the hypocritical face behind him. "Give me back my property."

"You!" Julian was enraged by my attitude. "How can you be so unreasonable!"

He reached out to grab my wrist, but I dodged him.

In the struggle, Chloe shrieked, "Ah!" and fell backward.

The jade pendant she was clutching to her chest flew out of her hand, then hit the marble floor with a loud "CRACK."

It shattered into several pieces.

Chloe looked at the fragments on the floor and let out a piercing wail.

Julian spun around, saw the broken jade pendant, and violently shoved me away.

"Aurora! Are you happy now?!"

I stumbled back a few steps, my lower back hitting the doorframe hard.

Just then, my father, Robert Sterling, rushed over, drawn by the noise, and saw the mess on the floor.

He saw Chloe, who was crying herself almost to unconsciousness, and the broken jade pendant on the floor. Without a word, he raised his hand and gave me a resounding slap across the face.

"You unruly brat! Apologize to your sister!"

My face burned with pain, my ears ringing.

I looked at the three faces before me and suddenly smiled.

"Alright."

I bent down, picked up the largest piece of the shattered jade, then walked to Chloe.

"I'm sorry."

As I spoke, I suddenly raised my hand.
