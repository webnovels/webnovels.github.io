Chloe's tears flowed freely, and she leaned weakly against Julian.

"It's all my fault. If it weren't for my weak body, you wouldn't have to suffer so much."

Julian tenderly supported her, his gaze at me tinged with reproach.

"Aurora, your sister isn't well. Can't you just be more understanding with her?"

In the past, I would have softened and apologized immediately.

I shook off his hand, my gaze coldly sweeping over both of them.

"Something you need?"

Chloe bit her lip, walking towards me.

"Sister, that heirloom jade pendant Mom left you, I heard it has a soothing, healing effect. Could I borrow it for a few days? You know my illness, I'm always anxious. If I wear it, maybe I can get some good sleep."

That blood-red jade pendant, smooth and warm to the touch, with a subtle crimson glow within – it was my mother's only keepsake.

"No." I refused coldly.

Chloe's face drained of all color.

"Sister, are you still blaming me? Blaming me for taking your blood, your bone marrow…" She choked on her sobs. "But I didn't want to either… Julian, I… I feel so dizzy…"

Her body went limp, and she swayed into Julian's arms.

Julian immediately held her, anxiously checking her condition, then looked up and glared at me.

"Aurora! Do you have to provoke your sister like this?! She's about to undergo surgery! Can't you be more sensible?"

I scoffed.

"Sensible? Does that mean I have to give her my life to be 'sensible'?"

I turned and walked away, not bothering to watch their act any longer.

Back in my room, I immediately started searching.

Dressing table, jewelry box, wardrobe…

Nowhere.

That blood-red jade pendant was gone.

I rushed out of the room and grabbed a maid.

"Where's the jade pendant from my room?"

The maid stammered, "Miss Aurora… Miss Chloe said… said you agreed, and she took it to wear for a few days…"

All the blood in my body instantly rushed to my head.

My 'good sister,' indeed.

She didn't even bother to pretend anymore, she just took it.

I kicked open Chloe's bedroom door.

She was sitting on the sofa, showing off my blood-red jade pendant to Sierra Maxwell, who had come to visit her.

"Sierra, look, this is what my mom left me, isn't it beautiful? My sister treasures it the most, but the moment I asked, she still obediently gave it to me."
