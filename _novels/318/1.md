The man in the photo was Hunter Thorne, with sharp eyes and a fierce gaze. He was the capital's newest business magnate, and also the Sterling family's sworn enemy in business.

My father was stunned. "Aurora, what are you playing at? You've always liked Dr. Hayes, haven't you?"

I squeezed my hands tightly, the pain keeping me grounded.

Julian Hayes, a highly respected and compassionate attending physician, who had always been so caring and gentle towards me.

In my past life, that very gentleness was what dragged me to hell.

"Him."

My father frowned, his eyes filled with disdain.

"Aurora, don't act like a child. Who is Hunter Thorne? Some unknown nobody who appeared out of nowhere, does he really think he's good enough to marry into the Sterling family?"

He picked up the eight résumés, pulled Julian's out, and pushed it towards me.

"Dr. Hayes comes from a good family, he's been devoted to your sister, and he's always been patient with you. He's the best choice."

Oh yes, so good that he personally drained my blood to save his beloved.

I met my father's impatient gaze.

"I choose Hunter Thorne."

My father's face darkened completely. He slammed the résumés onto the table.

"Are you deliberately trying to defy me? Fine, I'll tell you, forget about it! Hunter Thorne can't beat me. His company is on the verge of bankruptcy, and he's practically dying, stuck in some isolated hospice, just waiting to die!"

My father's assistant knocked on the door and entered at just the right moment, whispering a few words in his ear.

After listening, my father revealed a cruel sneer.

"Did you hear that? He checked into a private hospice last month, suffering from an incurable disease. Even the doctors gave up on him. You want to pick a dying man? Do you want to be a widow right away?"

"I'm not choosing anyone." I abruptly stood up, my heart seizing in my chest.

As I walked out of the study, a hand suddenly grabbed my wrist.

I turned around. It was Julian Hayes.

He was wearing a white lab coat, his eyes behind the gold-rimmed glasses as gentle as ever.

"Aurora, your sister said she wants to see you."

Behind him stood my 'good sister,' Chloe Sterling.

She was dressed in a pristine white hospital gown, her face pale, her body so frail it seemed a gust of wind could blow her over.

She looked at me timidly, her eyes reddening. "Sister, don't be mad at Dad…"
