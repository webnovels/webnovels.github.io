Thirty minutes before the private jet was scheduled to land, the air suddenly grew turbulent.

The red wine in Damian's hand sloshed, and the deep crimson liquid spilled down the side of the glass onto his custom-tailored trousers.

His fiancée, Tiffany, gasped, recoiling with a look of distaste. She pointed at me, snapping, "Are you completely incompetent? Can't even hold a glass steady? Hurry up and clean it for Damian!"

I immediately knelt on the thick leather carpet, a warm towel in hand. My head bowed, my trembling fingers reached towards the legs of the man I'd once spent countless nights with.

A soft, contemptuous chuckle came from above me.

The next second, his icy fingers pinched my chin, forcing me to look up.

"Crystal, you used to be so high and mighty. Now, for money, you've certainly mastered the art of kneeling."

I lowered my gaze, avoiding his scrutinizing stare. "Damian, I'll cover the cleaning fee for your trousers, of course."

"Cleaning fee?"

He slowly unbuckled his belt. "Since it's my private jet, my rules go."

He leaned in close to my ear, his voice low, a demonic whisper. "You weren't cleaning pants when you were in this position before."
