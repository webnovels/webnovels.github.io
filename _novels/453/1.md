The pretty and pure-looking girl introduced herself at the front of the classroom.
Almost all the boys were staring at her.
Except for Ryan White.
He was napping on his desk, barely lifting an eyelid to glance at her, his expression unchanged.

The teacher assigned Olivia to sit next to a chubby boy who was leering at her.
Olivia clutched her backpack and walked towards the empty seat next to Ryan, saying softly:
"Excuse me, can I sit here?"

Someone gasped.
The last girl who tried to sit next to Ryan was pursuing him.
Ryan had sneered at her then, spitting out one word: "Scram."

But now.
Under Olivia's pleading gaze.
Ryan's Adam's apple bobbed, and he said lazily: "Whatever."

Olivia breathed a sigh of relief and carefully sat down.
I sat right in front of Ryan.
All day long.
I listened as Olivia actively tried to befriend Ryan, showing him her notes, sharing snacks with him.
Ryan went from initially rejecting her in annoyance to gradually allowing it.

I suddenly had a bad feeling.
Day after day I listened to the interactions behind me.
Even when studying, I couldn't help but be distracted.

Olivia said to Ryan: "This chapter is really important, don't fall asleep!"
I thought Ryan would refuse, but a few seconds later, I heard him say:
"If it's so important, then explain it to me."

My hand trembled.
The pen tip left a deep mark.
Ruining the study notes I had taken all day.

When Ryan asked me to buy two breakfasts instead of one, I wasn't too surprised.
I only had a sense that it was inevitable.

Ryan formally asked a girl out for the first time.
Someone said: "Is all this really necessary? Is there any girl who could refuse our Ryan?"
"Our Ryan just has to crook his finger and the transfer student would come running."
Ryan kicked him, saying seriously: "She's different."

She really was different.
Because she rejected Ryan White.
She said: "Ryan, we're students, we should focus on our studies."
Ryan's face darkened.
But then, Olivia added: "After the SATs, I'll seriously consider your confession."
Ryan's expression immediately brightened: "Alright, I'll hold you to that."

From then on, Ryan really buckled down and started studying hard.
Delayed gratification makes people anticipate things more.
Though they weren't officially together, the tension between them was palpable.

He would call Olivia "little pear" and she would glare at him coyly.
He used his allowance to buy Olivia's three meals a day.
When Olivia tried to refuse, he said it would go to waste otherwise.
He would frequently give Olivia all kinds of gifts, and she repaid him by tutoring him.
They were so close, just short of officially dating.

I listened to their interactions behind me every day, gradually becoming numb to it.
The SATs came quickly.
But right at that crucial time, something happened with Olivia's family.
Her father somehow heard about her and Ryan, beat her up, and tried to extort money from Ryan.
Ryan got Olivia's call and left 10 minutes before the exam started.

The result was -
Ryan missed the SATs to protect Olivia, and even broke his leg.
With things blowing up like that, when Mrs. White asked me, I could only tell her the truth.
Ryan was confined to the house.
When I went to bring him food, he lifted the soup bowl and poured it over my head.
"Lily Spring, you didn't really think you were my foster sister, did you? Going to tattle to my mom like that."
"You disgust me."

The soup dripped down steadily.
I stood there covered in vegetables, silently looking at Ryan.
My birth name was Xue Panmei. Mrs. White was the one who took me to change it to Lily.
Mrs. White had shown me kindness. I didn't mind taking the fall for the sake of her relationship with her son.

The day the SAT scores came out.
The White family decided to send Ryan abroad.
Mrs. White looked at me: "Lily, do you want to go abroad with Ryan?"
"I know you did well on your SATs, but studying abroad is an option too. You two can look out for each other."

Look out for each other?
From childhood, I was always the one taking care of Ryan.
I heard the hidden meaning in Mrs. White's words.
Under Mrs. White's expectant gaze.
I said: "Okay."

Ryan sneered and went back to his room.
While packing, he passed by me and said: "Lily Spring, you really are shameless, insisting on following me."
I denied it, saying I just wanted to experience life abroad too.
