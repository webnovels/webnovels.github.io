Ryan didn't believe my explanation.
The night before leaving.
I overheard Ryan on the phone with Olivia saying:
"I don't blame you, I've never blamed you, it wasn't your fault."
"Little pear, you can't choose what family you're born into."
The crying on the other end of the line wouldn't stop.

Soon, I watched him sneak out over the wall, his figure disappearing into the night.
Mrs. White heard a noise and came out, asking if someone had opened the door.
She was about to go check Ryan's room when I came out from around the corner, saying: "It was me, Mrs. White. I got up to get some water."

Early the next morning.
Ryan still hadn't returned.
I called him several times but got no answer, then his phone was turned off.
Things were about to be discovered.
I could only put on a poor acting performance, bursting into tears on the spot.
I cried about my fears of going abroad.
Mrs. White's attention was indeed drawn to me.
She comforted me saying: "It's alright, Lily. You'll have Ryan with you."
"You've always liked him, haven't you?"
"Maybe this is a chance for you two to get together."

So Mrs. White had seen through me long ago.
I nodded obediently, my mind still on buying time.
But just then, I heard a scornful laugh.
Ryan had returned at some point, standing there looking at me with disdain.
