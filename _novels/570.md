The Inferno Apocalypse was coming. Working as a climate scientist, I'd detected anomalies and urged my family to prepare.

My parents, Brenda and Robert Smith, seemed to trust my judgment. They even proposed creating a "Family Survival Fund."

They told me to pour my years of savings into stockpiling supplies, promising they and my younger brother, Leo, would contribute all their money too. We would survive this, together.

I smiled. "Alright, I'll handle the planning."

That very night, I converted every single penny of the fund into gold bullion and locked it in a safe. I also spent a fortune building a state-of-the-art apocalypse shelter.

The day the apocalypse struck, they came to demand the money we'd supposedly saved together.

"Hand over all the gold. You're just an outsider anyway, a waste of precious resources."

I smiled, tossing them the safe containing the gold, and sealed them outside the shelter.

Their faces lit up with greedy delight as they opened the safe. Then, their smiles froze.
