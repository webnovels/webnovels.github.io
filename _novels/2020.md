I was on the long flight home from Tulum, scrolling through my feed, when I saw the two live photos my husband had posted. Declan never posted on social media. Never.
I tapped one of the photos open. A woman’s cloyingly sweet voice—the kind that stuck to the back of your throat—lilted in the background.
“Oh, Declan, thank you for taking me to such a fancy restaurant.”
I heard my husband’s low, soft chuckle.
“Whatever makes you happy.”
I froze for a few seconds, the sound echoing in the luxury cabin.
Then, I double-tapped the screen.
Liked by Ada Wells.
The post vanished less than a second later.
I smiled, a cold, brittle thing that didn't reach my eyes, and dialed his number.

1.
“Baby?” Declan’s voice, now back to its familiar, gentle cadence, answered instantly.
My eyes were dead calm.
“Declan Finch,” I said, my voice as flat as the runway I was about to land on. “I don’t care where you are or what you’re doing. You have three minutes to be home and waiting for me.”
A beat of silence stretched, thick and suffocating.
Then, he simply said, “Understood.”
My black Maybach pulled into the circular driveway of our Beverly Hills villa.
I stepped out and walked straight into the house.
Declan met me in the foyer, a practiced smile on his face, reaching smoothly to take my designer travel bag and jacket.
“Welcome back, darling. How was the trip?”
I ignored him. I walked past, went to the custom bar, and poured myself a glass of water.
Only after draining the glass did I turn to face him, my gaze finally settling on his face.
“Explain.”
He paused, lowering my coat onto the nearby settee.
“There’s nothing to explain, Ada. As you’ve obviously seen, I’m seeing someone else.”
His admission—I’m seeing someone else—was delivered with the same casual tone he used to ask if I’d had lunch.
The air went silent.
I let out a single, incredulous laugh. “Declan Finch, do you even hear yourself right now?”
He looked at me, utterly devoid of panic, and said only one thing.
“Ada, I’m just exhausted.”
The two words landed like a blow to the chest.
Silence.
I picked up the heavy crystal ashtray from the marble console and hurled it at him.
He didn’t flinch.
It caught his temple. Blood instantly bloomed across his forehead.
I stared, my voice low and dangerous. “I’m giving you one chance. Say that again. Correctly.”
Declan slowly raised a hand, wiping the blood smear away from his brow.
He looked up at me, his eyes clouded with a chilling weariness.
“Ada, I’m genuinely exhausted from being with you.”
Exhausted?
He said he was exhausted? After ten years together?
My hands clenched into fists, my voice trembling. “Declan, we’ve been together since we were fifteen. Married for three years. You think this is some kind of—”
“I’m not kidding, Ada!” He cut me off, his eyes finally showing a flicker of pain, a deep, frustrated red. “For the last decade, every time you’ve been angry, I’m the one who groveled and begged, regardless of who was right.”
“You mentioned, once, that you loved that rare, high-altitude orchid, and I nearly died trying to retrieve it from the Himalayas for you. But when I came back, your focus was only on the flower and the story, not the man who was in the ER.”
“At Charles’s fundraising gala, I had one extra glass of champagne, and you publicly smashed the entire bottle on the floor in front of all my colleagues and walked out, without a second thought for my humiliation.”
“And a month ago, because I was busy working and missed our anniversary dinner, you showed up at the office and stormed into my board meeting, acting like a lunatic.”
Each sentence he spoke was steeped in bitter resentment.
He was bleeding, yet he was listing my sins, detailing his pain.
I couldn’t believe it. I wouldn’t.
The boy who, at fifteen, climbed the fence in a blizzard to buy me tampons. The young man who proposed to me in front of the whole university at eighteen. The husband who wept with choked-up emotion on our wedding day.
Now, every word was a stone thrown at me.
My eyes burned, and my body began to shake—from fury, or perhaps from hurt.
Declan wiped the blood from his cheek and continued, his voice softer now.
“Ada, the night you left the office after that meeting—that was the first time I didn’t immediately chase you down to apologize. I walked the docks alone all night, until dawn. That’s when she showed up.”
When he spoke of her, a gentle light touched his features.
“Her name is Sherry. She’s a nurse. She’s not gorgeous, but she’s kind and empathetic. She listened to me, like a therapist. She comforted me.”
“In the time we’ve spent together, she’s made me coffee, she brings me lunch, she reminds me to rest. Being with her, I realized for the first time that I could be taken care of. I learned that women don’t have to be like you.”
My eyes were bloodshot. “So, you love her?”
“Yes.” He nodded without hesitation. “Ada, I love her.”
“And me?” I lunged forward, grabbing his silk tie and jerking his face down to mine. “Declan Finch, what about me?”
He looked at me.
There was no love left in his eyes.
Panic, cold and sharp, finally pierced me.
I threw my arms around him, holding him tightly.
“Husband, please, don’t do this. Don’t say you love her. You love me. You only love me.”
I couldn’t let go of him. I couldn’t let ten years end like this.
But Declan didn’t melt into me like he always did.
Instead, he slowly, painstakingly, detached my hands, finger by painful finger.
I shook my head violently, tears blurring my vision.
His next words felt like a handful of needles plunged into my heart.
“Ada, if you want to blame someone, blame yourself. You pushed me away, little by little.”
He seemed to remember something.
“But don’t worry. You’ll still be Mrs. Finch. You’ll still be the wealthy socialite who can go wherever she wants, worry about nothing. But I will no longer be the Declan Finch who loved you.”
He picked up his jacket and walked toward the door.
“Declan!”
I ran after him and bit down on the skin of his neck, hard, channeling all my fury and panic into the pressure of my teeth.
He didn't move.
Only when I tasted the metallic tang of blood did I release him. I kept my grip on his arm. “If you walk out that door, don’t you ever think about coming back!”
Declan pulled his arm free. “I won’t.”
He left. He walked out and didn't look back.
I screamed after his retreating form.
“Declan Finch! I swear I will destroy her! I will not let her get away with this!”
2.
Sherry Jenkins.
A nurse. Thirty-five. Divorced. A full ten years older than Declan.
And a divorced woman.
I stared at the photos in my hand. Dark hair, round face, slightly sallow complexion. Utterly unremarkable. Plain.
This is who you fell for, Declan?
I squeezed the file in my hand until the paper crinkled, my eyes burning with a bloody shade of red.
The doorbell rang.
“Ma’am, Ms. Jenkins is here.”
I took a deep, shuddering breath.
My carefully sculpted, beautiful face was now an expressionless mask of icy scorn.
I turned back. The woman standing there was wearing simple, light blue scrubs.
I didn’t bother with pleasantries.
“What is your relationship with Declan?”
Sherry’s expression was calm, almost annoyingly serene. “Mr. Finch and I are just friends.”
“Friends?”
I scoffed, looking her up and down with open contempt.
“And what exactly do you think you are? That you’re worthy of being his ‘friend’?”
Sherry’s brow furrowed slightly. “Ms. Wells, I told you, we are friends. It’s not like you think I was trying to have—”
“Smack!”
Before she could finish, I slapped the entire file of investigation documents against her face.
“This is your ‘nothing’ relationship? This is your ‘friendship’?”
“Ms. Jenkins, you’re positively filthy. Sleeping with a man you call your ‘friend’.”
Sherry paused, absorbing the three rapid-fire insults, and then let out a light, mocking laugh. “Ms. Wells, I didn’t believe a word Declan said about you, but now that I’ve met you, I finally understand.”
I froze.
She continued, a triumphant gleam in her eye: “He said you were selfish, self-serving, jealous, and nothing but relentless tantrums. He said the ten years he spent with you were the biggest regret of his life. A total waste of time.”
No woman can hear her husband and his mistress casually dissect her character without reacting.
My nails dug into my palms, but I didn't even register the pain.
Sherry curled her lips into a smirk.
“Ada Wells, so what if I was with him? Declan’s heart belongs to me now. He treats me like gold. Do you honestly think throwing me out will bring him back to you?”
“He doesn’t love you anymore, Ada!” She emphasized the last phrase, spitting it out like a curse.
I suddenly laughed, the sound hollow. “Oh, really?”
I took a slow, deliberate step toward her, my face darkening.
“Then today, I’ll show you exactly what I can do.”
I gave a cold smile and clapped my hands once.
The door opened. Two of my security staff came in carrying a chair and a long, lacquered walking stick from the hallway.
Sherry’s eyes widened. “What are you doing?”
I curled my red lips. “Showing you how I deal with trash.”
“Get her!”
The guards immediately grabbed her arms and quickly strapped her into the chair.
Sherry struggled wildly. “Ada, let me go! If Declan finds out, he will never forgive you!”
Hearing Declan’s name only stoked my fury.
I snatched the heavy stick from the guard and brought it down on her body.
“Ah!”
Sherry screamed in pain.
My eyes were scarlet with rage, and I kept striking her, again and again.
“You have no right to threaten me!”
“Filth is always filth! Did you think you were some kind of savior?”
“Even if Declan were standing here, I would still beat you!”
It only stopped when Sherry was unconscious and slumped over the ropes.
I threw the stick down and issued a final, cold command. “Take her. Dump her right in front of the entrance to the Finch corporate tower.”
When the horrible, chaotic scene was finally over.
My hands were shaking violently, refusing to steady.
I curled up on the sofa, my face pale.
I waited from day into night.
I didn't move from that position.
I wanted, more than anything, to know what Declan’s face would look like when he saw his mistress.
Suddenly, the front door was kicked open.
I lifted my head.
Declan stood in the doorway, wearing a black trench coat, his face a mask of violent fury.
My heart fluttered. I shifted my numb body, managing a weak smile. “Come to avenge your little mistress?”
That was all it took.
He rushed forward, his bloodshot eyes blazing, and seized my throat.
“Ada Wells! Who gave you the right to touch her?!”
“Did you really think I was soft?”
“Did you think I wouldn’t hurt you?”
Three ice-cold questions crushed the air from my lungs.
I wasn’t sure if the choking pain was from his grip or my broken heart.
But I glared at him and forced the words out. “I did touch her. And you can just go to h—Ah!”
He abruptly lifted me and shoved me away.
My back slammed into the solid wall. The impact felt like it shattered my ribs.
Declan walked toward me, step by heavy step, his eyes burning red.
“Ada, did you know Sherry was pregnant with my child?”
3.
A child?
I snapped my head up.
Ignoring the blinding pain in my back, I scrambled up and lunged, grabbing his tie with both hands.
“What did you say?”
“Declan, what the hell did you just say?”
When I was twenty, I had an accidental pregnancy.
I’d run to him, ecstatic.
But he told me he hated the idea of children because of his own troubled childhood, and that he wanted us to be child-free.
I was heartbroken, but I agreed. I went through with the procedure.
Later, I even voluntarily underwent a tubal ligation—I got my tubes tied—to ensure I wouldn't pressure him again.
And now?
Now he was telling me he’d gotten her pregnant?
“You heard me!”
Declan shoved me back, screaming at me. “It wasn’t that I hated children! I just hated the idea of you giving birth to my children!”
“You’re selfish, jealous, and cruel! One of you is enough! I didn’t want a second one!”
I froze in place.
His eyes were still red. “Ada, if you had a problem, you should have come after me! Why go after Sherry?”
“Do you know how long I’ve been waiting for that child?!”
“You killed my child—my child with Sherry—and I swear I will make you pay.”
“Guards!”
Declan’s voice was arctic as he gave the command to my staff.
“However many times she struck Sherry, double it. Apply the beating to her.”
The guards immediately came forward and held my arms.
My eyes instantly went bloodshot. “Declan Finch, you touch me and my parents will end you!”
He spun back, marched toward me, and clamped his hand hard around my jaw.
“Look at yourself, Ada! Look! You’re nothing but an expensive parasite, a spoiled leech who only knows how to consume the people around you and depend on others.”
“Without me, without your parents, you are trash!”
“A person like you, if you weren’t rich, would be doing the most disgusting, low-class things imaginable!”
With that, he let go of my face and turned to walk out.
I recovered, my eyes locked on his retreating back.
I didn't say another word.
I took all thirty strikes without a sound.
Until I coughed up blood and finally passed out.
The first thing I did when I woke up was ask the nurse's station for Sherry Jenkins’s room number.
I walked to the door and kicked it open.
When I saw the scene inside, I couldn’t stop my fists from clenching.
They hadn't noticed me yet.
Naked, intertwined on the hospital bed.
Declan’s voice was husky and low. “Sherry, please give me another child. I promise I’ll protect you both this time.”
“I’m so sorry. I didn’t protect you this time. But I swear, it won’t happen again.”
I let out a low, cold laugh.
I stood in the doorway, clapping my hands sharply.
“Everyone! Come quick! We have a live show! Starring the Pediatric Nurse, Sherry Jenkins, and my husband, CEO Declan Finch!”
4.
Medical staff immediately rushed over from the hallway.
When they saw the tableau inside, people started pulling out their phones.
The two entangled figures on the bed froze instantly.
“Ah!”
Sherry screamed and buried herself desperately in Declan’s arms.
Declan saw me.
His face turned to stone.
He snatched the sheet and pulled it over Sherry.
His clothes were scattered on the floor. Declan tried to cover himself and grab his shirt.
I was faster. I kicked his shirt right out the door and into the hallway.
Declan ground his teeth, incandescent with rage.
“Ada Wells! What the hell are you doing?!”
I ignored him. I walked to the bed and yanked the sheet right off Sherry.
“Ah!”
Her naked body was exposed to everyone.
She dissolved into tears, trying to hide behind Declan.
“Ada!” His eyes were spitting fire.
I smiled at the gawking staff. “That’s Sherry Jenkins, everyone! Your Pediatric Nurse! Did you all get a good look?”
“It really is Sherry.”
“Holy cow, she’s divorced, right? How did she hook up with Declan Finch, the CEO of the Finch Group?”
“I know! She’s not even that pretty, and I hear the Peds nurses say she has a terrible attitude. How did she do it?”
“Tsk tsk. That’s the wife right there. Leaving a beauty like that for her?”
“Haven’t you heard? The grass is always greener…”
Sherry kept weeping and hiding behind Declan.
Declan’s face was dark. He roared at the crowd. “Get out! Now! Or I swear I’ll make sure none of you work in this city again!”
The crowd scattered, terrified. Declan Finch held sway in LA.
Only the three of us remained.
Declan stopped trying to cover himself, climbed out of bed, and quickly put on his clothes.
Before I could mock him, he lunged, his hand swinging out without hesitation.
“CRACK!”
The force of the slap whipped my head sideways.
“Ada Wells! Are you insane?!”
He suppressed his fury, grabbing a fistful of my hair and forcing my head back so I had to look at him.
The pain made my eyes water, but I didn't make a sound.
Declan didn't feel satisfied.
He shoved me toward Sherry.
“Apologize!”
Sherry was huddled in the corner, still sobbing dramatically.
My eyes were blazing red. “Go to hell. Never.”
At my refusal, Declan tightened his grip.
“Ada! Apologize! Don’t make me say it a third time!”
I bit down hard on my lip.
Sherry reached out a trembling hand and grabbed his arm. “Declan, it’s okay. Ms. Wells is right to be angry.”
Declan looked at her, then released me.
“If Sherry weren’t so kind, I—”
“AH!”
Before he could finish, I snatched Sherry by her hair and started slapping her, hard and fast.
“Oh, she’s kind! She’s lovely! She’s tender!”
“She makes you, Declan Finch, forget your own name! She makes you yearn for her every day! She makes you want to die for her!”
Declan seized my wrist, his rage reaching its peak.
“Ada, I think you really are—”
“CRACK!”
I cut him off with a slap across his face.
He was stunned. He hadn't expected me to hit him.
I used the moment to hit the other cheek.
“Declan Finch! You’re disgusting! You’re a hypocrite!”
“No wonder your parents hate you! No wonder you’re just the discarded son of the Finches! No wonder you’ll never measure up to your brother!”
“Ada Wells!”
Declan’s eyes turned a dangerous, bloody red, fixed on me. Those were the things he could never forgive.
I didn’t care. I mustered all my remaining strength and delivered a final, stinging slap.
“Declan Finch! Now, let me tell you precisely! It’s not you walking away from me! I, Ada Wells, am walking away from you!”
“Whoever wants the title of ‘Mrs. Finch’ can have it. I, Ada Wells, no longer need it!”
