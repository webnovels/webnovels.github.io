The car was parked in the open-air lot.

Wyatt told me to wait while he drove it over.

I felt a little guilty enjoying the ride, so I ran with him to the parking lot.

The rain was heavy, and it was windy too.

By the time I struggled to reach the car, I was soaked from head to toe.

Once inside, Wyatt rummaged for tissues.

I couldn't take my eyes off his drenched T-shirt.

"One, two…"

Two clean white tissues were offered to me. "What are you counting?"

"Abs…" I answered subconsciously, then immediately realized what I’d said.

Wyatt didn't seem embarrassed at all. Instead, he leaned his arm back.

His T-shirt clung to his body, clearly revealing a six-pack and two pink n*pples peeking through.

A perfectly sculpted body like something out of a comic book, paired with his handsome face.

I couldn’t control myself and swallowed hard.

A little embarrassing.

Wyatt’s lips curved into a smile. "Checking me out before you pay, is that fair?"

"What?"

Before I could react, Wyatt’s fingers pinched my chin, and he kissed me.

At first, it was just a gentle brush, a tentative touch of lips.

My hands were on Wyatt’s shoulders. I meant to push him away, but somehow, they ended up circling his neck instead.

Wyatt seemed encouraged. His tongue gently parted my lips, stealing all my breath.

The temperature inside the car instantly soared.

The single sip of alcohol I’d had earlier seemed to spread through my entire body, making my limbs go weak.

Wyatt’s kisses grew more aggressive, as if he wanted to devour me whole.

I let out a soft moan of discomfort.

I was suffocating. I still hadn't learned to breathe during a kiss.

After a long while, Wyatt finally took pity on me and pulled back slightly, but he didn't get up.

He leaned against my cheek, whispering in my ear: "Chloe, you really should see how beautiful you are right now."

His hot breath brushed my earlobe.

His muscular chest pressed tightly against my softness.

Making my body tremble from head to toe.

"Wyatt…"

My phone buzzed with continuous SnapChat notifications.

The intimate atmosphere in the car was instantly shattered.

I didn't even need to look to know my mom was bombing me with messages and voice notes again.

Wyatt pulled away from me, glanced at the screen, and asked, "Is it okay not to reply?"

I clutched my phone, embarrassed and furious, and pressed the power button, turning it off.

I’d been a good girl for twenty-something years. What if I let loose for one night?

The feeling just now was too good. I really wanted it to continue.

If Wyatt asked if I wanted him to take me home, how should I answer?

Would it be too forward to say I didn’t want to go home? But I really wanted to keep kissing…

Unknowingly, I started overthinking again.

Wyatt chuckled softly, then leaned in once more.

I closed my eyes, only to feel a cool sensation across my chest.

Huh?

He had pulled out my seatbelt and fastened it for me.

"To my place."

It wasn't a question.

Wyatt knew what I wanted at that moment.


A spacious penthouse in the city center.

With floor-to-ceiling windows and an entire wall dedicated to a wine collection.
