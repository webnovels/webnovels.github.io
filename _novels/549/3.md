The next day, Sunday, I made up an excuse to my mom and left the house.

Coincidentally, Starlight Aesthetics Clinic was right across from the coffee shop where I had my blind date yesterday.

Sitting in the consultation room, I felt a little nervous.

The nurse who led me in poured me a glass of water.

"Please wait a moment, ma'am. Dr. Wyatt will be in for your consultation shortly."

Perhaps seeing my tension, she tried to reassure me.

"Dr. Wyatt is excellent! He guarantees beautiful results wherever you go!"

Well, I don't need *that*… just make them smaller.

After waiting a bit longer, I heard footsteps outside the consultation room.

A handsome guy, easily six feet one, walked in wearing a white lab coat.

I was stunned.

He looked incredibly handsome, making even a lab coat look like a designer trench coat.

He paused when he saw me, a slight flicker of surprise in his eyes.

I awkwardly stood up, my face heating up.

It was the first time such a handsome man had stared at me, though his gaze was a little strange.

"Dr. Wyatt, hello. I’m here to consult about… breast reduction surgery."

I said the last four words barely above a whisper.

Dr. Wyatt snapped back to attention, a smile gracing his lips as he sat opposite me.

I froze for a moment; his smile was truly captivating.

If all my blind dates looked like him, that would be amazing.

Dr. Wyatt first looked over the personal information the nurse had filled out for me, then asked:

"Do you have a boyfriend?"

"Huh?" I stared at him in surprise. "Does that have anything to do with the surgery?"

Perhaps it was my imagination, but a hint of awkwardness flashed across Dr. Wyatt’s face.

"Just casual conversation. Let’s see, your request is to reduce your cup size to an A?"

I nodded, my voice a mosquito-like whisper. "No boyfriend. Yes, flat-chested would be best."

I was so envious of girls with smaller chests. Everything they wore looked so chic and sophisticated.

Unlike me, I looked plump in too many clothes and trashy in too few.

Dr. Wyatt looked thoughtful. "What’s your current cup size?"

My face instantly flared crimson.

"It might be… an E, I think… I’m not really sure…"

My bras were all randomly bought online; the same size could be loose or tight.

Dr. Wyatt's charming eyes twinkled. "Would you mind if I took some measurements?"

I felt myself flush from head to toe, unable to believe what I was hearing.

"C-can I… have a female doctor instead?"

Dr. Wyatt replied gently, "Breast reduction is a complex procedure, with high risks. If not done well, it can cause mammary gland damage. I wouldn't feel comfortable leaving it to anyone else."

I was startled. I mentally chanted, "It's professional. It’s for my health," and nodded in agreement.

He stepped outside and called a nurse in.

I secretly let out a sigh of relief.

So it wasn’t just the two of us for the examination.

Dr. Wyatt pulled back a curtain in the consultation room, gesturing for me to go inside.

"There’s a camera there, but this area is out of its view."

My legs were trembling with nerves as I shuffled in, taking tiny steps.

The nurse stayed outside the curtain and didn't follow me in.

A deep male voice resonated near my ear: "Please take off your top and unhook your bra."
