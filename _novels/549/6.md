That afternoon, Wyatt took me to a high-end department store.

A place I always passed but never dared to enter.

He picked out two dresses for me, one black, one white, both absolutely gorgeous.

I tried them on.

The dresses had tight waists, making my chest look even more voluminous.

The skirts flared slightly, revealing my legs, which were quite fair since I always wore long pants.

Standing in front of the mirror, I barely recognized myself.

I quietly said to Wyatt, "Department store mirrors are really something, huh? They have a built-in slimming effect."

Wyatt covered his forehead with a hand.

"The mirrors are normal. Trust my aesthetic judgment, I am a plastic surgeon, after all."

"I think both dresses look great on you. Which one do you like?"

I hesitated.

I was too embarrassed to tell him I had trouble making decisions.

Normally, when online shopping, I'd procrastinate until the minute before coupons expired before finally choosing.

Maybe I should just pick one randomly?

But the black one was more practical… the white one was more special…

Which one to choose?

Seeing I didn't answer, Wyatt made the decision for me.

"Let's get both. They're different styles anyway."

He pulled out his phone to pay, and I quickly stopped him.

"I’ll pay myself."

I checked the tag—five digits.

Two dresses would wipe out my savings.

It hurt a little.

Maybe I should just pick one?

While I was still stunned, Wyatt had already paid, picked up the bags, and motioned for me to follow.

It seemed treating decision-making paralysis just required money.

I looked at the reflective floor of the mall, thinking hard, but couldn’t figure it out.

What was Wyatt's angle?

I was so plain, so broke, so uninteresting…

Was I really worth him spending so much money?

Next, Wyatt took me to get my eyes checked and fitted me for daily disposable contact lenses.

Silicone hydrogel, apparently, also very expensive…

It was my first time wearing these, and I was clumsy.

Wyatt gently caressed my cheek with his fingers, helping me put them in.

The world was clearer than ever before.

Except everything seemed a little bigger.

I stared at the man’s Adam's apple, swallowing hard.

Wyatt looked at me with satisfaction.

"Your skin is beautiful; you don’t even need makeup. You’re a natural beauty."

My face flushed again, a little thrill going through me.

Maybe… I did have some good qualities?
