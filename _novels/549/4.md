I closed my eyes and did as I was told.

A sudden coolness spread across my chest.

Dr. Wyatt held a stiff ruler and a soft measuring tape, moving them across my chest.

My heart pounded like thunder, and I felt breathless.

When he measured around, his fingers inevitably brushed against my skin.

It felt like an electric shock, a current surging from my toes to my head.

I awkwardly turned my head away.

Out of the corner of my eye, though, I saw that Dr. Wyatt’s gaze was utterly focused and professional.

Those few minutes felt like centuries.

Finally, Dr. Wyatt spoke. "You can put your clothes back on now."

I fumbled to put my clothes on, but I just couldn’t hook my bra.

Dr. Wyatt, turned to the side, tidying up his instruments. He hesitated, then asked, "Do you need the nurse to help you?"

I quickly shook my head.

"N-no… no, it's fine. You can just help me yourself."

The moment the words left my lips, I saw Dr. Wyatt’s movements freeze. He looked stunned.

I bit my tongue, wishing I could just bang my head against the wall.

What a pathetic mess I was. How could I have blurted out the thought that had just flashed through my mind?

Oh no. A handsome man like Dr. Wyatt, how could he possibly tolerate me saying something like that?

He wouldn’t just kick me out, would he?

I was sweating with anxiety, but my bra hook was stubbornly refusing to cooperate.

A pleasant woody scent suddenly grew stronger.

Dr. Wyatt’s face was right in front of me.

He gently wrapped his arms around me, his hand reaching behind my back, and in one swift motion, he fastened my bra hook.

His warm breath accidentally brushed against my earlobe.

My whole body tingled.

I didn’t dare to move.

Afraid the man in front of me would hear my heart pounding like thunder.

Dr. Wyatt’s expression remained composed. He绅士ly pulled away from me.

"Alright, let’s talk at the desk."

Sitting back down, I was so nervous and embarrassed that I didn't quite catch what Dr. Wyatt was saying.

He good-naturedly repeated, "Your actual cup size is a D. It just appears much larger than other D-cup sizes because your breast shape is conical, unlike round or teardrop shapes."

"I don't think this size should be impacting your daily life. Could you tell me your reason for wanting the surgery?"

My gaze dropped, not daring to look at him.

"Because they’re too prominent. They always attract attention."

Dr. Wyatt smiled.

"You’re so beautiful, why are you afraid of people looking at you?"

I looked up in surprise. "What?"

Dr. Wyatt didn’t seem to be teasing me; his smile was utterly genuine.

He stood up, leaned one hand on the desk, and bent over.

His elegant, slender fingers gently removed my glasses.

His voice was soft, almost caressing: "I think you look even better without your glasses."

The world suddenly turned blurry, and Dr. Wyatt’s handsome features looked like they were covered in a faint mosaic.

I felt like I had seen him somewhere before.

I murmured, "Wyatt?"

He tilted his head.

"Finally remember me?"

His tone was as if… we were old friends reunited.
