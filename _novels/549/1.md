Before I left for my blind date, my mom glared at my oversized, thick hoodie with pure disdain.

"Can’t you ever bother to dress up a little? Do you really think he’ll want you looking like that?"

She forced me into a slightly tighter top, then snatched my glasses off my face.

"What are you doing with those glasses? What if he thinks you’re too bookish, or that you just don't care about your appearance? What if he thinks you’re not *trying* to look good enough for him?"

I habitually hunched my shoulders, mumbling defensively, "I can't see without them."

My mom snorted. "Don't try to fool me. That's a mild prescription; you’re not blind! How could you not see the road?"

"Are you deliberately trying to ruin this date?"

"Let me tell you, this guy has amazing prospects. So many girls would kill to marry him. Don't be so ungrateful."

I wanted to say I also had astigmatism and things looked blurry, but I just shut up.

My mom’s decisions were set in stone. She only believed what she thought was right.

My vision was blurry as I left the house, and because I couldn't make out the numbers, I missed a bus.

By the time I reached the downtown coffee shop, I was 10 minutes late for our appointment.

I scurried into the coffee shop, squinting to find a man in a white shirt.

By the window, a man in a white shirt looked up at me.

It must be him, right?

I hurried over, my face full of apologies.

"I’m so sorry, I’m a little late."

The man seemed to freeze for a moment.

"You are…?"

"I'm Chloe."

"Chloe?"

A smile appeared on his face, his voice sounding a little strange.

"I’m… Wyatt."

His voice was deep and pleasant.

Though his features were a bit blurry to me, I could tell he was good-looking.

Tall and broad-shouldered.

Fair-skinned with thick hair.

He also had a pleasant woody cologne scent.

I awkwardly lowered my gaze.

My mom was right. Such a handsome blind date wouldn't possibly be interested in just an average girl like me.

Sure enough, a few minutes after I sat down, Wyatt took a call.

"Excuse me, I have something to take care of. Can you wait for me here? I'll be right back."

With that, he swiftly strode out of the coffee shop with his long legs.

I let out a bitter laugh.

His excuse was so lame.

He probably just set an alarm to escape, right?

And he didn't even ask for my contact info. Clearly, he wasn't interested.

But I hadn't really expected anything to come of it anyway.

I knew I wasn't good enough for him.

My phone rang. It was my mom.

As soon as I picked up, I was hit with a torrent of scolding.

"Chloe, where did you go? The young man has been waiting for you for 20 minutes!"

I quickly explained.

"We just met. He wasn't interested and he already left."

My mom’s voice grew even shriller.

"What nonsense are you talking about? He just told me he's still waiting for you and hasn't seen a single sign of you!"

My heart dropped.

There were two coffee shops side by side here. In my haste, and with my blurry vision, I must have walked into the wrong one.

So the guy I just met wasn’t my blind date?
