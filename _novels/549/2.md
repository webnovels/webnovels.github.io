After hanging up, I rushed to the coffee shop next door.

There, I met my real blind date.

He wore glasses, had a round face, and was a bit balding. He didn’t really look like a "young man."

I was so late, he was clearly annoyed.

"We in the government sector are very strict about punctuality."

I quickly apologized. "I’m so sorry."

"It's fine, I'll forgive you this time. I’m quite the gentleman, you know."

I didn’t know what to say.

This blind date was arranged by my mom.

She said she was afraid I’d say the wrong thing and offend the guy.

So she added him on SnapChat herself, chatted for a few days, and once she felt he was suitable, she pushed me out to meet him.

My date pulled out his phone.

"Let’s swap SnapChat info. Your mom told me all about you. I gotta say, I’m pretty happy with your appearance."

He then flashed a sleazy grin, teasing,

"Your chest is huge, like a dairy cow’s. Our kids will never go hungry for milk!"

As he spoke, he gestured with his hand, drawing a half-circle in the air.

My face flushed crimson. "Are you out of your mind?!"

Then I stormed out.

Back home, I was met with my mom’s explosive fury.

"Chloe, he said he was interested in you, and you just turned around and ran off! Are you trying to kill me?!"

"You’re a woman over 25, almost 30! Do you even want to get married?!"

I mustered my courage to retort, "That guy’s a creep! Who says someone’s chest is huge like a dairy cow's the first time they meet them?!"

I thought she’d understand.

When I first started developing, she’d always told me that having a big chest was shameful for a girl and I should hide it.

She’d warned me to stay away from boys who stared at my chest.

So I’d gotten used to hunching my shoulders, wearing loose clothes, and trying to conceal my prominent chest.

But my mom just scoffed.

"He was just making a joke, and you’re overreacting! No wonder you don't have any friends!"

"Besides, a woman’s chest is for her husband and children! If you didn’t have that 'asset,' why would a decent guy from a stable government job even look at you?!"

I was so angry I didn't want to talk to her, so I just went back to my room.

My mom kept yelling outside the door.

"Chloe, your mom’s never wrong. Only your mom truly cares about you in this world!"

"Women are only young for a few years! Stop being so picky! You’re no supermodel, and this guy is more than good enough for you…"

Annoyed, I put on my headphones and started scrolling on my phone.

I knew my mom loved me.

But when it came to my relationships, she became completely unreasonable and spoke without thinking.

She’d try to verbally force me to find a man and get married quickly.

She’d strictly guard me in school, not even letting me talk to boys.

But just a couple of years after graduation, she was demanding I go on blind dates and have children. Any old loser was a "good man" in her eyes.

While I definitely wasn’t a supermodel, didn't I deserve to marry a *normal* guy?

I sighed.

I accidentally clicked on an ad.

Starlight Aesthetics Clinic.

I was about to close it when four words caught my eye.

[Breast Reduction Surgery…]

I looked down at the two troublesome mounds on my chest.

Memories flashed through my mind: classmates’ teasing in school, the blind date’s vulgar comments, and my own figure looking like a barrel in a sweatshirt…

I was just an average girl, but these burdens always drew unwanted attention.

It made me feel awkward and self-conscious, so much so that I rarely walked with my head held high.

I hesitated for a moment, then dialed the consultation number.
