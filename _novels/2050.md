During a zombie clearing mission, I got infected protecting my team.
My girlfriend, Chloe, who was also our captain, used "fairness" as an excuse to give the only antidote to a team member who'd snuck out and gotten infected.
Her eyes red, she promised me: "Alex, trust me. I'll find an antidote for you within the three-day incubation period."
I gritted my teeth against the searing pain burning inside me and nodded.
The next day, she actually did bring back an antidote.
But just a second before the serum could be injected into my veins, Brandon, a team member who'd never even left the camp, suddenly frowned.
"Chloe, my head hurts so bad... I'm so scared I might be infected."
Under everyone's watchful eyes, Chloe didn't hesitate. 
She handed that antidote to Brandon.
"Brandon is a team member. If something happens to him, it means I'm an incompetent captain."
"Alex, you're the deputy captain, and my boyfriend. For the sake of fairness, I have to give the medicine to Brandon."
I saw the flicker of triumph in Brandon's eyes and Chloe's unyielding expression. 
I almost laughed–a bitter, furious laugh.
For fairness?
Fine. She'll soon realize she's nothing without me.
