When I was young, I lost a leg saving Jasper.
Later, because of that leg, I was bullied and lost my hearing.
Jasper rushed back from thousands of miles away and promised with tears in his eyes to take care of me for life.
But ten years later, the first words I heard after regaining my hearing were from Jasper's friend asking him.
"Hey, between Nora and Celeste, who do you prefer?"
Jasper laughed softly, "Of course, it's Celeste. Nora's missing a leg, such a downer."
He seemed to forget that Celeste was the one who caused my hearing loss.
