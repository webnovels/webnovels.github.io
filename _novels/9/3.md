On the second day of my marriage, Olivia slapped Charles in front of his mother.
But that wasn't the real drama.
The real drama came when the doctor revealed that Olivia had a congenital heart condition.
"I won't allow this! Divorce her immediately!" Mrs. Scott erupted, furious. She had never liked Olivia, and the revelation of her illness only made things worse.
"You knew, didn't you?" she accused Charles, jabbing a finger at him. "She has heart disease, and you helped her hide it from me! The Scott family can't have a daughter-in-law who's sick! She can't even have children!"
Charles lowered his head, trying to explain. "Medical technology is advanced these days. Her condition won't stop her from having kids—we've already consulted doctors…"
"It's already done. She's my wife and will remain the second Mrs. Scott."
Slap!
Mrs. Scott struck Charles across the face with enough force to leave a red mark on his other cheek.
Despite her rage and physical outbursts, Charles stood firm. He refused to divorce Olivia.
I leaned against the doorway, watching the dramatic scene unfold like a soap opera.
When I left the living room, I ran into Olivia, who was leaning against the wall for support.
Her eyes were red as she gazed toward the living room, her expression one of bittersweet gratitude.
"Even though you tricked him into this marriage, his heart still belongs to me," she said, turning to face me. Her pale face was full of defiance. "He's willing to fight his mother for me. That just proves how deep his love is. You'll never come between us."
I chuckled softly, brushing past her.
"I'm not here to break you two up. I'm here to join the family."
Her lips trembled as I walked away, but then she raised her voice, sharp with anger.
"I'm his true wife! Even if they call it a two-wife arrangement, you're nothing but a glorified mistress!"
When I didn't respond, she grew even more hysterical.
"You think you're so clever, don't you? You're just shameless! Whatever you can give him, I can give him too!"
That night, she dragged Charles into her bedroom, presumably to prove her point.
The Scott estate was huge. I lived on the third floor, while she stayed on the second.
When I went downstairs for water in the middle of the night, I could hear the sounds coming from her room.
The next day, Olivia came to the third floor, her face glowing with satisfaction.
She tugged at her collar, "accidentally" revealing the marks on her neck.
"You're jealous, aren't you?" she said with a smirk. "I have his love, and I can satisfy him in ways you never will."
I frowned, glancing at the marks. "You have a heart condition. You really shouldn't overexert yourself. Especially not around your neck—there are arteries there."
Her smile faltered for a moment before she sneered. "You're just bitter. Don't think you've won just because his mother likes you. I'll never let him go!"
She stormed off, but as I turned around, I saw Mrs. Scott standing in the hallway.
She patted my shoulder with a smile.
"Don't worry. Charles is your husband too. Love will come in time—just be patient."
I blushed and nodded shyly.
"With the business deal already in motion, don't let me down," she added with a meaningful look.
I nodded again, obediently.
Once she was out of sight, my smile vanished.
I would make sure Charles came to me.
But not because I wanted his love.
I just wanted to get pregnant as soon as possible.
