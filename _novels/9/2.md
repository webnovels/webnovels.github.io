"You're right—I'll never compare to Olivia," I said calmly.
"But tonight, you will do what's necessary, or how else will you explain yourself to Mrs. Scott tomorrow?"
I issued my threat without an ounce of shame.
Charles Scott's face went dark, his eyes filled with fury.
Having lost his father and brother, Mrs. Scott was his only family left—and his greatest weakness. Her demands couldn't be ignored, and her approval was something he couldn't afford to lose.
Seeing the storm brewing in his expression, I softened my tone and took a step back.
"I swear, I'll never do anything to hurt Olivia," I said gently, walking closer to him.
"Mrs. Scott wants you to have two wives, and if you have to marry someone else, isn't it better that it's me? At least I won't try to take your love away from her. I just want a child, nothing more."
I smiled, my voice sweet, as though we were having a casual chat.
"All I want is to have a baby, live comfortably, and leave you two to your happily-ever-after. It's a win-win for everyone."
Charles froze, clearly trying to figure out whether I was being honest.
I met his gaze without flinching because I wasn't lying. I had no intention of fighting Olivia for his love—or for anything at all.
"I heard you come from a wealthy family," Charles said suspiciously. "Not as rich as the Scotts, of course, but it's not like you're starving. What did my mom promise your family? Must've been a pretty sweet business deal."
I sighed inwardly and nodded. "Yes, she's helping my family out. But I also married you of my own free will."
I tilted my head, smiling playfully. "Why don't you just pretend I'm madly in love with you and couldn't live without you?"
Before he could respond, I grabbed him by the arm and dragged him into the bathroom, pulling at his shirt.
"Let's get this over with. The sooner I'm pregnant, the sooner you won't have to deal with me anymore."
Charles stiffened as I stripped off his shirt, his face a mask of disdain. The contempt in his eyes was so thick it practically dripped off him.
"I've never met anyone as shameless as you," he said coldly. "You don't even bother pretending to have dignity."
I gasped dramatically, wrapping my arms around his neck.
What a heartless man—he had zero regard for a woman's feelings.
Hah. Men. They'll look down on you in public but won't hesitate to take what they want in private.
The next morning, I went downstairs, now dressed and composed, and saw Charles sitting in the living room with Mrs. Scott and a pale, tearful Olivia by his side.
Charles was holding Olivia's hand tightly, his voice gentle.
"You should rest more. I know last night was hard on you."
Mrs. Scott, obliviously cheerful, grabbed my hand and gave me a satisfied smile.
"Even though you're not officially married to Charles, you're still my daughter-in-law. Now hurry up and give the Scott family some grandkids!"
Her words were pointed, and Olivia's face turned even paler.
When her gaze fell on the marks on my neck, she froze, her body trembling. Tears spilled down her cheeks.
"Charles Scott, looks like you had a great time last night!"
Slap!
Her voice shook as she slapped Charles hard across the face.
Before anyone could react, she clutched her chest and suddenly collapsed.
