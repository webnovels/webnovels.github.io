The billionaire heir announced he would marry two women—essentially uniting two families under one roof.
The news rocked high society like an earthquake.
The wealthy Scott family had two sons, but tragedy struck when the eldest and their father both died in a plane crash.
Mrs. Scott, devastated and desperate, demanded her younger son, Charles Scott, take two wives to preserve the family legacy. Only one wife could legally register the marriage, however, and Charles already had a woman he loved deeply.
No one wanted their daughter to be the one without official status.
Except me.
I happily moved into the lavish mansion without hesitation.
"I might have married you, but my heart belongs to Olivia," Charles said coldly.
I nodded seriously, lying unsaddened on the mansion's eight-hundred-metre king-size bed.
After all, I wasn't here to break them apart—I was here to join the family.
"Girls these days will do anything for money."
"No kidding. They say he's marrying two wives, but only one gets the legal title. The other one? Just some shameless mistress without a name."
"Crazy, right? And to think she's from a wealthy family herself—how embarrassing."
I sat on the edge of the bed, listening to the maids gossip outside.
It was almost midnight when Charles stumbled drunkenly into the room.
He sat at the edge of the bed, staring at me with a deep hatred in his eyes.
"I might've married you, but you know perfectly well that my heart belongs to Olivia. You'll never compare to her."
"We might've had a wedding, but I'm not getting a marriage certificate with you. Legally, Olivia will be my wife—no one else."
His words were blunt, and his glare was sharp, as if he was waiting for me to crack.
I nodded with a calm smile, unfazed.
The Scott family, one of the richest in the fictional country of Westmont, had two sons.
The eldest, Michael, was the perfect heir—gracious, intelligent, and well-loved. He was groomed to take over the family empire, but a tragic accident during a business trip with Mr. Scott shattered those plans.
Charles, the younger son, was left to inherit the family fortune. But Charles was different—he had a fiery romance with Olivia, a woman from a modest background. Their love story was no secret in the elite circles.
The couple faced criticism for their relationship but vowed to defy societal expectations and stay together—a testament to their "pure and undying love."
But this love was precisely what Mrs. Scott opposed.
When she decided Charles should marry two women to continue the Scott legacy, she made it clear she didn't approve of Olivia.
Still, Charles and Olivia's passionate love story continued to make waves.
In elite families, it wasn't uncommon for men to have affairs, but they were expected to keep their wives happy and maintain appearances.
Charles, however, was different. His "second wife" would receive neither love nor respect—an unenviable position.
No respectable family would willingly send their daughter into such a situation.
Except me.
"If I don't agree to the two-wife arrangement and marry you, my mother won't let me register my marriage with Olivia. She's the reason you're here, so don't provoke her. Stay out of her way," Charles said coldly, his eyes filled with disdain.
I scratched my cheek and smiled.
"Relax. I'm not here to ruin your relationship—I'm here to join the family."
As I unzipped the back of my wedding dress, his expression darkened.
"Are you seriously suggesting…?" he asked in disbelief.
I chuckled, calmly slipping off the dress.
"You're marrying two women to carry on the family name, right? You have your job, and I have mine. Let's get this over with—it's better for everyone."
He frowned, his eyes filled with contempt and disgust.
"Fiona Monroe, you'll do anything for money, won't you?"
"You're nothing but a gold digger. How could someone like you ever compare to Olivia?"
