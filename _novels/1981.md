At our holiday family gathering on New Year's Eve, my mom suddenly blurted out, loud enough for everyone to hear:
"Which man gave you the flu?"
I stared at her, completely confused. "What are you talking about?"
My mom smirked, looking smug. "I knew you couldn't stay out of trouble."
Then, she looked pointedly at my husband, Ryan, and added, her voice dripping with implication:
"You probably don't know this, but before Emma married you, she was wild. Her dad and I couldn't rein her in at all."
My eyes widened. "What are you saying?"
Seeing my anger, my mom seemed to get even happier. "What's wrong? Did you do it but can't own up to it now?"
Facing my mother's slander, I clenched my fists under the table.
Since you love spreading malicious rumors about me so much, I guess I don't need to keep your secrets anymore.

At the dinner table, in front of everyone, my mom continued her endless stream of nonsense:
"Emma, you're incredibly lucky to have found a husband like Ryan. Yet, you're still not satisfied, going out and messing around behind his back. Do you think you're some kind of irresistible charmer?"
I was so furious my head was spinning.
"What right do you have to say I'm cheating? Do you have any proof?"
My mom rolled her eyes, airily dismissing me.
"Ryan doesn't have the flu, but you do. And you had hives recently too. If you weren't messing around, where did these illnesses come from?"
It was true, I'd been sick a few times lately.
Year-end financial closings were brutal, with tons of projects and constant overtime, leading to irregular meals and a weakened immune system.
But I thought it was all worth it, because I'd achieved my goals, delivering accurate data by year-end. My colleagues even said I was the most promising candidate for promotion next year.
I never imagined all that hard work would become my mother's excuse to badmouth me.
Facing the questioning gazes of my in-laws and Ryan, my dad chuckled and said to me:
"Alright, your mom is just joking, don't take it seriously."
My dad always felt Mom had sacrificed a lot when they were building their business, so no matter how wild she got, he chose to forgive her unconditionally.
And because of that endless indulgence, my mom only became more outrageous.
Watching everyone's faces return to normal, she turned back to Ryan and continued:
"Starting tomorrow, I'll move into your house to keep an eye on Emma, so she doesn't mess around again."
Ryan awkwardly waved his hand. "No, Mom, it's fine. Emma is perfectly good, she won't cause any trouble."
My mom grabbed Ryan's hand, glaring.
"A man shouldn't be such a doormat! If she does something to hurt you, I absolutely must discipline her."
"If you can't bring yourself to scold or punish her, I will. I promise I'll whip her into shape."
Watching my mom's earnest declaration, I suddenly felt a twisted urge to laugh.
Were these words really coming from my own mother?
Other mothers wish their daughters well; even if there's conflict between a young couple, they'd side with their daughter.
But my mom? She just dragged my name through the mud and then offered to discipline me on behalf of my husband.
After the holiday dinner ended, my mom continued to monopolize Ryan and my in-laws, talking endlessly.
Seeing my in-laws' grim faces and Ryan's evasive eyes, I suddenly realized I was truly fed up with my mom.
