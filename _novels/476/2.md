The calculation in Penny's eyes was about to spill over.

She just wanted to ruin me to get the early admission spot to the top university.

I didn't say anything more and followed her downstairs.

On the way, I secretly sent pre-written SOS messages to the principal and other school leaders, as well as contacting some influencers who were livestreaming nearby.

Lily was the principal's daughter, after all.

In my past life, when persuading me to drop out, the principal had utterly humiliated me, saying I was damaged goods that had been ridden by thousands.

This time, I wanted the principal to get a good look at the show her daughter was putting on.

As we approached the bathroom, we could hear ambiguous sounds coming from inside.

"Zack, baby, more, I want more."

"Zack, you're so good."

The woman's moans and the man's grunts were nonstop.

Penny's eyes darted around:

"Natalie, you go in first to stop them. I'll go find someone to help."

"No, I can't go in. Let's just wait here for the teachers," I said, shrinking my neck and pretending to be scared.

Penny glared at me in annoyance. She forced down her temper and lowered her voice:

"If you don't go in now, they'll go all the way. Do you really want to let Zack go to Lily?"

The bathroom's outer door wasn't fully closed.

Through the crack, I could see Zack pressing Lily against the wall.

Lily was half-undressed, exposing herself.

Zack was frantically tearing at Lily's uniform, biting all over her body.

Lily pretended to struggle, but wasn't actually using any strength.

Her coy resistance only made Zack more uncontrollable.

I pressed my lips together tightly, pretending to be conflicted:

"Okay, you're right. I'll go in now."

Just as I was about to push the door open, I turned back to Penny and said, "Hurry and find a teacher. I can't hold out for long."

Penny nodded eagerly.

She turned and ran. But after rounding a corner, she came back.

She gleefully took out her phone, started recording, and wedged it into the door crack.

Inside was chaotic, with lewd sounds coming out unabashedly.

After doing this, Penny finally went to find teachers and security guards, feeling very pleased with herself.

When a group of people rushed to the teaching building, the couple inside were still going at it vigorously.

Penny covered her face and cried, blocking the principal.

"Teacher, I... I don't know why they're doing this!"

The principal's face was dark with anger. She didn't know her daughter Lily was inside.

Penny hadn't clarified who exactly was in there.

Penny wanted to ruin not just me, but Lily as well. After all, in her eyes, we were both her competitors.

Today, education bureau officials happened to be visiting for an inspection.

Now, a group of education officials were following the principal to "catch people in the act". The scene couldn't be more dramatic.

The principal was shaking with rage.

With education officials watching, it seemed her chances for promotion were likely ruined.

I guessed the principal probably wanted to kill the adulterous couple inside right now.

The principal tried to move forward.

Penny blocked the principal again, crying and wailing,

"Principal, inside is... is is..."

She pretended to be reluctant.

The principal grabbed her shoulders, "Who is it?"

Penny acted like she had been frightened to tears, and said between sobs,

"It's Natalie."

The principal naturally knew who I was. My grades were always top of the year, and I was the most promising candidate for early admission to the top university.

The principal's eyes bulged with rage.

"That sl—"

She abruptly cut off the insult she was about to hurl.

The education officials were still watching, so the principal couldn't speak too harshly at this moment.

The people inside were still lost in their passion, completely unaware of the commotion outside.

The lewd sounds coming from inside grew even more unbridled.

Penny covered her chest and cried:

"Natalie, how could you be so foolish! Why can't you control yourself? Are you really that desperate for men?"

With those words, the education officials' expressions turned extremely unpleasant.

They considered themselves respectable people and didn't want to barge in at a moment like this.

A group of people with varying expressions waited downstairs, looking at each other awkwardly.

"Me? What about me?" I finally emerged from my hiding place in the shadows.
