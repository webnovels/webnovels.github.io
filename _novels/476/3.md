"Why are you here?" Penny cried out in shock.

The principal eyed me suspiciously, "It's not you? Then who's inside?"

I shrugged, "I don't know. I didn't see clearly who it was."

Since Penny deliberately concealed it, I naturally had no reason to expose it.

At this moment, several influencers who had received my message barged in, ignoring the school security guards trying to stop them.

"Wow, the students at your school are so open, having sex in broad daylight."

"Yeah, Principal, aren't you going to take us for a look?"

"Principal, what are your thoughts on this? Chat with the viewers in our livestream."

The principal's face turned ashen. She clenched her jaw and said nothing.

Penny stared at me intently, finally losing it.

She grabbed my hand:

"Didn't you go in? Then who went in just now?"

"I was scared and didn't dare go in," I said, trying hard to squeeze out tears and acting like a coward.

Penny was so angry she raised her hand to slap me.

Just as her palm was about to hit my face, she stopped herself abruptly, glaring at me fiercely.

The influencers' cameras zoomed in.

Comments in the livestream were scrolling rapidly.

[666, this is so exciting.]

[You can tell how intense it is just from the sounds.]

[Streamer, hurry up and go in to record. Let us bros feast our eyes.]

The influencer chuckled, "I wouldn't dare. If I went in, my stream would get banned immediately."

I turned away from the camera and flashed a smile at Penny.

She stared at me in shock, her eyes wide.

"You..."

"What's wrong, class monitor?" I asked innocently.

An education bureau official's face had turned red. He pointed at the bathroom:

"Old Lin, go talk some sense into your students!"

This incident could no longer be covered up.

The principal was so angry her face was twitching. "Good, good, good. These students are really something."

As the principal charged towards the bathroom, I ran over crying and grabbed her.

"Teacher, you'd better not go in."

The principal shoved me away forcefully.

"Get lost! Why are you all trying to stop me? What are you up to?"

Everyone frowned as they looked at me.

Penny had finally reacted by now.

She hid in the crowd, staring at me unblinkingly.

She must have thought of something, because she suddenly ran over.

"Natalie, stop interfering with them. I know you like Zack, but he deserves this," she said.

She acted like she was looking out for me as she pulled me away, her voice full of pain:

"We're just students. We shouldn't get involved in the teachers' business."

Seeing that I still wanted to block the way, the principal pushed me aside forcefully.

I cried my heart out, wailing to the livestream cameras:

"But there are so many people here. If this gets out, what will happen to the people inside?"

I pretended to be very concerned about the people inside.

On camera, of course I had to act like I cared about my classmates.

This time, I was the only one occupying the moral high ground.

Hearing this, the principal paused.

The education officials also looked troubled.

On camera, they couldn't just barge in to "catch people in the act" like this.

If it caused the students involved to do something drastic, they couldn't bear that responsibility.

So the group of people hesitated about 30 meters away from the bathroom in the teaching building.

We weren't very close, but we could still clearly hear the sounds from inside.

The influencers tried to get closer to film, but were blocked by the security guards.

And so, the group waited outside like cats on hot bricks.

It took a full two hours before the noises inside finally died down.

The bathroom door opened.

But to everyone's surprise, the satiated-looking man who walked out wasn't a student from our school.

The man was burly and strong, with a scar on his face.

Seeing so many eyes staring at him, he spat in disgust.

"What are you looking at? Keep staring and I'll gouge your eyeballs out."

Seeing it was some thug, the principal visibly relaxed.

As long as it wasn't students involved, it would be easier to handle.

But then someone cried out in shock,

"Holy sh*t, inside..."
