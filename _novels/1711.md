The day Marcus Cole realized I hadn't filed an expense report with the family office for a whole week, he assumed I’d finally grown out of my ‘small-minded’ habits. With a dismissive, almost charitable air, he tossed an American Express Centurion Card onto the mahogany dining table.
“I’ve covered your father’s final dialysis bill,” he said, his voice flat. “Just try not to bore me with these pathetic peasant dramas anymore.”
He paused, sipping his twenty-year-old single malt. “I know that bottomless pit of yours is hard to fill, but as a Cole, you need to learn to manage your appetite. Your manners are hideous.”
What he didn’t know was that the moment I reached for the black card, I had already signed the divorce papers and my full-body organ donation consent form.
The clothes on my back were the same pilling, five-year-old college hoodie he’d once mocked me for wearing. No one would believe that the wife of Marcus Cole, the man who controlled half the resources in the entertainment industry, had to snap a photo of a receipt for a five-dollar box of tampons and upload it to his assistant’s phone for approval.
It was his ‘rule.’ He believed that a gold-digger like me would instantly go feral and start spending wildly the second I held real money.
A week ago, my father needed an emergency procedure after a massive stroke. I knelt and begged Marcus for twenty thousand dollars. His executive muse, Cassidy Shaw—the woman he’d almost married in college—had deliberately pulled my transfer application from the queue. She’d even smiled as she did it, claiming she was helping me break my habit of "insatiable greed."
Marcus had no idea I endured this humiliation only because my father was dependent on the state-of-the-art life support in his private hospital wing.
Now, they’d pulled the plug after a missed payment. My father was ashes in a box. I had no reason to keep playing his obedient, caged pet.

1.
My phone vibrated on the reclaimed wood of the kitchen island.
Marcus’s message popped up, dripping with that usual air of lofty condescension.
“Your father’s treatment is reinstated. Now be a good girl and stop inventing emergencies to demand extra funds. I know where you come from, but my money isn’t that easy to fool.”
I stared at the two lines, feeling a startling, almost transcendent calm.
I typed a single word: “Understood.”
I set the phone down and slid the signed divorce agreement across the counter.
Marcus probably thought my three days of silence and lack of expense reports meant I was attempting a ‘cold war.’ It was his favorite word for any attempt I made at asserting myself. For three years, I had lived like a dog on a leash for the sake of my father’s medical bills.
I had no independent income. Marcus had forbidden me from working, claiming the Cole name was too prestigious for a wife who ‘paraded herself in the marketplace.’ Yet, he gave me no allowance. Every single cent I spent had to go through his corporate Expense Reporting System.
Groceries required approval.
Toiletries required approval.
Even the three dollars for a subway ride necessitated a photo of the receipt.
The Approver? His personal, long-time Executive Assistant: Cassidy Shaw. The woman who had been his "Red-Headed Confidante" since college, the one everyone knew was the Perfect Standard I could never meet.
Three days ago.
The hospital delivered a Code Blue. My father’s stroke had worsened, requiring immediate, emergency brain surgery.
Two hundred thousand dollars. To Marcus, it was the cost of a single bottle of wine for one of his parties.
I called him, frantic.
Ten, twelve, fourteen calls.
When it finally connected, it was Cassidy’s voice.
“Ellie, honey, Marcus is in a high-level strategy meeting. Is everything okay?” Her voice was smooth, like warm honey poured over ice.
I didn't care about propriety. I sobbed into the phone. “Cassidy, please, let me talk to him! My father is dying. I need two hundred thousand dollars for the surgery now!”
I heard a soft, pitying laugh on the other end.
“Ellie, you know the Cole Corp protocol.”
“Two hundred thousand is a major withdrawal. You have to run it through the ERP system, darling. Marcus hates rule-breakers, especially when money is involved. You’ll just upset him if you try to bypass me.”
“Hurry up and submit the request. I’ll look at it as soon as I can.”
The line went dead.
My hand was shaking so badly I could barely hold the phone. I logged into the damned ERP system.
Reason: Emergency Brain Surgery.
Amount: $200,000.00.
Attachment: Critical Condition Notice.
Submit.
I stared at the screen. One second. Two seconds.
Ten minutes later.
The phone dinged. Not a bank alert, but a system notification.
REJECTED.
Rejected by: Cassidy Shaw.
Reason for Rejection: Attachment format unclear. Please re-scan and upload.
All the blood in my body turned to ice.
2.
I re-photographed the notice. My hands were trembling, the image slightly blurred. I took another one. Every second was a hammer blow against my father’s life.
I submitted the request again.
Five minutes later.
REJECTED.
Reason for Rejection: Requested amount is excessive. Must supplement with detailed itemized breakdown of costs, accurate to the exact price of each medication.
I felt a surge of hysterical madness. The surgery hadn't even started; the doctors were fighting to stabilize him. How was I supposed to get an itemized breakdown accurate to the milligram?
I messaged Cassidy on her private line.
“Please, I beg you. Approve it first. It’s life-or-death money!”
“I’ll send the breakdown later. Cassidy, this is a human life!”
She sent back a cute, animated bunny emoji.
“Sister, I want to help, but I can’t. Financial policy is financial policy. You used to be so lax with money. Marcus is trying to help you, you know. He said we have to teach you some discipline.”
I sank to my knees outside the operating room doors, the phone still clutched in my hand. I felt like a stray mutt whose spine had been pulled out.
I texted Marcus. I sent him voice notes.
“Marcus, I’m begging you.”
“Just approve the money, and I’ll do anything you say. I’ll never fight with you again. I won't be jealous of Cassidy. Please, save my father.”
Half an hour later.
Marcus finally sent a short voice note. The background was loud and boisterous—music, laughter. His voice was slurred with an impatient annoyance.
“Do what Cassidy says. Don’t bother me.”
At that exact moment.
The light above the O.R. door went out.
The surgeon walked out, pulled down his mask, and shook his head with profound regret.
“I’m sorry. If the payment had gone through even ten minutes earlier, we could have administered the clotting agent…”
I didn't hear the rest. The world went eerily quiet.
The man who had raised me, the man who had worked two jobs and sifted through trash to pay for my physics tuition, the only family I had left—he was dead.
Killed by a piece of paper that wasn’t in the “correct format.”
The body grew cold.
My love for Marcus Cole chilled along with it.
For the last three days.
I handled the funeral. Cremation. The scattering of ashes in his favorite park.
I didn’t tell Marcus. There was no need.
He was so afraid I would cheat him out of money. Now, I would never ask him for a single cent again.
I looked at the 'charitable' text message he'd sent moments ago. A tiny, cold smile touched my lips.
He thought I was angling for attention again. He had no idea this was the final courtesy I was offering him.
A red notification popped up from social media. It was Cassidy. The photo was a shot of an exclusive sushi bar, and a man’s hand wearing the limited-edition Patek Philippe watch I had once planned to save up and buy Marcus for his birthday.
The caption: “Thanks to the Boss for improving my dining experience. Some people just keep reaching for handouts, so distracting.”
I tapped the ‘like’ button.
It was the first and last time I would ever endorse Cassidy Shaw.
The phone rang immediately. Marcus. He must have seen the ‘like’ and thought I was being passive-aggressive.
I didn’t answer.
He texted.
“Ellie, who are you being sarcastic to? Don’t let people misunderstand Cassidy. She was only doing her job.”
“Un-like that post immediately, or I’ll shut down your primary credit line.”
Doing her job?
Doing her job murdering my father?
I laughed, a dry, rasping sound.
I clicked back to the post, and under Cassidy’s arrogant caption, I typed a comment:
“Cassidy, the secretary who got ahead by holding up the Boss’s wife’s emergency medical payment until her father died. That’s some smart career climbing. Enjoy your blood-money apartment. You and the Boss are a match made in hell. Lock it up, you two deserve each other.”
Post.
Block.
Power off.
The world was finally, blessedly quiet.
3.
I started packing.
There wasn't much to gather. I had lived in this so-called home for three years. The things that were truly mine were laughably few.
The dressing room was immense. The left wall was a monument to Marcus’s bespoke suits. The right side held several locked glass cabinets. They housed the jewels, the designer bags, the limited-edition shoes.
The keys and biometric access were controlled by Cassidy Shaw.
Every time I had to attend a high-profile gala, I had to request the items from Cassidy, like borrowing a costume from a prop house. When I was done, I had to return them. Once, I accidentally snagged the hem of a gown. Cassidy, in front of the housekeeper, made me write a three-thousand-word letter of apology and docked my allowance for the following month.
Marcus had watched, unmoved. He’d just said, “Cassidy is teaching you a lesson, Ellie. These things are expensive. You can’t afford to replace them.”
He was right. I couldn’t afford it. I was the orphan, the working-class girl in their eyes.
I pulled open the door to my own small corner of the closet. Inside hung a few pilling sweaters and a couple of faded pairs of jeans. The only piece of clothing that felt significant was the plain, off-white cotton T-shirt I had worn three years ago on the day I married him.
Back then, I wasn't just Marcus’s wife. I was State University’s youngest Physics Ph.D. candidate, a genius prodigy with an open-ended career in academia.
Marcus had said he loved that cool, clear fire in my eyes.
“Ellie,” he’d promised, “marry me. I’ll give you a real home.”
I had believed him. I gave up my chance for an international research fellowship. I ignored my professor’s pleas. I traded my lab coat for an apron, and in this golden cage, I had made myself a walking joke.
I peeled off the cheap, pilling hoodie Marcus hated. I pulled on the faded white T-shirt. My jeans felt a little loose. I had lost twenty pounds over the last three years.
I hauled out a battered old suitcase.
Inside, I carefully placed a few heavy textbooks, a handful of family photos, and my father’s small, black wooden urn.
Everything else in the mansion—the art, the crystal, the silk—was irrelevant to me.
I walked down the grand staircase. Mrs. Gable, the housekeeper, was polishing an antique vase. She spotted me dragging the suitcase and rolled her eyes.
“Leaving us again, Mrs. Cole?”
“Mr. Cole said if you walk out this time, don’t bother coming back.” She straightened up, dusting her hands. “Oh, and the Boss wants his miso soup for dinner. Don’t forget to make it.”
Even the help looked down on me. They knew their monthly salary was higher than my personal spending allowance.
I stopped and looked at Mrs. Gable.
“Make your own soup, Mrs. Gable.”
“Or better yet, ask Cassidy to make it.”
She froze, stunned by the coldness in my voice. “What kind of attitude is that? Do you want me to report you to the Boss—”
“Be my guest.”
I pulled the suitcase to the massive, wrought-iron front door and walked out.
The afternoon sun was blinding. I raised a hand to shield my eyes.
Three years.
I had finally walked out of that mausoleum.
4.
Marcus returned faster than I anticipated. He must have seen my comment and the steam had burst out of his ears.
He wasn’t here to reconcile. He was here to defend his precious Cassidy.
I couldn’t hail a taxi at the gates of the exclusive Cole Estate. A black Maybach screeched to a halt in front of me.
The door flew open. Marcus stepped out, his face a mask of furious frost. Cassidy scurried out behind him, her eyes red, playing the part of the deeply wronged victim.
“Ellie, what the hell is wrong with you?”
Marcus grabbed my wrist, his fingers biting into my skin.
“Apologize to Cassidy. Now!”
“What kind of insane lies are you spreading on social media? What good does it do you to ruin her reputation?”
I looked at the face that had once made my heart do acrobatics. Now, I only felt revulsion.
“Am I lying?”
I wrenched my arm free and turned my gaze, cold and steady, on Cassidy.
“Cassidy, you tell him. Am I lying?”
Marcus was momentarily taken aback. He didn't know the exact details—only that I was asking for a huge amount of money and Cassidy had advised against it on principle. He instinctively looked at her.
Cassidy’s body trembled, and tears welled up instantly.
“Marcus… I didn’t mean to…”
“I was only following the company’s strict financial policy, Marcus. And… and Ellie’s tone was so hostile; I didn’t realize it was life-or-death money at the time.”
She sniffled. “Besides, I told the finance team to prepare the funds right away, and I was going to push it through, but Ellie never resubmitted the form!”
What a flawless performance. What a cunning spin on "never resubmitted."
The man was dead. Was I supposed to resubmit the form to the Grim Reaper?
Marcus’s frown deepened. He turned back to me, his eyes full of crushing disappointment.
“Ellie, you have truly let me down.”
“Cassidy was professional. How can you be so vicious? Your father had a chronic condition; how critical could it have been?”
“You’re slandering Cassidy online over this paltry amount of money. Where is your dignity? Your breeding?”
Dignity? I was supposed to have dignity when facing a killer?
I laughed, the sound hollow.
“Marcus, you are hopelessly blind.”
“Since you trust her so implicitly, there is nothing left to discuss.”
“The divorce papers are on your study desk. Sign them.”
I reached for my suitcase.
My attitude enraged him. He snatched the battered case and slammed it onto the asphalt.
The old zipper burst.
My few belongings spilled onto the pavement. A few threadbare sweaters, a stack of books. And one small, black wooden box.
The urn rolled a few times, stopping right at Marcus’s Italian leather loafer.
Marcus froze. He stared at the box, his pupils contracting violently.
“What is this?”
I bent down, carefully retrieved the urn, and brushed the dust from the simple wooden surface.
“It’s my father.”
“Marcus, are you satisfied now?”
