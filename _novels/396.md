Eight years ago, I dropped out of college and worked tirelessly to pay for Valerie’s tuition.
She clung to me, tears streaming, swearing she’d never betray me, not ever.
Years later, she built her own empire, becoming a multi-millionaire CEO.
But the night I was diagnosed with terminal cancer, I saw her, under a streetlamp, kissing someone else.
That same night, she broke up with me. My heart turned to ash. “Valerie, what about our eight years?”
She looked at me, her voice icy. “Eight years? That’s not long at all. Not to me.”
“Your eight years might have been all about me, but my eight years? They were about so much more than just you.”
Yet, when she learned of my death, she completely lost her mind.

“I’m sorry, Mr. Alex. The diagnosis is in. It’s late-stage stomach cancer.”
The doctor handed me the report, his eyes filled with pity.
I felt like I’d been struck by a lightning bolt. It was just a stomach ache, how could it be a terminal illness?
A million questions flooded my mind, but a lump formed in my throat, and I couldn't make a sound.
I opened my mouth, and after a long moment, finally managed to ask, “How much longer… do I have?”
The doctor adjusted his glasses. “Three months, at most.”
I let out a bitter laugh, took the diagnosis, and stood up to leave.
It wasn't until I was outside, sitting in my car, that I covered my eyes and broke down, sobbing.
My cries were muffled, a raw, hoarse sound tearing from deep in my throat.
Only three months left to live. What about Valerie? How would she survive, alone, after I was gone?
The night breeze carried a chilling bite as I stood on the balcony, waiting for Valerie to return.
I’d shredded the diagnosis, tearing it into tiny pieces, then watched them swirl down the drain.
I waited from day until night. In those dozen or so hours, I finally understood. I couldn’t tell Valerie.
Everyone says it’s better to cut ties cleanly, better a quick, sharp pain than a lingering one. But I… I didn’t want her to hurt at all.
A familiar silhouette gradually appeared under the streetlamp. I was just wondering why Valerie hadn’t driven home today when, the next second, I saw her pulled into someone else’s embrace and kissed.
In an instant, the blood in my veins seemed to freeze. The two figures under the streetlamp looked exactly like a pair of lovers.
Valerie didn’t pull away. She let him kiss her on the side of her lips, then watched him leave.
The villa’s front door opened, let in by the housekeeper. I waited on the second floor, my mind a blank slate.
Soon after, she walked into the room and gently hugged me from behind.
“Alex, I’m so tired today.”
My body stiffened. I subtly pulled away from her embrace.
Valerie looked at me, a hint of complaint in her voice. “What’s wrong?”
I reached up and plucked a rose petal from her hair. It was from when she and that other person stood under the roses, kissing.
My fingers trembled slightly. I looked up at her, my voice low as I demanded, “Who was that person?”
Valerie’s face instantly changed. “You saw?”
I waited silently for her explanation, but she just calmly told me, “Alex, there’s nothing between us. You know I only love you.”
“You’re the only one I’m truly sincere about.”
My heart was practically numb with pain. I let out a self-deprecating laugh. “Oh, really? Valerie, then your ‘sincerity’ comes cheap.”
Perhaps stung by my words, Valerie’s expression gradually darkened. “I don’t want to argue with you.”
I repeated her words. “I don’t want to argue either. I want an explanation.”
“Tell me, who was he?”
Valerie’s expression grew impatient. “You can’t stand it, can you?”
She coldly tossed out, “Then let’s break up.”
I barely reacted, just stared at her, stunned. “You… what did you say?”
Valerie’s eyes darted away, but she still told me, word for word, “I said, if you can’t stand it, then let’s break up.”
Suddenly, my nose stung. My voice choked in my throat. “Break up?”
My lips trembled slightly as I asked her, “Valerie, what about our eight years?”
She looked at me, her gaze icy. “Eight years? That’s not long at all. Not to me.”
“Your eight years might have been all about me, but my eight years? They were about so much more than just you.”
A sudden, violent pain erupted in my stomach, spreading to my heart. I could barely stand.
Valerie ran a frustrated hand through her hair. “I’ll meet many more people. Alex, if you don’t trust me, then what’s the point of dragging this on?”
I forced myself to maintain a calm facade, my nails digging into my palms.
A coppery taste filled my mouth. I gritted my teeth and said, “Valerie, say ‘break up’ one more time, and I’ll never appear before you again.”
She opened her mouth, but in the end, she just slammed the door shut. “I’m staying at the apartment tonight.”
It wasn't until her voice completely faded that I collapsed weakly to the ground.
Blood seeped from the corner of my mouth. I covered my mouth with my hand, but the next second, I violently vomited a large mouthful of fresh blood.
