I attended a private auction with my Uncle Jack. Little did I know that the items up for bid were intimate photos of Bella, the girl everyone thought was the real heiress.
Uncle Jack urged me to place a bid. But just then, I received a text message:
"If you dare to bid, I'll reveal your secret."
In that moment of hesitation, a man swooped in and won the bid for Bella's private photos.
I thought Uncle Jack would be angry with me, but to my surprise, he suddenly chartered a yacht, saying he wanted to celebrate my 20th birthday.
He boasted that he'd give me an unforgettable surprise!
But I never imagined that on the yacht, in front of everyone, he would display photos of me from when I was trafficked.
