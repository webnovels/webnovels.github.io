Two months after I broke up with Lena, she walked into the convenience store where I worked and came straight for the condom aisle with her new boyfriend in tow.
She stopped right in front of the display, turning to the guy next to her. Her voice was too loud, too sweet, and clearly meant for my ears.
“There are so many kinds, Gideon,” she purred. “Which one is the most comfortable? You should recommend one.”
Gideon, a preppy-looking guy whose face was a study in faint pink, just stared at the wall of neon-colored boxes and couldn’t come up with anything.
Lena laughed—a light, sharp sound. “My bad, I almost forgot. You never used one with me, so you wouldn’t have the experience, would you?”
I kept my head down, scrubbing a spot on the register counter that wasn't actually dirty. I said nothing.
She chuckled again, that knowing, predatory glint in her eyes as she finally looked my way.
“How about you, Connor?” she challenged. “Any recommendations?”

I stared blankly for a second. The buzzing in my ears was loud, but her words were louder.
I picked up a box of a popular brand. “This one has excellent lubrication. It’s particularly gentle for women, and it’s thin—barely any presence at all. Might be worth a try.”
Lena’s smile tightened, just a fraction. “You sound very well-versed.”
I gave a noncommittal shrug. “It’s fine.”
She held the package between her fingers, her tone pointed. “I guess you use this one a lot with your girlfriend, then?”
Gideon snorted a laugh next to her.
“Look at his uniform, Lena,” he scoffed. “It probably costs less than thirty bucks for his whole outfit.”
“That brand of condoms is the most expensive one we carry. His broke girlfriend and he probably can’t afford them. I bet they’re using some cheap, flimsy trash that breaks easily.”
Lena’s gaze was fixed on my face, clearly hoping to catch a flicker of shame or distress.
I didn't give her the satisfaction. I just maintained a professional, easy smile.
“Ma’am, rest assured, I’ve personally checked the quality of every product in this store,” I said, my voice even. “They are all top-tier. You can purchase with confidence.”
Lena’s hand froze mid-air, and the color drained visibly from her face.
She let out a dismissive scoff. “Fine. We’ll take the one you recommend. If it’s not any good, I’ll be back to find you.”
She bought a single box and walked out, her arm tucked possessively through Gideon’s.
After that day, I guess the brand I’d recommended really was that good.
For a straight week, she brought Gideon to my register every single day to buy the same kind—the ultra-thin Aura brand.
Even Mr. Henderson, the store manager, couldn’t help but make a joke. “I’ve never seen anything like it. A box a day, and those are the five-packs. That customer must have a serious appetite.”
“These rich kids sure know how to have a good time. Stamina of an Olympic athlete.”
“Oh, by the way, did you see the car she drives? A Rolls-Royce Ghost. There are only a few limited-edition models in the country. That thing is easily north of a million dollars.”
“No wonder this area is the infamous Gold Coast of Chicago. So many wealthy people hiding in plain sight.”
“Her boyfriend is a lucky guy. Head-to-toe designer clothes. A single accessory on him is probably worth a year of a regular person’s salary. He’s nowhere near as good-looking as you, Connor, but he’s got the golden ticket.”
“But you know, that boyfriend of hers looks familiar.”
“I think I saw him in your college graduation photo…”
I paused, staying silent.
Mr. Henderson nudged my arm curiously.
“Connor Reid, is he really your college roommate?”
“How did they end up together? Come on, tell me the gossip. You’re practically family here.”
I didn't take the bait.
I just lowered my head and murmured:
“There’s no gossip, Mr. Henderson.”
“Can I request a couple of days off for a medical check-up? My stomach has been acting up lately.”
Mr. Henderson looked concerned. “Of course, go ahead. Is your girlfriend going with you this time?”
I shook my head. “No, I’m going alone.”
He sighed. “It’s always just you, isn’t it? Your girlfriend doesn't seem to care much about your health.”
I pursed my lips and remained silent.

The whole situation was, to use a cliché, absolutely ridiculous.
The boyfriend on Lena’s arm was indeed my college roommate, Calvin Pierce.
Back in college, Calvin used my photos to catfish Lena online without my knowledge.
Everyone in the dorm knew he was dating a wealthy woman.
He never stopped boasting about it.
He’d complain to me, “My girlfriend wired me money again. It’s so annoying; I haven’t even spent the last transfer.”
“She keeps doing this. People might think I’m some kind of gold digger.”
When I ignored him, he’d dramatically cover his mouth and lean closer. “Oh, I forgot you’re applying for financial aid. My girlfriend’s rich and she spoils me. You’re not jealous, are you?”
After they started dating online, he replaced all his clothes with designer labels.
A casual dinner for him was now an easy three-figure bill.
His online girlfriend seemed to have severe insomnia and was incredibly clingy.
Calvin would whisper into his phone every night, staying up with her until the early hours.
I was a light sleeper, and the sedatives I took barely got me to sleep, only for me to be woken up by his sudden, loud bursts of laughter.
Multiple times, I almost told him to be quiet.
But I was broke, always up before dawn for my off-campus job, so I felt like I was imposing too, and I couldn't say much to him.
My parents divorced, both remarried, and they stopped supporting me years ago.
I paid my own tuition for college.
I was chronically sleep-deprived at night.
I had to get up early for work in the morning.
Add to that the heavy course load.
Sometimes, I was so exhausted I genuinely felt suicidal.
Even when I was being as quiet as possible.
While the other roommates were still deep asleep.
Calvin suddenly threw his blanket back and swore at me:
“Why do you have to be so extra, waking up before dawn to work? Just to show off how broke you are?”
“If you’re that poor, why don’t you just drop out and find a sugar mama to take care of you? Why be such a martyr?”
I was late for work and didn’t have time to argue.
I worked at a high-end coffee shop downtown.
A stunning woman ordered the most expensive coffee, resting her chin on her hand, watching me intently. She wore a sleek, black trench coat. Her eyes were slightly upturned at the corners, her pupils a beautiful amber, and her expression was distant yet casual.
She was so eye-catching, more beautiful than any celebrity. The moment she entered, she became the focal point of the entire café.
I saw a few people covertly taking pictures of her.
I couldn’t help but sneak a few glances myself.
When I brought her coffee to the table.
She handed me a generous tip, smiling, her voice slow and lazy.
“Working so hard, sweetheart?”
“Why are you working a shift this early? I wire you so much money, is it not enough? Do you need a little extra?”
I was taken aback. “You’ve never sent me money.”
She froze, pulled out her phone, and opened her photo gallery to show me.
It was filled with countless selfies of me.
“Sweetheart, you have a mole on your earlobe. These are your photos, aren’t they?”
“Why are you flirting with me online and then playing dumb in person? You call me ‘wife’ every single night.”
Her smile deepened. “Is this your first time seeing me in person? Are you shy?”
I was stunned. “The photos are definitely mine, but I honestly don't know who you are.”
Now she looked confused, too.
Finally, we pieced together that Calvin had been catfishing her with my photos.
The woman, mortified at being deceived, introduced herself.
She extended her hand to me. “Hi, I’m Lena Vanderbilt. Would you be willing to try dating me?”
I hesitated.
She leaned in, a tempting whisper. “With me, things would be much easier for you.”
In that moment, I admit, I was sold.
Because I was simply too damn tired.

Once we were together, Lena proved to be a very committed partner.
She retrieved all the money Calvin had scammed from her and transferred it to my account.
Before I graduated, she showered me with gifts and surprises.
After graduation, she gave me an executive position in her company, personally mentoring me on projects.
It gave me a resume that many seasoned professionals would envy.
During the day, we were boss and subordinate.
At night, we were like any regular couple—living together, hugging, kissing.
She had incredible stamina; she always left me breathless.
In those moments, she loved to nibble the mole on my earlobe, loved to kiss my eyes, and loved to bury her face in my chest, catching her breath when it was all over.
Because safe sex wasn't always perfect, and Lena craved the rush, sometimes we skipped the protection.
In the heat of the moment, she would tell me:
“Marry me, sweetheart. I only want to marry you.”
“Our baby will definitely be as sweet and well-behaved as you.”
I held her close, believing every word.
I thought we could stay like this forever.
Until that day.
The day I found out she had a fiancé.
I went to the hospital for a routine check-up and, unexpectedly, the results flagged some issues that required further testing.
Panicked and urgent, I didn’t waste a second. I grabbed the papers and rushed to Lena’s office.
My hand was just reaching for the doorknob.
When I heard voices from inside.
“So, you haven’t told Connor you have a fiancé?”
My world went quiet.
I pressed my ear lightly against the door.
Then, I heard Lena’s calm, level voice.
“I don’t even like the fiancé. Besides, it’s just a business arrangement—a calculated alliance set up by our families.”
Her friend asked, “Did you ever consider fighting it?”
Lena laughed, a careless, offhand sound.
“Why would I? Is it even necessary?”
“Besides, isn’t a marriage among equals just the natural order of things? You didn’t seriously think I would end up with a poor kid like Connor, did you? It’s just a bit of fun.”
“And I’m not ready to settle down yet.”
“My fiancé and I have an agreement: we can see other people before the wedding, as long as no one crosses a major line. Anything goes.”
“Connor is obedient. He’s very sweet and pulls at my heartstrings. I don’t mind keeping the act going with him for a bit longer.”
Her friend teased, “You used to swap boyfriends every week. This is the first time I’ve seen you this serious. I actually thought you’d changed.”
“But I get it. Connor has that pure, innocent face. If he were mine, I’d want to keep him close and spoil him, too.”
“But you play the field so much. Aren’t you worried Connor will find out and be heartbroken?”
Lena smiled. “Why should I be? If he finds out, I’ll just give him some money and break up with him.”
“Poor people like him are easy to manage. They’re shortsighted. A decent severance package, and they won't make a fuss.”
In that moment, a massive ringing started in my head. I nearly lost my footing.
I looked down at the check-up paper in my hand.
It felt like I’d been slapped hard across the face.
My cheeks were burning.
The hand I’d placed on the doorknob slowly dropped.
That night, I didn't go home. I hid in a hotel room and cried for a long time.
I realized I might have fallen irrevocably in love with her.
Otherwise, why would I feel this crushing pain?
I loved her, but I hated her just as much.
I thought, Why?
Why did she get to hold all the power in this relationship?
Why could she pick me up and put me down so easily?
Why was she allowed to play, and I was not?
Instead of waiting for Lena to toss me aside, I decided to be the one to end it. I would dump her.
So, I deliberately set up a scene to pretend I was cheating.
When Lena found me at the hotel.
I was in a bathrobe, kissing a woman I’d hired.
Scattered on the floor were unbuttoned shirt studs and a ripped tie.
The bedsheets were strategically messed up with marks I'd faked.
Lena stood in the doorway, the air pressure around her dangerously low.
She wore a terrifying, extremely dangerous smile. “Explain.”
The woman I was kissing spoke up first. “Ms. Vanderbilt, we’re the real soulmates here. You should just let him go.”
“I swear, I’ll treat him well.”
Lena didn't even lift an eyelid. The brief, cold glance she gave the woman was full of undisguised contempt and disgust.
“Get lost. Trash like you doesn’t get a voice here.”
The woman's face instantly flushed crimson. She opened her mouth but couldn't dare utter a single word in protest.
I waited a moment, then spoke slowly.
“It’s exactly what you see. I don’t love you anymore.”
“I’ve already submitted my resignation to the company. I kept all the money you gave me in the bank, untouched.”
“Lena, we’re breaking up.”
That night, Lena stood on the balcony, drinking an entire bottle of scotch.
As she left, she spoke one last, cold sentence: “As you wish.”
Right after that, I blocked and deleted every single one of Lena’s contacts and accounts.

A week later.
Lena came into the convenience store alone this time.
I assumed she was here for condoms again, so I habitually reached for the brand she usually bought.
She didn't take them. She just looked at me. “Connor, can we talk?”
At a nearby five-star restaurant.
Lena ordered fresh quality seafood, the food I used to love.
I looked at the menu and said, “I don’t eat seafood anymore.”
Lena smiled faintly.
“You used to be addicted to spice. Why the change? Is it to accommodate your new girlfriend?”
I lowered my eyes, my tone flat. “My stomach hasn’t been well lately.”
She conceded without judgment and ordered milder dishes instead.
Once the food arrived.
Lena asked me,
“Do you regret breaking up with me?”
“You never had to live this hard before you left. Does she treat you well?”
I said nothing.
She smiled.
“Okay, I get it.”
“After all, I was your first serious relationship. You were still in school when you got with me. Not much experience. It’s normal for you to be a little reckless and ungrateful.”
“So, another woman says a few sweet things, and you’re gone.”
“But life isn't a fairy tale.”
“You see what you look like now that you’ve left me.”
“Six AM to ten PM shifts, a two-hour commute, crowded subway trains, standing all day, and all that tedious, grinding work.”
“Your roommate, Calvin, is now my arm candy, and he’s living the good life. I give him a quarter-million dollar monthly allowance, and I gave you even more than that.”
“That life should have been yours.”
“This is your last chance, Connor. Do you want to get back together?”
I stayed silent for a moment.
Finally, I lifted my gaze. “Ms. Vanderbilt, I’m not like you. I take relationships seriously.”
Lena sneered. “Oh, really? You like her that much?”
Just then, I accidentally bit into a piece of fatty meat.
The burst of oily richness immediately made me nauseous.
I clamped a hand over my mouth, a wave of revulsion washing over me.
Seeing my reaction, Lena leisurely poured me a glass of water. It was half a joke when she said, “Why such a strong reaction? Is your stomach problem flaring up again?”
My grip on the water glass tightened instinctively.
She leaned closer. “Now that I look closely, your color doesn't seem quite right.”
“Connor, is there something you’re hiding from me?”
