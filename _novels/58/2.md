Five days ago, I was diagnosed with brain cancer, only seven days to live. I told Lachlan about the cancer, but he didn't believe me, saying I was pretending to be pitiful like Adeline. Since he didn't believe me, I stopped explaining. The pain in my brain left me weak and limp. Dazed, I heard a knock on the door. Opening it, I found Mrs. Chen, sent by Lachlan with a gift for me—a bouquet of eternal gold roses. He also had Mrs. Chen convey that it was compensation for giving up the new house and my daughter. Mrs. Chen was the only one in the villa who truly cared for me now. She smiled, suppressing her distaste for Adeline, and advised me:

"Mr. Lachlan is just temporarily blinded by a vixen. Sending an expensive gift shows he still cares for you."

"Maybe it'll be better in a few days. Ma'am, just bear with it." I placed the roses in the corner without expression. There were already four identical bouquets of eternal roses there. I nodded perfunctorily. Since Lachlan lied to me, he sent Mrs. Chen with such a bouquet every day. Mrs. Chen couldn't see, but after three years of sharing a bed, how could I not know? He was just trying to ease his guilt, deceiving himself. Even sending flowers was done secretly; he didn't think he was wrong. Looking at the eternal flowers in the corner, only two bouquets left. Once they're gone, I'll likely be gone too. There's no eternity for me...

Brain cancer is truly torturous. After a night of splitting headaches, I barely slept at dawn. Suddenly, my phone rang abruptly, pulling me from sleep. I pressed my temples hard, answering the call from my attending doctor. Dr. Xavier's excited voice rang out:

Mrs. Chen might not notice, but after spending three years by his side, how could I not see through him?

He's just trying to ease his guilt, fooling himself.

Even when he gives flowers, he does it in secret. He doesn't think he's in the wrong at all.

Looking at the Eternal Flowers in the corner, only two bouquets remain.

Once they're gone, so might I be. Where’s the eternity in that...

Brain cancer is truly relentless. After an entire night of a splitting headache, I finally managed to catch some sleep at dawn.

Suddenly, my phone rang, startling me awake.

Pressing hard on my temples, I answered the call from my physician.

Dr. Xavier's excited voice came through:

"Ms. Nora, a new drug that can inhibit brain cancer cells has just been released abroad. Supplies are limited, but I managed to get a bottle through some connections."

"It might help extend your life a bit. If you'd like, come to the hospital to pick it up."

Hearing this, I was overwhelmed with joy. Even if it's just for my daughter, I need to live a few more days.

So I agreed immediately and rushed to the hospital to get the new medicine.

Dr. Xavier specifically reminded me that the new drug is precious and needs to be kept safe.

He said it could help me survive the next two days and maybe extend my life until the next batch is produced.

With tears in my eyes, I paid for the medicine and held it tightly in my hand.

But as soon as I left the pharmacy, I ran into Lachlan and Adeline, who were there to pick up medicine too.

Seeing the medicine in my hand, Lachlan immediately approached me, nervously asking:

"Are you sick? Why are you at the hospital getting medicine?"

Lachlan kept turning me around, trying to figure out what illness I had.

These days, he’s been wavering between me and Adeline, making me think he still cares about me.

I couldn’t help but find it amusing and casually told the truth:

"Yeah, cancer, only a few days left to live."

Lachlan froze for a moment, but Adeline reacted first, bursting into tears:

"Sister, you know I have cancer and live in pain every day, yet you joke about it with me."

"Yeah, if I die sooner, I won't burden Brother Lachlan with taking care of me. I'm just a wretched short-lived ghost! Let me die!"

She said this and tried to climb out of the corridor window, but Lachlan stopped her instantly.

Lachlan was both angry and heartbroken, turning to scold me harshly:

"Nora, why do you keep using cancer to provoke Addie? You're living just fine. Do you know how tormenting illness is?"

"You're so selfish, acting like you're dying all the time. Even the King of the Underworld wouldn't take someone like you! You're blind!"

With that, he grabbed the medicine from my hand, speaking angrily:

"I want to see what kind of life-threatening disease you really have!"

"Don't touch my medicine!"

Knowing how precious the new drug is, I panicked and rushed to get it back.

But Lachlan pushed me away, seeing the blank label on the bottle.

The drug is still in the trial phase, so there's no label on the bottle.

Adeline sneered at me:

"Sister, if you're faking cancer, at least write something on the prop bottle. How crude. How can Brother Lachlan believe you?"

"Brother Lachlan, who knows what's in there. We can't let her take it. What if it kills her?"

I shot her a cold glance, gritting my teeth:

"If I die from it, what... does it matter to you..."

Before I could finish, Lachlan had already tossed the bottle out the window with a wave of his hand.

Outside the window was the artificial lake!
