I stood outside the door, feeling like I’d been struck by lightning, cold to the bone.

On the other side, a woman's screams rang out, then gradually subsided.

Phoebe's voice was still laced with seduction:

"You didn’t touch her, did you? You promised me, in these last days, you’re mine alone, only crazy for me!"

Nolan let out a satisfied laugh.

"Such a little temptress, who was just begging for mercy?"

Before I could make sense of it, the door opened before me.

Nolan's hair was disheveled, and there was a faint lipstick mark on his collarbone.

The man standing before me carried a distinct scent.

Nausea hit me hard, my stomach churning with morning sickness.

Nolan, still looking pleased, was visibly startled to see me.

His expression turned awkward as he noticed my pale face.

In a voice still husky with desire, he asked cautiously:

"Adeline? How long have you been standing there?"

His Adam's apple bobbed—a sign of his unease.

I dug my fingers into my palm, forcing a strained smile.

"I was just about to knock."

My throat tightened, and I looked away to control my trembling.

"Nolan, I came to ask where you put my calcium tablets. Are you meeting with a guest?"

Now was not the time for confrontation.

Nolan visibly relaxed, clearing his throat.

Before he could answer, Phoebe peeked out from behind him, playfully sticking out her tongue:

"Adeline, I have some here."

She pulled out a bottle of calcium tablets, giggling as she handed it to me.

"Nolan knows I hate drinking milk, so he's been stuffing my bag with these since we were kids."

She stomped her foot happily:

"He's so annoying! The house is full of them, and I can't finish them."

Phoebe, the daughter of Nolan's family maid, grew up with him.

Seeing the familiar pink bottle, I was at a loss.

Nolan had once leaned against my belly, proudly handing me this bottle.

"I had these calcium tablets specially made for you. Be sure to take them."

He'd said they were precious, only one bottle a month.

I chuckled to myself.

Inside, I felt barren.

What moved me was merely someone else's leftover.

Seeing I didn't take it, Nolan looked displeased.

"What's your problem now? Who are you giving attitude to?"

"Am I giving you too much leeway? You're making things hard for Phoebe."

In public, Nolan was always accommodating to me, but I was never to upset Phoebe.

I used to think it was childhood friendship. Now, I realize I was naive.

Five years of marriage, and my husband had his heart elsewhere.

Five months pregnant, I was just a vessel.

The illusion of happiness from a minute ago was now ashes.

I looked at the man before me, who was clearly biased, feeling only disappointment.

I gently caressed my slightly swollen belly, speaking in a low voice:

"Nolan, it really hurts."

My shoulders shook, tears rolling uncontrollably.

"It hurts so much."

Maybe my face looked really bad.

Nolan's dissatisfaction faded, replaced by nervousness.

He warmed his hands, cautiously placing them on my belly.

I felt no warmth from his palm.

A wave of sorrow engulfed me, leaving me sobbing and breathless.

Nolan, helpless, helped me sit down, wiping my tears with concern.

He squatted in front of me, looking up:

"Is it hurting badly?"

My tears fell like rain, and I choked out:

"Nolan, the doctor said my eggs weren't good. How did I get pregnant with IVF this time?"

For a child of ours, I'd been to the hospital countless times, my hands covered in needle marks.

Hormone pills were my meals, and my hair fell out in clumps.

The large egg retrieval needle made my whole body tremble with pain.

Now I'm told this hard-won embryo is my husband's and someone else's.
