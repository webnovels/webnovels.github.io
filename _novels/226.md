I died the year I loved him most.  

He said he could let go of his fortune, and he did.  

He stayed with me as we perished in the flames.  

When I opened my eyes again, I found myself back ten years ago.  

We had just gotten married, and I despised him.  

I rushed to his company, saw him for the first time, and choked out, "Jasper, I'm sorry."  

After a brief pause, he looked calm, "Tell me, how do you plan to hurt me this time?"
