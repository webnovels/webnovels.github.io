Five-year-old Emma immediately understood my meaning. She jumped up and down excitedly, clapping her hands, and looked up at me to whisper:

"Is it that handsome uncle who always takes me to the carnival?"

I forced a smile and nodded at her.

Seeing us smiling instead of getting angry, Lucas, who was affectionately holding little Lily, frowned, seemingly displeased:

"What are you two whispering about?"

Seeing that I had no intention of answering him, the man's tone turned cold again:

"It's settled then. I'm sure you understand the situation. Rachel and I have known each other since childhood. You're just getting in the way. Since you've given birth to my child, I won't abandon you, but remember to behave yourself."

Emma and I had waited for Lucas for five years. I had to comfort her almost every day, telling her that her daddy was just working abroad and would be back soon.

Countless times, I saw the longing in Emma's eyes when she saw other children with their fathers. She even developed autism because of it. My heart ached as if it was being squeezed.

If it weren't for Rachel's ex-fiancé taking care of us, Emma's autism might have gotten worse.

But after enduring these five years, what we got was Lucas returning with Rachel and their daughter, demanding that I become their housekeeper.

Although Emma liked her new dad, seeing Lucas, her biological father, holding another little girl, she couldn't help but show a pitiful expression of envy.

Lucas noticed Emma's gaze and handed Lily to Rachel before crouching down to caress Emma's little face.

But the next second, Lily ran over and scratched Emma's face, leaving a bloody mark. She pouted arrogantly:

"This is my daddy, you can't steal my daddy!"

Emma endured the pain with the scratch on her face, biting her lip to hold back tears. Her eyes were brimming with unshed tears.

Growing up without a father's companionship had taught her to be strong beyond her years.

She seemed to know that she didn't have a father to stand up for her, but as her mother, my chest hurt so much I could barely breathe.

I turned my gaze to Lucas, who remained unmoved. He instinctively shielded Lily behind him and defended her:

"It's just children being naughty. Are you really going to make a fuss over this? That's enough."

Hearing his completely biased words, I lowered my head and laughed bitterly.

Why did I still feel disappointed when I knew this would be his attitude...

When Lily tried to run over to hit Emma again, Lucas stopped her with a look. She halted in her tracks.

Rachel knowingly took Lily into her arms and deliberately raised her voice:

"Don't be angry, sweetie. Daddy built a princess fairy tale kingdom especially for your birthday, and even bought you a star. Even your little braids today were done by daddy. Of course, daddy only loves you, his one and only daughter."

After saying this, Rachel, who was crouching down, tugged at Lucas's pant leg and blinked her eyes, asking:

"Lucas, am I right?"
