"Look at this, isn't the scenery amazing?" The entire family was gathered in the living room, admiring the scenic photos my son had found online. That's when I realized I had been reborn.

Reborn on the very day my son suggested we visit the mysterious Crimson Lake in Cyprus. It's beautiful but perilous; the water is highly corrosive. My mother-in-law glanced at me.

She was concerned for my son's safety too, but didn't want to spoil his excitement and wanted me to be the one to voice concerns. That's how it was in my previous life. After I gently advised him, my son and I had a huge argument. This time, I was eager for him to leave as soon as possible. "Son, I support your trip. You're young, you should explore the world."

"Mom, you're the best," my son said, kissing me excitedly. My mother-in-law was surprised by my attitude and pursed her lips in disapproval. "Grandson, going abroad alone is too dangerous."

"Grandma, please, don't meddle if you don't understand." In this house, my son ruled. One word from him, and my mother-in-law was silenced. My husband was glued to his phone, showing no interest in intervening. "Don't worry, Mom. I'll get Ethan the best communication gear, it'll be safe." My mother-in-law shot me a dirty look but kept quiet, afraid her beloved grandson might storm out.
