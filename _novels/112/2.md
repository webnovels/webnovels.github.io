I transferred twenty thousand yuan to Ethan to help him buy equipment. My mother-in-law didn't dare criticize me openly but complained to my husband about my spending in private. Hugo and I started dating in college.

We were at the same university but in different programs. We both interned in Beijing, dreaming of making it big in the city. But Hugo was naturally more laid-back. He disliked the fast-paced city life and took me back to his hometown. My mother-in-law believed I ruined her son's promising future.

For years after our marriage, she never treated me well.

Things only improved slightly after Ethan was born. Ethan said twenty thousand wasn't enough, so I immediately sent him another fifty thousand, making my mother-in-law furious. I just wanted Ethan to leave content.

The travel companions he mentioned were local troublemakers. In my past life, they robbed me and tried to kill me to keep it quiet. To survive, Ethan followed their plan and pushed me into the lake. This time, I'm not going.

Someone else will meet their fate at Crimson Lake.

The more extravagant Ethan's gear, the more likely they are to strike.

Within a week, I had transferred nearly a hundred thousand yuan to Ethan.

He was so pleased he nearly forgot himself, eagerly applying for his visa to Cyprus. "Your mom said she's never been abroad and wants to go with you," my mother-in-law suggested nervously on the day we applied for the visa.

Ethan's smile froze, his affectionate "loving mommy" demeanor vanished. "Ethan, I'm not going.

I have to work overtime for the next two months, no time for travel." Ethan's expression softened, and he said to my mother-in-law with annoyance, "Grandma, can you stop interfering? I'm an adult now."

"Grandma is just worried about you." "Worried, my foot. Don't pretend to understand what you don't." Even though my mother-in-law spoiled Ethan from a young age, Ethan didn't like her. I once thought he resented how she treated me, so he took it out on her.

After being submerged in the dark red lake, I understood that Ethan only loves himself.
