Ten days before departure, Cora visited. Her face was bruised and swollen, clearly just beaten.

She's Hugo's sister, married to a wealthy businessman. When she first got married, my mother-in-law bragged to everyone about how exceptional her daughter was and how great her husband was. It seemed Cora's excellence could only be shown through marriage.

Her husband indeed treated her well.

He bought her designer bags and cosmetics, spoiling her like a princess. At that time, Cora would mock me, saying my attire screamed "poor." She even had the maid bring me the trash they cleaned up, saying it was to broaden my horizons.

She seemed to forget she was born into this "poor" family. Her father, in his sixties, still worked odd jobs on construction sites. He died in an accident, and the contractor compensated a large sum. That's how the Aiden family's life became comfortable.

This house was bought with Hugo's father's life. "What happened this time?" My mother-in-law applied ice to Cora's face, heartbroken. "He said I used his money to keep a gigolo." Cora cried bitterly. She did have a history.

Her husband worked long hours, leaving her alone at home. Over time, Cora got restless and indulged in nightclub services. She was caught in the act by her husband, beaten from the club to home. Since then, she's been abused regularly and comes to my mother-in-law to cry. My mother-in-law, after comforting her, would only tell her to "endure." This endurance lasted five or six years. During which, Cora was beaten to the point of miscarriage. My mother-in-law still wouldn't let her divorce.

This time, before my mother-in-law could advise her to endure, I quickly interjected. "Why don't you also come along to relax, Cora?" Hearing she could go to Cyprus, Cora's eyes lit up but slowly dimmed. "Traveling abroad costs a lot.

I don't dare use his money." The wealthy lady who once looked down on me now worries about money. "Your sister-in-law has it.

She's very generous. Right, Blair?" The mother and daughter looked at me in unison. "If Cora wants to go, I can give another ten thousand yuan." "Ten thousand! You gave Ethan so much, but only ten thousand for Cora!"

When it comes to her daughter, my mother-in-law doesn't mind spending money. "If ten thousand isn't enough, I'll give fifty thousand." Go ahead, take it. After all, the money I give isn't mine.
