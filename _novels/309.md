In my previous life, I chose the leopard-man, while my cousin got the merman.
The leopard-man fell deeply in love with my cousin. He watched coldly as I was torn to pieces, then used the crystal earned from my life to curry favor with her.
In my last life, I stayed away from the leopard-man and chose the merman instead.
Little did I know that the merman would also be attracted to my cousin. He conspired with her to drown me, then threw himself into her arms.
Now I've been reborn again.
Faced with these two beast-men that my mother strongly recommends, I don't want to choose either of them.
Just as I'm struggling with how to choose, a black shadow flashes by my side.
Overjoyed, I catch it and declare on the spot: "I want this one!"
Then without waiting for anyone's reaction, I quickly form a contract with it.
"Damn it!"
As the silver light symbolizing the completed contract flashes, a voice simultaneously echoes in my mind.
"Contracting with me, are you trying to die again?"
My cousin Lily is a year younger than me. She should have chosen her beast-man a year later, but she was so favored by the family elders that she persuaded them to let her choose a year early.
To choose at the same time as me.
Of the two beast-men my mother had carefully selected for me, one would now have to go to my cousin.
"Aria, just choose whichever one you want," my mother said.
That's exactly what I did two lives ago.
I chose the leopard-man, who had the strongest speed and power in the family, while my cousin got the merman.
But after contracting with me, the leopard-man was always in poor condition.
I thought he just needed time to adjust, so I wanted to give him some time.
But I never expected that after watching me be torn to pieces by other beast-men, the leopard-man would leap up and quickly kill them with a strength I had never seen before.
He looked at my corpse without any remorse:
"The biggest mistake you made was choosing me, making me miss out on Lily."
It turned out the leopard-man had always liked my cousin, and even resented me for it.
So in my last life, after being reborn, I chose the merman without hesitation.
The merman had a gentle personality, surely he couldn't do anything to me.
But I never imagined that the merman would also fall in love with Lily.
For her sake, the supposedly gentle merman tricked me to the waters where he grew up and conspired with his people to drown me.
After my death, he sat by the water, eyes downcast.
"I'm sorry, but I really like Lily. I like her to the point of madness."
This time, I've been reborn again.
Directly reborn to the moment of choosing a beast-man.
Right now, the family elders are impatiently urging me: "Aria, how long are you going to dawdle? Lily is still waiting behind you!"
I looked at the fierce-looking leopard-man, then glanced at the merman who was secretly looking at Lily, and my head started to ache.
I quietly asked my mother if I could not choose.
Mother firmly said: "No."
"Aria, are you worried about their strength? These are the ones I personally selected. This leopard-man is the most talented genius in history in terms of speed and strength, while the merman is the prince of their clan, with a high chance of becoming the Merman King in the future."
The situation was urgent, and I had no way to explain to my mother what had happened to me.
"Aria, just choose. Lily can only have the one you don't pick."
Mother's eyes swept around, her words full of intimidation.
"I know many people in the family look down on me, but they don't have the power to make decisions over me yet."
But even though mother said this, I couldn't not choose a beast-man.
This was a long-standing rule in our magical family. Every member needed to choose a beast-man at the contract ceremony.
If I just left without following the rules, my mother would definitely be harassed by those old geezers using this as an excuse.
But these two beast-men wouldn't stay with me wholeheartedly. As long as they fell in love with Lily, my life would still be in danger.
Just as I was struggling with which beast-man would be easier to deal with.
A black shadow flashed by.
Long and thin, extremely fast, no one noticed it except me.
A small snake of unknown species that couldn't shapeshift, but with the unique magical fluctuations of a beast-man.
Overjoyed, I caught it and announced on the spot: "I want this one!"
Then without waiting for anyone's reaction, I quickly formed a contract with it.
"Damn it!"
As the silver light symbolizing the completed contract flashed, a voice simultaneously echoed in my mind.
"Contracting with me, are you trying to die again?"
When I opened my eyes, everyone was looking at me with various expressions.
Lily couldn't contain her excitement and said loudly:
"Cousin, after all that fuss, you just chose a little broken snake?"
An elder shouted in dissatisfaction: "Aria, this is the contract ceremony, are you mocking us?"
I raised my hand to show them the faint silver mark on my wrist. them
"How am I mocking you? Didn't I contract a beast-man?"
Seeing I mocking you? the unique imprint symbolizing the contract between our family and beast-men, they finally believed that the little snake in my hand was really a beast-man.
They reluctantly shut up.
Next it was Lily's turn to choose a beast-man.
Only then did I have time to pick up the little snake in an unnoticed place.
"Just now you said 'die again', what did you mean by that?"
"You have the nerve to ask?"
The snake didn't open its mouth, but its voice sounded directly in my mind.
A magnetic, deep male voice, gritting his teeth.
"My powers have plummeted, and I'm forcibly bound to you, unable to leave a single step."
"In your last life, and the life before that, you died twice, and I died with you twice!"
"Each time, it was just when I was about to regain my peak power!"
"This time I didn't want to be manipulated by you anymore and was about to leave first, but you actually caught me and contracted with me?!"
