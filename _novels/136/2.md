The stinking clothes made her cough, and Declan quickly pulled her behind him.

"Mom! What are you doing?!"

"Lily was kind enough to help you, how can you bully her like that?"

"If you keep this up, my brother and I will completely ignore you!"

After speaking, he turned to comfort his wife. But I didn't listen to him, only shouted hoarsely to Lily.

"Run, they'll bully you! They're bad people..."

They're bad people. Heath and the director are in cahoots! They electroshock my paralyzed old partner; they pin me down on him and violate me. They don't allow him to close his eyes. They say I'm a hen that can't lay eggs, cut open my belly... in the end, reduced me to a slave of the entire psychiatric hospital.

I frantically pushed Lily. Everyone was shocked by this scene, and Heath looked even more displeased, forcing a smile as he came over, warning me in a low voice.

"Don't forget your old partner!"

I trembled, quickly undoing my pants:

"I'll do it... I'm the best at having sons, I'll give you one!"

As I spoke, I looked at Lily, silently mouthing for her to run. At this moment, Declan finally sensed something was wrong. Just as he was about to ask, Heath quickly took off his clothes and forcibly tied them on me.

"Don't make trouble, sister-in-law. I know Declan is a vegetable now, and you're lonely, but I can't cheat on him!"

"I won't do anything to betray Declan!"

Seeing this, Declan pushed me to the ground, his face filled with unbearable anger:

"You're so disrespectful!"

"How could Dad marry such a disgusting woman like you!"

"Exactly!" Dylan immediately chimed in, looking at me helplessly.

"Mom, calm down. One minute you're abusing Dad, the next you're accusing the hospital of mistreating you, tarnishing its reputation."

"Truly, the dirty-minded see everything as dirty."

I knelt painfully on the ground, not daring to speak. Seeing this, Declan thought I was guilty, coldly snorting, "Seems you haven't learned well!"

"At your age, letting you out would be a disaster! Uncle Heath not only takes care of you, but also Dad."

"But you're harming him, truly vicious. I'll take Dad away, and you'll stay here for life!"

"Who knows what a malicious old thing like you would do to him!"

He finished speaking and turned to ask the director and Heath.

"Where's Dad?"

The director's legs went soft, standing there, not knowing what to do. Declan sensed something was wrong, his face darkening:

"I've been away for years, but I send ten thousand a month to your hospital. Don't tell me you don't even know where my dad is!"

"If you're really mistreating the elderly, believe me, I'll call the media to investigate thoroughly!"

Hearing the word "media," the director and Heath were dizzy, almost fainting! Dylan saw their pleading eyes and immediately stepped in to smooth things over.

"Bro, don't scare them."

"They've been honest all their lives; they get tongue-tied when nervous."

"Dad's an adult, he's not going missing."

"Besides, with Mom's personality, if she didn't want to, who could hide Dad under her nose? I bet only Mom knows."

He finished speaking, turning to me with a pleading look.

"Please, Mom, bring Dad out. He's too old for this."

"Look at Uncle Heath and the director; they've been honest all their lives. Can you bear to ruin their reputation?"

No wonder they're brothers; Declan immediately got Dylan's point, storming over to me, gripping my shoulders tightly.

"Old woman, don't you find yourself ridiculous?"

"Throwing tantrums over dissatisfaction, do you think my brother and I are still kids?!"

At this moment, the director's eyes twitched, about to say something, when a patient on break wandered into the cafeteria. Seeing me, he laughed, revealing yellow teeth.

"Old woman, your old man seems done for, lying on the ground, not moving!"
