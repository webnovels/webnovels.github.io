Two months into my roommate catfishing someone online with my photos, a stream of bullet comments scrolled across the edge of my vision:
【The male lead has already rejected the female lead’s invitation to meet up three times.】
【He can’t help it. He’s using his roommate’s photos to date her online. He’s so average-looking and insecure, he doesn’t dare take that step to meet in person.】
【Don’t worry, male lead. As soon as you meet her and explain the situation, she’ll forgive you. Then the rest of the book is just sweet, sweet romance. Friendly reminder—the female lead is a gorgeous, loaded heiress.】
Before the comments finished scrolling, my roommate, Ryan, peeked his head down from the top bunk, showing off with a smug grin.
"Leo, my girlfriend just sent me more money!"
He let out a dramatic sigh. "Man, having a girlfriend this rich... I hope you guys don't get too jealous."
I raised an eyebrow.
The girlfriend he got using my photos?
Well, starting now, she's my girlfriend.

1
A phone dangled in front of my face.
I could clearly see the screen: a transfer for one thousand dollars.
The memo read:
【For my darling hubby to order some takeout.】
Only after he was sure I’d seen the amount did Ryan Cole pull his phone back, hastily tapping "accept." He then sent a voice message.
【Thanks for feeding me, wifey.】
The bullet comments started scrolling again, faster this time:
【OMG, their love story is so cute. They haven’t even met, but their romance is so sweet. The classic domineering CEO and the clueless college guy trope.】
【It's been two months. When are they finally going to meet?】
【He really shouldn't worry so much about his looks. The female lead might be a little surprised at first, but she gets over it fast.】
【Don't rush him, he's trying to lose weight! He's planning to meet her after he loses another fifteen pounds.】
Fifteen pounds?
I glanced up at Ryan's back as he sat on his bunk, stuffing his face with snacks.
Two months ago, on a whim, he’d stood in the middle of our dorm room and sworn he would finally lose weight. For the first few days, he barely ate and went for a run every evening, returning to the room panting and drenched in sweat.
Unfortunately, that lasted all of three days.
One night, starving and miserable, he caved at the smell of fried chicken and devoured an entire bucket.
His diet ended in failure. In fact, thanks to the binge eating, he’d actually gained five pounds, pushing him past the two-hundred-pound mark.
I changed into a crisp white casual outfit. The tailored fit made the man in the mirror look sharp and effortlessly handsome. Then, I asked casually, "Have you and your girlfriend met yet?"

2
The bullet comments seemed annoyed:
【Why is the camera on the villain? So what if he's handsome?】
【Exactly. Even though the male lead is using his photos, our female lead isn't shallow. A person's inner qualities are what's important.】
The comments were a dense, scrolling wall of text.
It was only then that I understood. I was the villain in a sappy romance novel.
In the story, the male lead uses my photos to date the female lead. When they finally meet, she’s initially shocked that he looks nothing like his pictures, but she quickly accepts reality and they begin their "sweet romance." To prove that she loves him for his personality and not his looks, she even goes out of her way to destroy my family's company.
In the end, penniless and alone, I starve to death in a rented attic room.
The main couple's love, having been "tested," becomes stronger than ever.
No one gives a second thought to the stepping stone—me—who got crushed in the path of their love story.
But wait.
If looks don't matter, why didn't Ryan just use his own photo?
Up on his bunk, his body tensed.
"We haven't met," he mumbled, "but we've exchanged pictures."
He then added defensively, "Leo, don't tell me you're jealous I have such a rich girlfriend?"
He let out another sigh, dripping with condescension. "It's a shame, really. You're so much better looking than me, and your family's well off, but you still can't land a girl with money."
I styled my hair in the mirror, unfazed.
"Why would I be jealous?"
"It would be great if you could bring her around to meet all of us sometime."
Ryan choked on his words, changing the subject. He looked me up and down, a flash of envy in his eyes.
"Hey Leo, take a selfie and send it to me."
Afraid I’d refuse, he quickly added, "I... I just wanted to have a photo of my roommate, you know, for the memories."
I agreed without hesitation.
"Sure, one second."
As soon as he got the photo, Ryan curled up on his bunk like a rolly-poly. He immediately sent the picture to the person he was chatting with.
【Just took a new selfie. How do I look?】

3
A flurry of notification chimes echoed from his phone, signaling the other person's excitement.
So much for not caring about looks.
I glanced at the bullet comments one last time.
【Sigh, when will he ever get over his insecurity? He sent the villain's selfie again.】
【She really doesn't care what you look like! You'll see when you meet her.】
【I remember this part of the plot. Later, when the villain finds out, he can't stand the thought of letting such a rich and beautiful girl go. He actually runs to the female lead and says, 'I'm the guy in the photos!'】
【And you know what happens? His pathetic, desperate attempts to get between them just make their relationship stronger.】
【Haha, the female lead is the sole heiress to the Walton Corporation. You think she'd be shallow enough to only care about looks? The villain totally deserves to get taught a lesson and starve to death. He's nothing but a stepping stone for their love.】
I absorbed the key information from the comments.
Heiress to the Walton Corporation, huh?
Noted.
But we’ll see who the real stepping stone is.
It was Saturday, no classes.
As I was leaving the dorm, Ryan asked offhandedly, "No class today. Where are you off to?"
A smile played on my lips.
"Met a really nice girl recently. Going to see her."

The Walton Corporation headquarters wasn't hard to find.
On the way over, I’d already found pictures of Fiona Walton online. There were only a few, all low-resolution, but they couldn't hide the smooth line of her jaw or her elegant, high-bridged nose.
She really was a gorgeous, loaded heiress.
My finger traced the outline of her smiling face on my phone screen. I set it down, my knuckles tapping lightly on the tabletop. The cup of coffee beside me had gone cold.
My seat in the café had a direct view of the Walton Corp entrance.
It seemed the bullet comments were tethered to Ryan's perspective; they had no idea where I was. Right now, they were buzzing.
【Even though the female lead is so busy, she still makes time to chat with him. This is the kind of doting love story I live for.】
【It's almost evening. She has to go to dinner, or she'd keep talking to him.】
【Ugh, just meet already! I can't wait any longer!】
I straightened up, my eyes glued to the entrance of the building.
A stream of well-dressed men and women poured out. Among them, Fiona Walton was a standout. The moment she appeared, heads turned.
I had to admit, Ryan had good taste.
He’d found me… a very nice girlfriend.
I quickly got up and left the café.
Just as I was about to pass the fast-walking Fiona, I deliberately brushed against her shoulder.
She stumbled, losing her balance and starting to fall.
On instinct, I reached out, my arm wrapping around her slim waist to steady her.
Our eyes met.
A look of delighted surprise crossed her face.
"It's you!"

5
I quickly helped her regain her footing and let go, a faint blush creeping up my cheeks as I looked down.
"I'm so sorry," I said, my voice sincere. "I'm in a hurry, so I was walking a bit too fast. I didn't hurt you, did I?"
My eyes held the perfect mix of alarm and concern. Nothing else.
I didn't recognize her.
That realization seemed to throw Fiona off for a moment, but she quickly found an explanation. He had only sent her a few photos, most of them taken from a distance. It was understandable that he wouldn't recognize her after a sudden, real-life encounter.
But she recognized me.
Ever since they'd met on the app and exchanged numbers, 'Star Gazer' had frequently sent her selfies. In every photo, the man had a brilliant smile, a great physique, and a gentle, stylish wardrobe that made him look sunny and handsome.
Unfortunately, she had suggested meeting up three times, and each time, 'Star Gazer' had refused without a second thought. He wouldn't even tell her which university he attended. For countless nights, her only comfort was scrolling through his pictures.
She never expected fate to be so kind as to let her run into the man from her dreams.
Seeing the undisguised admiration in her eyes, I hid a smile and feigned anxiety.
"Miss, I just finished my part-time job and I'm trying to get back to Northwood University. If I don't leave now, I'll miss the last bus."
Without waiting for her reply, I turned and walked away, disappearing into the growing darkness.
Fiona reached out to stop me but grasped only empty air.
Her gaze followed my retreating figure, her lips silently repeating the words.
Northwood University.

By the time I got back to the dorm, the sky was full of stars.
The bullet comments were once again gushing over the sweet romance.
【Wow, the female lead is especially chatty today. She can't stop talking to him.】
【Yeah, and she keeps asking if he's tired. Haha, little does she know, our boy Ryan has been lying in bed all day.】
【She just sent him a thousand dollars this morning, and now she sent another thousand, saying she's worried he's working too hard.】
【This girl is seriously loaded.】
Just as I pushed the door open, Ryan was climbing down from his bunk.
Seeing me, he raised his voice, a mixture of complaint and showing off.
"Ugh, why did she send me more money? How am I ever going to spend all of this?"
"Oh, Leo, you're back? Perfect timing. Help me pick out a watch. Which one should I get?"
As he spoke, he stared intently at me, searching for any sign of jealousy.
He found none.
I enthusiastically pointed to a model encrusted with diamonds.
"Get that one. It's a classic design, very versatile."
Ryan nodded, satisfied. As he placed the order, he asked nonchalantly, "So, how was that girl you met today?"
I answered slowly, "She was nice."
"Nice?" He scoffed, glancing at my empty hands. "She didn't even buy you a gift? You're still going to see someone that cheap?"
"My girlfriend is way better. She never hesitates to send money."
Ever since we started college, from the first moment Ryan saw me, he’d made it his mission to compete with me. Academics, looks, family background—he lost on every front. So, he turned his attention to dating apps, hoping to snag a rich girl and finally one-up me.
Landing Fiona had been a massive boost to his ego.
After his little display, Ryan climbed back onto his bunk and started tapping furiously at his phone screen.
My other roommate, Jake, came over and tugged on my arm, rolling his eyes at the giggling figure above us.
"Don't mind him," he whispered. "Ever since he got this rich girlfriend, he's been insufferable. It's so annoying."
"So how's the girl you met? Are you seeing her again tomorrow?"
Ryan, oblivious, was still sending voice messages.
"My wifey is the best!"
"Love you, mwah!"
A knowing smile touched my lips.
Of course I was seeing her tomorrow.
Otherwise, someone might get impatient.

The next day was Sunday. No classes.
I was up early, getting ready to head out. As soon as I stepped out of the university gates, I saw a luxury car parked at the entrance.
It was Fiona’s.
Perhaps not wanting to cause a scene with the few students walking by, she got out of the car to wait. Her stunning appearance drew more than a few stares.
She saw me and waved from a distance.
I walked over, feigning confusion.
She smiled. "I bumped into you yesterday, so I wanted to apologize properly today. Can I give you a ride to your part-time job?"
I was the one who bumped into her, but she was taking the blame, using it as a flimsy excuse to talk to me.
"That... that's not necessary," I hesitated. "I can just take the bus."
Fiona had already opened the passenger door for me.
"It's no problem. My office isn't far from where you work. It's on the way."
After a moment's pause, I got into the car, trying to look awkward and flustered.
Fiona seemed to be in a good mood. With one hand on the steering wheel, she asked with a hint of curiosity, "The workload at Northwood is pretty heavy. Why are you working a part-time job on the weekends?"
I tilted my head, giving her a playful smile. "My parents want me to learn to be independent, so my allowance isn't very big. I'm just trying to make a little extra cash."
The confusion on her face deepened. She had just sent me two thousand dollars in one day. How could I possibly be short on money?
But she didn't press the issue.
The car pulled up in front of a coffee shop. It was the job I had found just yesterday.
I went behind the counter and, under the manager's guidance, started grinding coffee beans.
Fiona didn't leave. She took a seat at the table closest to the counter and ordered an iced Americano.
I brought the coffee to her table with a smile.
Suddenly, she asked, "The... ahem... the Patek Philippe watch I sent you. Why aren't you wearing it?"

8
I remembered that watch.
The first week after Ryan announced he had a girlfriend, he received a luxury watch. He was obsessed with it, turning it over and over in his hands.
He'd even sent a saccharine voice message:
"Baby, I'll wear it forever."
And indeed, the watch was still firmly on his wrist.
But what did any of that have to do with me?
I shook my head, feigning confusion.
"What watch? I've never owned a watch."
Fiona froze. A few drops of coffee splashed onto the back of her hand, but she didn't seem to notice.
I turned and went back to the counter to grind more beans.
The rich aroma of coffee filled the air. A burning gaze was fixed on my back, unmoving.
She downed the coffee in one gulp.
I suddenly turned back to her, a faint smile on my face.
"Miss, would you like a refill on that iced Americano?"
Caught off guard, Fiona's eyes darted away. "Uh... yes... a refill..." she stammered.
I refilled her cup and brought it back.
As she took it, Fiona looked at me, a sudden realization dawning on her.
My voice was nothing like the one in the voice messages. The man in front of her had a cooler, clearer tone, while the voice she chatted with was deeper, more muffled.
His personality seemed different, too.
The man in front of her was shyer, more reserved than the one in the messages.
Her eyes fell on the name tag pinned to my shirt.
Her voice rose an octave.
"Your name is Leo Beckett?"
That wasn't right.
The guy in her messages was named Ryan Cole.

9
Fiona quickly opened her messaging app and tapped on Ryan Cole's profile.
Yes. All the photos were of the man standing in front of her. Every smile, every expression, was etched into her memory.
But there were so many differences. Personality, voice, even his name.
As she hesitated, a new message popped up on her screen:
【Fifi, what are you doing? Thinking of you today, like every day.】
Fiona's gaze shot back to me.
I was looking at her with a gentle, questioning smile. My phone was nowhere in sight.
So, who was sending her messages?
Fiona's hands began to tremble.
"Miss, are you alright?" I asked, my voice full of concern.
Fiona suppressed the suspicion rising in her chest. "I'm fine, I just..."
I turned and brought her a freshly made cappuccino. "I just made this. Please, have a taste. It's on me."
As she took the cup, her fingers brushed against mine. They were as hot as burning coals. The brief contact left her wanting more.
She drank the coffee like it was water, gulping it down. The bitterness was gone, replaced by the sweet, creamy taste of milk that filled her mouth.
She had already had three cups of coffee today. Her mind was sharp.
Seeing that I was about to leave, Fiona jumped up and pulled out her phone.
"Mr. Beckett, can I have your number?"
Her gaze was intense.
I hesitated for a moment before taking out my phone to add her as a contact.
She thoughtfully typed in her own name for me—
Fiona Walton.

10
Fiona was very active over the next week.
She was always finding excuses to chat with me on the app, and we talked about everything under the sun. Every conversation ended with both of us wanting more.
But, as she had said, my studies at Northwood were demanding. I often wouldn't see her morning messages until late at night. Yet, the moment I replied, she would respond instantly, as if she'd been waiting by her phone all day.
It was a busy week for me.
For Ryan, who slept in the bunk across from mine, it was a week of growing anxiety.
He was constantly on his phone, furiously typing. But after he sent a message, there was no satisfying chime of a reply. He grew more and more agitated.
Even the bullet comments were confused.
【What's up with the female lead these past few days? Why is she ignoring him?】
【Yeah, Ryan has sent her a bunch of messages and she's barely replied.】
【Come on, she runs a huge company. She has to make money to spoil him, right? She can't be available 24/7.】
This went on until Saturday, the day of my part-time job.
But I didn't leave campus.
Instead, I slept in, enjoying a rare, long rest.
Around ten in the morning, a message came through.
Fiona: 【Leo, you didn't go to the coffee shop this morning?】
Me: 【I caught a bit of a cold, so I called in sick. Is everything okay, Miss Walton?】
Fiona's fingers paused over her screen. She quickly typed a reply, trying to sound casual.
【Oh, it's nothing. I was just passing by your university and thought I'd give you a ride to work.】
She was lying.
She had clearly been waiting all morning and hadn't seen me. The Walton Corporation and Northwood University were on opposite ends of the city. There was no way she was just "passing by."
I didn't reply to that message.
Instead, I got out of bed, tidied myself up, and took a selfie.
I made sure to look pitiful and lethargic. The caption read:
【Caught a cold. Feeling awful.】

11
Shortly after I posted it, Jake rubbed his sleepy eyes and asked, "Leo, you have a cold?"
I sniffled. "A little one. It's not too bad."
From his bunk, Ryan glanced at me, then started tapping away on his phone.
The bullet comments erupted with laughter:
【Haha, the male lead is posting about being sick on purpose. Now the female lead will have to take a break from her busy schedule for him.】
【Poor guy. She hasn't had any time for him all week.】
【Let me see... a month ago, he said he sprained his ankle running, and she got so worried she sent him a ton of supplements and a thousand dollars to 'rest and recover.'】
【Too bad he had the packages delivered to a convenience store off-campus. He had to lug all those boxes back to the dorm himself.】
【I wonder what she'll send this time!】
Fiona sat in the driver's seat of her car, parked right outside the gates of Northwood University.
On her phone, two identical posts appeared on her feed.
Both were selfies of Leo.
Both had the exact same caption.
【Caught a cold. Feeling awful.】
She carefully compared the two accounts. The content was identical. If it weren't for the different profile pictures and names, she would have thought she was seeing double.
But Fiona quickly noticed a pattern.
Leo Beckett's posts always appeared ten to fifteen minutes before Ryan Cole's.
Take the most recent post about being sick.
Leo had posted it five minutes earlier.
Her finger hovered between the two profiles. The image of the shy, gentle man from the coffee shop filled her mind.
Without hesitation, she switched to Leo Beckett's chat.
She sent a message:
【Leo, I'm going to have some things sent over to you. Can you give me the address for your dorm building at Northwood?】

12
When the delivery driver brought a mountain of packages to our dorm, Jake was the first to pounce.
"Whoa, Leo, is this all from your girlfriend?"
"She's not my girlfriend," I quickly corrected him. "Just... a friend I met recently..."
Jake slung an arm around my shoulder, a sly grin on his face. "Leo, last weekend, my buddy from the art department saw you getting picked up by a luxury car outside the main gate. He said the girl was gorgeous!"
"Fess up. You're secretly dating, aren't you?"
I thought of Fiona's bright eyes and gentle demeanor, and my face immediately flushed.
"We haven't made anything official yet. Don't spread rumors."
"She's already picking you up! What do you mean, not official? My friend said that car was worth at least half a million dollars!"
The mention of half a million dollars pricked Ryan's ears.
He shot me a disdainful look and snorted.
"Tch. No matter how rich she is, she can't be richer than my girlfriend."
Jake's voice was just loud enough for everyone to hear. "Ryan, we still haven't even seen your girlfriend!"
Ryan froze.
It was true. Not only had his roommates not seen her, he hadn't either.
A knot of anxiety tightened in his chest. Over the past week, Fiona had grown noticeably distant. She'd reply to maybe one out of every ten messages. Just a moment ago, he'd sent her a pitiful text:
【Fifi, I caught a cold. I feel so awful~】
That was two hours ago. The last message in their chat was still his green bubble. There was no sign of a reply.
Even someone as dense as him could tell something was wrong.
Was she mad because he'd turned her down three times?
Ryan's mood soured, and he gripped his phone tightly, his mind racing.
Just then, my phone chimed. It was Fiona.
【Leo, are you free this evening? I'd like to treat you to dinner.】
A smile played on my lips as I replied:
【Sure. Whatever you arrange, Miss Walton.】
【Then let's go to that new French restaurant, V.Chuchoter. See you there.】
The moment we confirmed the plans, an explosive message flashed across the bullet comments:
【OMG, OMG, LOOK! The male lead is finally going to meet her!】
