My half-sister was reborn. She predicted a zombie outbreak, the end of the world, in two months.
My husband and his whole family believed her. They went crazy hoarding supplies, even spending a fortune to turn their out-of-town estate into an impregnable fortress.
My husband blew through all his savings and then borrowed from loan sharks. I clutched at his leg, begging him to stop, but he just kicked me out with nothing but a signed divorce agreement.
Two months later, my husband called, scoffing, “The first infected person is about to appear. If you don’t want to die, come kneel at the mansion gates. Vivian is kind, she might just let you in.”
But on the predicted day, the apocalypse never came. That’s when they finally panicked.
