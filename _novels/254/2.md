She came with Mrs. Sterling to propose marriage to Liam. My grandfather, when he was alive, had indeed arranged a childhood engagement with Mr. Sterling. It was a casual remark made over drinks, a jest, and I never imagined Mrs. Sterling would take it seriously.

The atmosphere in the living room grew awkward. Mira, who had been silently staring at the floor, suddenly stood up and walked towards the backyard. Aunt Clara quickly told me to follow her, instructing me to look after her carefully.

At first, I didn't know she had autism. I just found it odd how rude this Miss Sterling was. It was late spring, early summer, and the roses in the garden were blooming in vibrant, delicate hues. Mira, as if by magic, pulled a canvas and easel from her backpack and began to paint with intense focus. I didn't dare disturb her, so I stood silently behind her, just watching.

It’s no exaggeration to say Mira was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. She had stunning bone structure, flawless, porcelain skin. Her eyes, deep enough to make your heart skip a beat, exuded an aristocratic aura. Just as I was silently marveling at how some people just hit the genetic lottery, something dramatic happened.

Mira seemed intensely dissatisfied with her painting. With a frustrated growl, she crumpled the canvas into a ball. I wanted to offer some comfort, but she suddenly reached out and squeezed the sharp thorns on a rose stem. Blood instantly welled up and trickled down her hand, but she didn’t seem to feel any pain. Instead, she tilted her head, looking thoughtful, as if observing something profound.

“Let go! Please, let go!” I was frantic, like a cat on a hot tin roof. Miss Sterling was a distinguished guest of the Sterling family. If she got hurt under my watch, who knew how much trouble it would cause Aunt Clara. I yelled loudly, but she didn’t react at all. Left with no choice, I reached out to grab her arm. The moment my hand touched her sleeve, she suddenly flew into a rage, shoving me hard to the ground.

I was terrified. Her expression was absolutely horrifying. I even thought she would hit me. But she didn't. She just turned back and continued painting. Mrs. Sterling, hearing the commotion, rushed over. She was clearly used to such incidents and quickly led her daughter away.

After they left, Liam burst into tears. “I don’t want to marry her! I want to go to the UK! If you dare force me, I’ll end it right here!” Aunt Clara’s heart ached, but beneath it was a profound sense of helplessness. The bulk of our family’s business relied on the Sterlings. Offending Mrs. Sterling would have unimaginable consequences. Aunt Clara tried to comfort her son while secretly glancing at me.

“The family doesn’t have just one son, why are you always looking at Liam?!” my uncle questioned.

Liam nodded furiously. “Exactly! Let Owen marry her! Mom and Dad have raised him for so many years; it can’t be for nothing.”

“What nonsense are you talking about? Miss Sterling has autism! How could I possibly push Owen into such a difficult situation?!” Aunt Clara retorted, her voice strained.

“So you’d rather your own son jump into that difficult situation…”
