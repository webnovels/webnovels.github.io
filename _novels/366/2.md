Soon, the butler brought two large black dogs. Gabriel threw the bundle in front of them.
They smelled the blood and excitedly dragged out the remaining limbs, starting to devour them.
I went mad, rushing forward to snatch Jack back, but the butler held me tightly.
I screamed at Gabriel, my heart breaking: "Gabriel Curtis, that's your son! He was killed by dogs, how can you feed him to dogs again? Are you even human?!"
Gabriel carefully shielded Lily, worried the bloody smell might frighten her.
He looked at me mockingly: "Aria Stone, you're quite the actress. You've really put a lot of thought into this scheme, but use your brain for once. Jack is learning manners at the dog training facility. He's fine."
"In a week, I'll bring him back myself. No matter how you act now, I won't give in to you."
I hated him so much my teeth bled from biting down. I fought like a wild animal against those holding me back, finally managing to grab back the remaining body parts.
The black dogs, enjoying their meal, bared their teeth at me when I took away their food.
Gabriel frowned and quickly had the dogs taken away.
He had lost all patience with me and didn't want to look at me anymore. He turned to leave with Lily.
I spat out hatefully at their backs: "My child is dead. Her child won't live either!"
Ever since Gabriel's older brother died, he had been taking care of his sister-in-law Lily, even to the point of sharing a bed.
At first, Gabriel tried to keep the affair secret, doing his best to hide it from me.
Until one day, Gabriel brought back a badly injured Lily. His eyes were cold and unfamiliar when he looked at me.
He slapped me hard: "Aria Stone, I never thought you could be so vicious. If I hadn't arrived in time, Lily would have been violated and killed. She's pregnant, for God's sake."
That was the first time Gabriel had ever hit me. I was confused, not knowing what had happened, and tried to ask using sign language.
But he no longer had the patience to wait for me to finish signing. He warned me: "Stop acting all pitiful. I won't fall for it anymore."
"If you can't accept Lily, I don't mind divorcing you and marrying her."
From then on, Gabriel and Lily's relationship was out in the open. Even his mother, Mrs. Curtis, couldn't do anything about it.
I had thought about divorcing him countless times, but I couldn't because I wouldn't get custody of Jack.
In the end, it cost Jack his life.
I held Jack's body and cried until I passed out.
When I woke up again, Gabriel was dragging me by my hair to Lily's bedside.
Lily's face was pale. She looked at me with tears in her eyes:
"Aria, I know you don't like me. You think I stole Gabriel from you. But the baby is innocent. How could you be so cruel as to exchange my baby's life for your ability to speak?"
The cursed words had come true. Her child was gone.
I smiled coldly.
Seeing my reaction, Gabriel became even more furious. He kicked me in the chest, making me cough up blood.
"You bitch! I knew there was a reason you suddenly started talking. You must have used some evil method to exchange Lily's child for your voice!"
"I've always been too soft on you, letting you forget your place. Now that Lily's lost her baby, you must pay the price!"
"You want to talk? Wait for your next life!"
Gabriel picked up a bowl of medicine and grabbed my neck, trying to force it down my throat. I tightly closed my mouth, struggling desperately.
He pried open my teeth, and just as the medicine was about to pour in, I was too exhausted to resist anymore.
If I drank this medicine, I would become truly mute.
Gabriel Curtis, how could you be so cruel!
