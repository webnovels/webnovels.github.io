When I returned to the Curtis mansion carrying my son's incomplete remains, Gabriel was in the garden, personally planting roses for Lily.
Blood-red roses, blooming lusciously.
Gabriel's eyes were tender when looking at Lily, but they turned to disgust when he saw me:
"Aria Stone, look at yourself. You look like death warmed over. Has the Curtis family gone bankrupt that we can't afford to feed you? You look like a beggar with your messy hair and dirty face."
"Don't think I'll feel sorry for you. You can't even raise a child properly, always scheming. Why can't you learn from Lily?"
Lily gave me a smug look, then said softly, "Aria must be worried about Jack. If only I had stayed away from Jack, he wouldn't have bumped into me. Aria must be blaming me. Gabriel, please bring Jack back soon."
Gabriel frowned, "Jack's been spoiled by this wretched woman. I sent him to the dog training facility to teach him manners. It's for his own good, and it's not your fault."
He turned to me and said, "Go clean yourself up. You're an eyesore."
I held Jack's body, staring at Gabriel expressionlessly.
I was born with cursed words. Everything I said seemed to come true in the worst way possible, so I stopped speaking entirely since I was old enough to understand.
I used to hate why I was cursed with such a power, but now I only hoped my words would come true quickly, punishing them for what they'd done.
My voice was hoarse from years of disuse: "Gabriel, you're right. The Curtis family is about to go bankrupt."
Gabriel was shocked to hear me speak: "Aria Stone, you can talk!"
His shock quickly turned to anger: "You're really something, aren't you? Pretending to be mute all these years to gain my sympathy! What a deep game you've been playing!"
"Why speak up now? Let me tell you, the Curtis heir will only be Lily's child. Don't even think about it. If you dare to harm her or the baby, I won't let you off easy."
He didn't spare me another glance: "Looking at you makes me sick. Throw away that filthy thing in your arms and get out of my sight."
My hands trembled as I held Jack's body. He was dead, yet his own father called him filthy.
I remembered how every night, he would look up at me with his innocent face and ask, "Mommy, if I'm a little better behaved, will Daddy read me a bedtime story?"
"On my birthday, will Daddy take me to the amusement park? He promised me before."
My heart ached terribly. My hands shook as I held Jack's body, tears streaming down my face. I choked out:
"Gabriel Curtis, this isn't filthy. This is the body of your son Jack. He's dead, just as you wanted!"
Gabriel paused, then sneered, "Aria Stone, so this is why you're not pretending to be mute anymore? You needed your voice for this performance? You'd even curse your own son. You're truly terrifying."
He snatched Jack's body from my arms, glanced at it carelessly, and said with cruel intent:
"Since you claim this mess of flesh is Jack, let's have the dogs identify it. We'll see if it's human flesh or some animal meat you've brought to act out your little drama."
