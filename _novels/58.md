Husband lied about being able to see everyone's lifespan to make up for missed opportunities with Adeline. He claimed I had sixty years left, but his idealized love from the past had only seven days. So, during those seven days, he wanted to fulfill the promises he made to her in their youth. He brought her to our home to personally care for her, and they revisited their young love, rekindling their romance. I didn't make a fuss.

He professed his love to Adeline and then organized an extravagant wedding to marry her, making me the bridesmaid. I didn't argue. Until he decided to break the ultimate barrier with her in our marital home. With guilt in his eyes, he asked me to move out of our house. The maids laughed at me, but I simply smiled and agreed. I then packed my belongings and moved into the guest room next door with my child. Seeing me as compliant as ever, my husband teared up:

"I promise, this is the last time I'll wrong you. Once Addie passes away, I'll make it up to you." He didn't know I had seen through his lies. Nor did he know that it was actually me with cancer, with only seven days left. In three days, I'll be gone.
