The next morning, I was woken again by the sounds from next door.

I lay with my eyes closed, letting tears stream down. An hour later, the frolicking next door stopped, and the sound of running water from the shower began.

Another hour passed before Blake walked in as usual, though his ears were still unusually flushed.

Blake acted as if nothing had happened and took me downstairs for breakfast.

Malicious gazes, a mix of curiosity and malice, landed on me.

"Is that her? She looks like…"

"I remember two days ago when she checked in, she was wearing that mosquito net wedding dress…"

"She looks so innocent, but behind closed doors, she's really…"

My body stiffened. The whispers in my ears magnified, growing louder and louder…

Did they all know? Had they all seen?

Seen me in that ridiculous mosquito net wedding dress, in the back of the car, in the public restroom by the highway rest area, in the Airbnb… like a broken rag doll, used and discarded?

My hands trembled violently. My fork clattered to the floor. All eyes instantly and shamelessly focused on me.

Cold sweat drenched my back. I squeezed a sentence through gritted teeth: "What… what are they saying…?"

Blake shot a warning glare at the people around us, then patted my hand reassuringly. "They're not talking about you. Don't overthink it."

How could that be?! They definitely saw it!

How much did Blake hate me?! After letting countless men humiliate me, he even uploaded the videos online?!

My pupils constricted, and a scream tore from my throat before I even realized what I was doing.

Blake looked at me, bewildered, a hint of guilt and unease flickering across his face.

My hands instinctively covered my eyes. Overwhelming panic suffocated me, making it impossible to breathe. Through my fingers, I saw Sawyer Hayes striding towards me.

Just as I thought I was about to be rescued.

Blake looked at him and snapped, his voice sharp and urgent.

His words made me plummet into hell instantly:

"I told you to come tonight! What are you doing here now!"

Sawyer Hayes was my step-brother, only three years older than me.

When I was little, my stepfather, right in front of my mom, reached into my shirt. It was Sawyer who grabbed a beer bottle, injured him, and dragged me out of that hellhole.
