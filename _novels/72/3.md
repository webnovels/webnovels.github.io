I sat in the car, rain blurring the windows.

Jasper's figure in the rain grew smaller, eventually vanishing.

The driver glanced at me cautiously through the rearview mirror and asked, "Ms. Su, where to now?"

"To the office."

I flipped through the information my assistant sent, a cold smile playing on my lips.

"And by the way, schedule a meeting with Dahlia."

At two in the morning, my office lights were still on.

On the computer screen.

Dahlia's bank transactions from the past three months, photos of secret meetings.

Even her emails with Jasper's competitors were clearly displayed.

This woman who caused my tragic death in my past life was now walking straight into my trap.

"Ms. Su, Ms. Lin has arrived."

The assistant knocked to remind me.

I closed the laptop, looking up at the door.

Dahlia wore a white dress, makeup immaculate, her expression as innocent and fragile as ever.

She bit her lip slightly, speaking timidly, "Nora, you wanted to see me?"

In my past life, this pitiful act fooled Jasper into doing her bidding.

I smiled slightly, gesturing for her to sit. "I heard you and Jasper have been getting along well?"

A flash of pride crossed her eyes, quickly masked. "Jasper... he's just been looking out for me."

"Is that so?"

I slid a document her way. "Did you know he's been investigating your fund transfers?"

Dahlia's face went pale instantly.

She shot up from her seat, the chair screeching against the floor. "What are you talking about?!"

I leisurely opened the file, pointing at the figures:

"Thirty million, transferred to overseas accounts. What do you think Jasper's reaction will be when he finds out?"

Her fingers clutched her skirt tightly, knuckles white. "You... what do you want?"

I stood, looking down at her:

"Simple."

I said softly, "Keep going."

Three days later, Jasper Corporation's stock plummeted.

Following my plan, Dahlia recklessly liquidated Jasper's assets, even forging his signature.

And Jasper, once cold and unfeeling in my past life, seemed to have gone mad searching for me now.

He blew up my phone, his car constantly parked outside the company.

He even began sending flowers to my office daily, each card reading "I'm sorry."

Too bad, it's too late.

"Ms. Su, Jasper Corporation has applied for an emergency bank loan."

The assistant reported, "But on Dahlia's end..."

"Quite straightforward."

I murmured softly, "I need you to proceed."

Three days later, the stock price of Jasper Corporation nosedived.

Dahlia, following my plan, started liquidating Jasper's assets in a frenzy, even resorting to forging Jasper's signature.

Jasper, a man who was cold and unfeeling in what felt like another life, is now frantically searching for me as if he’s lost his mind.

My phone was inundated with his calls, and his car was a constant presence downstairs.

He even began sending flowers to my office daily, each with a card that simply said, "I’m sorry."

But it’s too late now.

"Ms. Su, Jasper has already applied for an emergency loan from the bank."

My assistant reported, "But on Dahlia’s side..."

"Keep going."

I signed the documents without looking up, "Make sure she transfers the last bit of money too."

The assistant hesitated for a moment:

"But... if Jasper really goes bankrupt, the shares you previously held..."

I let out a soft, ironic chuckle, "Who cares about that small amount of money?"

What I want is for Jasper to be left with nothing.

Just as I was once left with nothing.

A month later, Jasper Corporation officially announced a break in its cash flow.

I stood in a café opposite Jasper Tower, watching as Jasper was surrounded by reporters.

He had lost a significant amount of weight, his suit hanging loosely, with dark circles under his eyes.

A reporter asked sharply:

"Mr. Gu, it’s said that this crisis is related to your fiancée, Dahlia?"

Jasper suddenly looked up, his gaze intense, "She’s not my fiancée."

"Then did you divorce Ms. Nora for Ms. Lin?"

His expression crumbled instantly.

I put down my coffee cup and turned to leave.

Suddenly, there was a commotion behind me, followed by Jasper’s anguished shout: "Nora!"

I didn’t look back.

The sky started to rain. I opened my umbrella and walked into the crowd.

In this life, I’ve finally learned to leave without looking back.
