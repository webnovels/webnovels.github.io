I gripped my phone tightly, my knuckles turning white.

"Turn around."

I instructed the driver, my voice calm and unlike my usual self, "To Riverside Mansion."

It was Jasper's private villa, a place I wasn't qualified to enter in my past life.

But this time, I needed to confirm something.

Was he reborn too?

As the car entered the villa district, rain began to pelt the windshield.

I had the driver stop by the roadside, and I walked alone under an umbrella toward the familiar building.

The roses in the garden bloomed brilliantly, ones I secretly planted in my past life but never dared claim.

The doorbell rang three times before Jasper answered.

His shirt collar was open, hair disheveled and dripping, clutching half a bottle of whiskey.

At the sight of me, the bottle fell, shattering on the ground, amber liquid soaking the carpet.

"You really came."

His voice was hoarse, eyes swirling with emotions I'd never seen. "Just like in the dream..."

Raindrops rolled off the umbrella's spokes, forming a transparent curtain between us.

I stared into his eyes. "Did you dream of my death?"

He grabbed my shoulders suddenly, the force painful:

"Not just a dream! I remember every second—you jumping in front of the bullet, blood splattering on my face..."

His voice quivered. "I remember holding Dahlia and saying... saying..."

"Saying 'finally free.'"

I calmly interjected, watching his face lose all color. "So you were reborn too."

The words seemed to flip a switch, and Jasper suddenly knelt in the rain.

Rain soaked his shirt, outlining a gaunt figure.

The ever-dominant Mr. Gu, now as pitiful as a beggar.

"Nora, I..."

"Shut up."

I stepped back, the umbrella blocking his pleading gaze.

"Jasper, did you think being reborn was your chance for redemption?"

Lightning split the sky, illuminating his pale face.

I leaned closer to his ear, whispering:

"No, it's my chance for revenge."

As I turned, he lunged, wrapping his arms around my legs:

"At least tell me, that bullet..."

"Didn't hit a vital spot."

I shook off his hands. "But you stopped the hospital from supporting my heart and lungs."

His cries were drowned by the thunder.

I walked to the waiting car in the rain, never looking back.

Just then, my phone lit up with a message from my assistant:

"Ms. Su, we found out Dahlia started transferring Jasper's funds last month."

I smirked.

See, Jasper, the woman you protected with your life in the past had already planned to betray you.

And this time, I'll personally send both of you to hell.
