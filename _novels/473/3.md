Rhys skillfully cracked open the lobster and placed the tender meat on my plate. "It's lobster alright, but it's local. The seller's wife just had a baby, he needed to rush home, so he sold it cheap."
It sounded suspiciously similar to his excuse yesterday. Yesterday, the abalone seller's son got married, so it was a day for everyone to celebrate.
The day before that, he'd helped someone catch a chicken, and the owner kindly gave him one.
These kinds of miracles seemed to happen to him every single day.
"How do you run into such good luck every day?" I was baffled, taking a bite of the lobster meat. The delicious flavor melted in my mouth. So good.
Rhys flashed his perfect white teeth at me, then smoothly popped a piece of meat he’d just pried from a crab claw into my mouth. "No choice, I'm just too charming and my luck is too good. Sellers practically chase me to feed me."
I chuckled, nodding. He wasn't wrong, but then I thought about it again and felt something was off.
"Then why don't you buy more?"
Rhys shook with laughter, reaching over to wipe a crumb from the corner of my mouth with his thumb. "My dearest wife works so hard, eat more."
I giggled sweetly, thoroughly enjoying his service.
Cute, he’s got some conscience after all.
He fed me until I was full, but he barely ate anything himself.
The fruit after dinner was plump and glistening, sweet and refreshing, not at all cloying. "Honey, what's this fruit you're giving me?"
Rhys had me lay with my head on his lap, feeding me the nameless, delicious fruit.
"I don't know, I picked it by the side of the road."
The food in my mouth instantly lost its appeal. Didn't this guy worry about poison?
"I tasted it beforehand; it's perfectly fine. Good, right?" He saw right through my thoughts.
"I'd eat it even if it was poisoned." I turned and wrapped my arms around his waist, burying my face in his eight-pack abs.
Harper was right. Rhys was a total charmer, keeping me utterly bewitched every single day.
But hey, I totally fell for it. I loved it.
I'd happily die in his arms, and I'd be a happy ghost.
This comfortable, easy life… if only I didn't have to be controlled by work, how perfect would that be?
"No more eating. I still have work to do. If I don't finish tonight, that old creep at my company will definitely make my life miserable again."
I reluctantly climbed off his lap. Ugh, life isn't easy.
"Is it that boss of yours again?" Rhys frowned, his expression instantly darkening.
"You bet. Just looking at him makes me want to puke sometimes. Honestly, I really want to quit, sigh." I patted his head. I didn't tell him about the harassment; he's a guy, I didn't want him to feel his dignity was threatened.
Rhys suddenly wrapped his arms around my waist, flipping us over so he was pinning me on the couch.
His eyes bore into mine, filled with fire and fury.
"Then just quit."
I froze for a second, then burst out laughing.
He's like a naive prince, totally out of touch with real-world struggles. Every single thing costs money!
"Come on, I'll go do some work. Just one hour, okay? One hour." I coaxed him, enjoying our little game.
But Rhys wouldn’t play along. Between soft kisses, he whispered in my ear, seducing me, "You know me, one hour is nowhere near enough…"
"Rhys, just give me a bit, okay? Just a little while." I blinked my eyes, a pleading look on my face.
"No." His kisses fell like rain, pouting like a stubborn child.
"Honey… my sweet husband…" I gasped, feeling myself melting into a puddle, practically liquid.

I tried to dodge his kisses, but he kept landing them perfectly.
"I know."
He was so shameless, and I was so flustered.
This husband, he was perfect in every way, but seriously, exhausting in the best way.
