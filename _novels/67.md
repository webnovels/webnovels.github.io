I am the only son of the nation's wealthiest family, back home to prepare to take over the family business. I never expected that simply attending a banquet with my sister would lead to being mistaken as her lover by her "boy toy," Asher. In my past life, he severed my hands and tortured me in a basement for three days and nights.

"My family's darling is of high status; how could a poor guy like you ever hope to reach that high?" Asher's sister, Adeline, knelt before my sister, Phoebe, begging her to avenge me, but she remained indifferent. "Even if he is my brother, if his death could make Asher happy, then it's worth it." To help Asher cover up his crime, she even ran over Adeline at the police station entrance when she was seeking justice for me.

When I opened my eyes again, I found myself back at the moment Asher was about to cut off my hands. This time, I decisively hung up the call to my biased sister and turned to call my mom.

"Mom, I want to revoke my sister's inheritance rights and expel her from the family. Also, help me prepare the engagement banquet with Adeline."

I want to see who ends up in the mud pit this time.
