The princess of the city's elite circle, disfigured from a car accident, was looking to marry. The old patriarch invited all the unmarried men in the city to a banquet to choose a husband.

I, married for five years, received an invitation.

When I went to the civil affairs bureau, I was told: the marriage certificate was fake.

And my wife's legal husband was her distant cousin.
