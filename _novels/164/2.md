I collapsed to the floor, biting my lip hard, unable to suppress the coldness surging in my heart.

I stayed awake until dawn, and finally, my phone lit up with a message from Adeline:

"I was too anxious last night and spoke harshly."

"Jasper, I'm sorry."

My nose tingled, and tears welled up instantly.

All these years, she was always the first to apologize after a fight, and I'd forgive her down the steps she offered.

But this time was different.

I could never get over this.

Before I could reply, she sent a photo.

It was a picture of her with the newborn.

The tiny baby was cradled in her arms, her gaze tender as spring water.

"I gave birth early, naturally, but luckily the baby is healthy."

"The baby looks a lot like Asher."

"I need to stay in the hospital for three days."

"Let's postpone the wedding for a week; I can't handle much right now."

These seemingly ordinary words, each one pierced my heart.

I numbly stood up, tearing off the wedding decorations from the wall, and took scissors to shred her wedding dress.

As I packed, my fingers trembled uncontrollably.

Just as I zipped my suitcase, Adeline's mother entered, her face unable to hide the joy.

"Adeline asked me to bring some clothes for her to the hospital. As her future grandma, I'm anxious to see my granddaughter too."

Seeing me silent, she warmly took my arm, "Jasper, Adeline was wrong to hide it from you and hurt your pride. But it's not an unforgivable thing, right?"

"Auntie knows you two have deep feelings; how can it end over such a small thing? What we said in the group chat was just in anger, let's not take it seriously."

"Come, go to the hospital with me to see the baby. Give Adeline a way out, and let's move past this."

Like a walking corpse, I let her lead me, and before I knew it, I was standing at the hospital room door.

Asher lay weakly on the bed, his pale face still streaked with tears, clearly terrified during Adeline's delivery.

Adeline was gently holding the baby, softly humming a lullaby.

Adeline's father rarely smiled, "Adeline is a flight attendant, so let's name the child Yang Jihang, to carry on the aviation career!"

"What nonsense!" Adeline's mother scolded, "How can a girl have such a name?"

Eagerly, she reached to hold the baby.

But Adeline turned away, "Mom, you don't know how to hold her, don't hurt her."

She glanced at me, her eyes lighting up, "Jasper, come look at her. Her tiny hands and feet, aren't they adorable?"

She leaned down to kiss the baby, but suddenly stopped, like a child caught doing something wrong, "No, no, Mommy can't pass germs to you."

I had never seen this side of her, clumsy yet tender as a new mother.

She was eager to show off this joy to the world, but I shouldn't be part of it.

I forced a stiff smile, turning to leave.

Adeline caught my arm, carefully presenting the baby to me, "Jasper, look, her nose and mouth, don't they look just like Asher's?"

I glanced down; the small face was indeed a spitting image of Asher, like they were carved from the same mold.

The resemblance stung my eyes, my throat suddenly tight with pain.

I coldly pushed the swaddle away, seeing Adeline's hopeful eyes, suddenly not wanting to oblige her, "Take it away, looks so annoying, it's irritating just to look at."

The baby wailed out loud.

Adeline's eyes turned cold, soothing the baby gently.

Adeline's mother's gaze cut like a knife, "You're the most annoying one!"

Adeline's father pointed to the door, "You're not welcome here, get out!"

Asher had woken up at some point.

"Jasper..." he pleaded with Adeline's family, "I want to speak to Jasper alone."

Once the room door closed, Asher wore an apologetic look, "Jasper, I don't want to break you and Adeline up; she really loves you. Actually, that night, Adeline was drunk, and we just..."

My mind buzzed, "It wasn't a sperm donation?"

He turned his face away,

"Adeline said to hide it from you, afraid you'd be hurt."

Adeline's father pointed sharply at the door. "You're not welcome here. Get out!"

Asher had woken up at some point.

"Jasper..." he implored, looking at Adeline's family, "I need to speak with Jasper alone for a moment."

Once the hospital room door closed, Asher looked apologetic. "Jasper, I don't want to come between you and Adeline. She truly cares about you. That night, Adeline was drunk, and we just..."

My mind reeled. "It wasn't about sperm donation?"

He looked away.

"Adeline wanted to keep it from you because she was afraid you'd be upset."

"By the time she found out she was pregnant, three months had already passed. She was furious and wanted to terminate the pregnancy. But my mom's health was deteriorating, and she really wanted to see me have a child. Adeline felt sorry for me and agreed to keep the baby."

"Why are you telling me this now?" I asked coldly. "Why not keep it a secret forever?"

He didn't expect me to confront him so directly. His expression changed several times before he pressed his lips together and said nothing.

I let out a bitter laugh. "Now that Adeline and I have broken up and your child is born, you three can live happily ever after. What else are you worried about?"

He suddenly glared at me, his lips curling into a strange smile.

The next moment, unexpectedly, he rolled off the hospital bed right in front of me, hitting the ground with a thud, then screamed in terror,

"Jasper, I know I was wrong, please don't hit me!"
