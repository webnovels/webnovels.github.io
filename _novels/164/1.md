That evening, Adeline walked in carefully with Asher by her side.

They had brought a box full of toys for the unborn baby.

Adeline gently touched her belly, and they shared a smile filled with the joy of impending parenthood.

Seeing me, Asher handed me a small gift box with a smile, "Jasper, I picked this especially for you. I only realized today how much this means to you. Consider it... a small apology."

Without looking, I tossed the gift box into the trash.

Asher's smile vanished, tears falling like broken pearls, "Jasper, I... I'm sorry."

He choked up and hid behind Adeline.

Adeline immediately shielded him, looking at me helplessly, "Jasper, don't be like this."

"Asher just responded to the workplace's call for quality gene donation. Plus, his mom has lung cancer and wanted a grandchild before she dies... I just wanted a child as excellent as him."

"We're just ordinary colleagues; there's really nothing between us."

"Ordinary colleagues?" My voice trembled, "Saying good morning and good night every day is ordinary? Sharing music playlists is ordinary? Covering for him at dinners and driving him home after overtime is ordinary?"

She rubbed her temples tiredly, "Here you go again. Haven't I explained all this? You're always overthinking and suspicious."

I laughed coldly.

Her explanations were flimsy, talk of normal colleague interactions and mentoring.

Full of holes, yet I chose to believe them time and again.

But five years of feelings, I couldn't just let them end like this.

Clenching my teeth, I pointed at her belly, testing her on purpose, "Fine, let's say I overthought it, I misunderstood you!"

"Abort the child, and I'll act like nothing happened. The wedding will go on."

"Impossible!" Adeline raised her voice, suppressing her anger, "The child is Asher's; I have no right to decide."

Asher's face went pale, and he suddenly knelt before me.

He tightly protected Adeline's belly with his hands, voice choked, "Jasper, there's really nothing between me and Adeline. The baby is already eight months old, kicking my hand in her belly. I can't, I can't..."

He cried his heart out, shaking all over.

Adeline's face tensed, struggling for a few seconds before softening.

She helped him up, showing a helpless smile:

"Jasper, asking me to abort the child now is no different from cutting out his heart."

I stared at her, a cold smile on my lips, "What, feeling pity now?"

Adeline was visibly stunned, then showed a pained expression, "I didn't expect you to be so heartless. If that's the condition for marriage, then we're really not the same kind of people... Let's break up."

"Jasper, Adeline is innocent. Don't take it out on her!" Asher suddenly cried out, "If you want to blame someone, blame me. I can't bear to lose the child... But I'll prove our innocence with my life!"

Before I could react, he rushed toward the balcony, acting like he was about to jump.

My heart leapt to my throat, and I instinctively moved to stop him.

But Adeline was quicker, rushing over in a panic.

Before we could get close, Asher collapsed on the floor, crying uncontrollably.

Adeline pulled him into her arms, shaking all over.

After a while, she raised her head, her eyes cold as she looked at me still standing there, "Jasper! Your baseless accusations almost killed Asher!"

Her gaze was cold, like she was looking at a stranger.

"Asher's mom is dying! Do you want to drive him to death too? You can be indifferent, but I can't." Her voice trembled.

She helped Asher up gently, facing me with a stern voice, "Move!"

I stood frozen, trying to speak, "I didn't mean..."

"Asher, the baby... seems to be coming." Adeline suddenly let out a weak moan and then fainted.

"Adeline!"

Asher's face turned ghostly pale, shoving me aside to carry Adeline out the door.
