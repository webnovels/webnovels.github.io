On the day of Ethan's engagement to my sister, I sat in the front row of the audience.

When he saw me, he inexplicably let out a sigh of relief.

"Olivia, have you finally had enough? If you apologize to me, I'll..."

All the guests were terrified, not knowing who he was talking to.

Because I was already dead.

Today was the seventh day after my death.
