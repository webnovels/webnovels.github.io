In the twenty-third year since I was adopted by the Lewis family, everyone assumed I would marry Adam Lewis.
But he thought I was beautiful yet brainless, far inferior to the intelligent beauty he met in college.
I knew he probably didn't love me, so when he went abroad as an exchange student with his smart female classmate, I agreed to an arranged marriage with the Chen family.
After I got engaged to the eldest son of the Chen family, Adam returned.
When he saw me with my fiancé, he went crazy.
"Melody, didn't you promise you'd only be with me? How could you break your word?"
