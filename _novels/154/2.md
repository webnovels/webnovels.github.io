I put on the scant dress Nora picked for me. She pushed me into the private room, where a pot-bellied, half-drunk man greeted me.

His alcoholic breath hit my face, making my stomach churn.

"Miss Song, if you're late, you must drink three glasses as punishment!"

"Mr. Knox, my sister can handle her liquor, I'll have her drink double for you!"

Nora complimented the man with a smile, her fingertips pinching into the soft flesh of my arm, threatening in a low voice, "Vera, you better perform well, or you know what will happen!"

I looked down at the full row of white liquor before me, my already pale face turning even worse. But I had no choice but to take the glass, downing one after another.

My stomach burned painfully, and black spots danced in my vision. Suddenly, Nora accidentally knocked over a champagne bottle, jolting me awake.

The entire bottle poured down my chest, turning my dress transparent, revealing what lay beneath. I had no mind to catch the fleeting malice in Nora's eyes.

I turned to leave the room, but Mr. Knox grabbed my wrist. "Don't go. Stay with me tonight, and I'll guarantee the lead role for Nora."

The man's leering gaze swept over me, making me shiver. But the next moment, the door was kicked open.

Gideon, emanating a terrifying chill, grabbed a bottle from the table and smashed it over Mr. Knox's head. Holding his bleeding forehead, Mr. Knox looked up in disbelief, "Young Master Jiang, what is the meaning of this?!"

"Did I let you speak?!" Gideon kicked him again, and Mr. Knox fell to the ground, crying out in pain. Gideon stared at my half-exposed shoulder, his voice cold as ice, "Why are you still standing there? Go change your clothes!"

I clutched my soaked dress, stunned, unmoving. "Gideon, isn't this what you wanted to see? Why are you here?" A strange look flashed in Gideon's dark eyes, quickly turning to hatred, "What do you think? You think I care about you? I'm just afraid you'll use any means to seduce someone else and run away."

Gideon's voice was low, full of mockery. I found it hard to breathe.

"Vera, are you really going to stand there, dressed like that, in front of me?" I snapped back to reality, fleeing the room.

Back at the old house, I finally scrubbed off the sticky feeling.

Wrapped in a bathrobe, I went to the balcony for some air, only to hear a faint noise behind me. Realizing something was wrong, I turned to pull the balcony door.

Sure enough, it wouldn't budge.

A few minutes later, I stopped banging on the glass, a bitter laugh escaping my lips. The same old trick, I've fallen for it countless times, yet I never learn.

As expected, I developed a high fever by morning.

My forehead was burning, yet my limbs were cold and trembling. I didn't know when the door opened. Gideon stood over me, looking down in disdain, "Vera, what trick are you pulling now? Since you're awake, get ready. Nora has a scene in ice water today, and you're shooting it for her."
