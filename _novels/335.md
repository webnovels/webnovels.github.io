"I was being tortured, but my dad, the hotshot detective, and my mom, the top medical examiner, were at my little brother Ethan's tennis tournament.
The guy doing this to me, someone my dad had put away, wanted revenge. He cut out my tongue, then called my dad from my phone. My dad just said, ""Whatever it is, Ethan's match is more important right now!"" and hung up.
The guy laughed. ""Guess I kidnapped the wrong kid. Thought they'd care more about their golden boy.""
When they arrived at the crime scene, my parents were shocked. They were furious at how brutal the killer had been.
They just didn't realize the mangled mess was their own son."
