I know my birth was a mistake.

My mother stood in for a wealthy heiress. After not finding love, she orchestrated my conception and was sent to a mental hospital.

Before she passed away, she held my hand and said, "Don't be like me, Adeline. You need to live a life more brilliant than mine."

Later, as I huddled in the corner clutching expired bread, four men stormed in with eyes burning red.

My financier father handed me a platinum card. "Five million a month as an allowance, but don't expect me to call you daughter."

Three brothers blocked the door, sneering, "With your tainted blood, you think you're fit to be part of the Thompson family?"

I turned my life around, entered a talent show, and shot to fame, starring in films that grossed ten billion.

During a live stream, my childhood friend declared, "Adeline deserves the best love in the world."

On a stormy day, the four men knelt outside the villa, pleading, "Adeline, come home, please look at us."
