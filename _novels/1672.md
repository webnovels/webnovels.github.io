I dropped by the company Chloe Miller runs for a surprise audit.

The second I walked in, I spotted a newly built room. It was kitted out with high-end computers and audio equipment. Inside, a stylishly dressed guy was completely zoned into a game, the volume cranked so loud it made the office walls vibrate.

A few minutes later, he lost the game. Pissed, he slammed his keyboard, stormed out, and pointed at the employees outside.

"Can't you guys type more quietly?! If you hadn't been so loud, I wouldn't have lost!"

I pulled the intern next to me aside and asked who'd hired this clown.

The intern whispered, "He's CEO Miller's husband, Jake. I heard that he owns the whole company."

My temples started throbbing.

He's Chloe's husband? Then what the hell am I?

I pulled out my phone and called my dad.

"Dad, tell Chloe to bring the divorce papers to the office. Now."


Dad sent me to the company to test Chloe.

He said it was just a routine check—nothing to stress over, just a chance for me to get acquainted with the business.

I figured it'd be just a formality.

I told the receptionist I was an auditor from Corporate, and she swiped me through security without a hitch.

The second I stepped into the office floor, a deafening wall of game noise hit me.

At the far end of the space was a new glass-walled room packed with top-of-the-line computer gear—a massive monitor, mechanical keyboard, high-end mouse, and a full surround sound setup.

A silver-haired kid in a trendy hoodie was glued to the screen, headphones on, furiously smashing buttons.

"C'mon! You guys suck! Can't you play any better?!"

He muttered curses under his breath, fingers flying across the keyboard, totally zoned into his gaming bubble.

Outside, the employees all looked miserable. A few had noise-canceling headphones on, heads down in their work.

Not five minutes later, a furious yell erupted from the glass room.

The guy ripped off his headphones, slammed them on the desk, then smash his keyboard before yanking open the glass door and storming out.

He pointed at the programmers crunching to meet deadlines and started yelling.

"Can't you guys type quieter?! Tap, tap, tap! It's so freaking annoying!"

"I lost that last team fight 'cause you jerks were too loud! A bunch of losers—can't you work quietly?"

The programmer he was yelling at froze, face flushing red then paling, hand trembling on the mouse.

"Clearly, you're just trash at the game…" mumbled a female colleague next to him.

"What'd you say?" Jake's ears pricked up. He whirled on her. "Say that again—I dare you."

The woman flinched, shrinking back in her chair, too scared to peep.

I watched the scene go down, my blood starting to boil.

I flagged down a young-looking intern nearby.

"Who's this clown?"

The intern glanced at me, then quickly at Jake's retreating back, eyes wide with nervousness.

He put his finger to his lips, signaling me to keep it down.

"Shhh."

He leaned in close, voice scarcely audible.

"He's Chloe Miller's husband, Jake—our GM."

My heart dropped. All of Chloe's weird behavior lately suddenly clicked.

The intern kept going.

"Word is he owns the whole company—so he's the real boss around here."

"You new here? You'll get used to it after a few days."

He sighed, looking way more worn-out than his age.

"Chloe even built that room just for him to game. He usually holes up in there, so we don't deal with him much."

"He must've lost a bunch of games today—so he's in a crappy mood and came out to vent."

His words bounced around my head, mind spinning.

He's Chloe's husband.

Then what the hell am I? 

The intern caught my expression and frowned worriedly.

"You good? You look awful."

I shook my head, forcing a smile.

"I'm fine—just a little shocked."

"Having someone like that in a company… it's definitely an eye-opener."

The intern shrugged dryly.

"You'll get used to it. He never actually does anything. We just grin and bear it, hoping he'll win a game soon so he'll go back to his cave."

I didn't say anything else.

Never actually does anything?

Publicly humiliating employees, ruining the whole office vibe—that's not "doing" anything?

I watched Jake grumble back to the glass room, slap his headphones on, and the game noise cranked back up.

I pulled out my phone, half-tempted to call my dad right then.

But I paused, then put it away.

Walking out now would let Chloe off way too easy.

Dad sent me here to evaluate her skills.

And right now, both her skills and her character had massive red flags.

I wanted to see just how badly this company had gone off the rails under her watch.

I smoothed out my shirt and headed to the front desk.

"Hi, I'm Liam Miller, assigned by Corporate to do a project review."

"Can you set me up with a temporary workstation? Somewhere quiet, preferably."

"Also, this is an internal audit—I'd rather Chloe doesn't know I'm here."

The receptionist nodded politely.

I walked into the office floor, found a corner spot, and my eyes landed on the glass room.

Jake was already back to gaming, flailing his arms around, totally clueless about the new person in the office.
