The company's annual gala was a blur of shimmering dresses and forced smiles. Then, Chloe, the new intern, publicly accused me of deliberately tripping her and staining her designer gown.

My husband, Liam, didn't hesitate. He told me to hand over the dress I'd picked out for our anniversary to compensate her.

When I refused, she flew into a rage, humiliating me in front of everyone:

"You're nothing but a discarded toy, auctioned off and shamed by your ex-fiancé! How dare you even think of marrying Liam?!"

With that, she threw a glass of red wine over my head.

"I heard your compromising photos were auctioned off for a dollar! There are so many people here today, why don't you show off your wet body to everyone?"

A collective gasp swept through the room.

My heart clenched, and I stared at my husband in shock.

My mind raced back. I'd been drugged and tricked into a sham marriage by my ex-fiancé, and my intimate photos were livestreamed for auction. Luckily, my childhood friend, Liam, came to my rescue, buying off all those photos at an astronomical price.

But now, I realized the salvation I thought I'd found was just a casual joke to him.

If that's the case, I choose to leave.
