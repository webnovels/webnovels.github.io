At the product launch event, my stepson pulled off my dress in front of everyone.

hat day, the trending topics were filled with photos of me trying desperately to cover myself.

He smugly held up his phone: "Just a stand-in, and you think you can have both a family and a career?"

"Since you're using my mom's eyes, you should stay home and be a servant!"

The cruel comments online were hard to read, but nothing hurt more than the cold, hateful look from Asher Thompson.

Twenty years ago, I had no choice when I was abducted. Twelve years ago, when my biological parents found me, I had no choice.

Eight years ago, I had no choice when I was married off as a stand-in for my foster sister to Declan Thompson. But now, I want to make my own choice.

I won't continue down this path with you.
