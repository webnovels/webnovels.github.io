At the engagement party, my assistant asked if I wanted to kick them out.

I shook my head. Forget it, the stars of this engagement party aren't them anyway.

Let's just treat them as a few extra guests.

But as soon as they entered, the other CEOs around eagerly went over to toast them.

"Young Mr. Grant is so accomplished, acquiring American Vikey at such a young age."

That was actually me negotiating the acquisition as the Sinclair heiress. He just went to sign his name.

"I heard Mr. Lawrence has had success in racing. It would be quite a story if he inherits the Sinclair family in the future."

If it weren't for the Sinclair family's funding, his racing club would have gone bankrupt long ago.

"Mr. Johnson's paintings have fetched sky-high prices in art circles. The Sinclair bloodline must be full of artistic talent!"

I was the one who bought his third-rate paintings, otherwise they would have been a laughingstock at auctions.

The guests fawned over those men endlessly.

They assumed my fiancé would definitely be chosen from among Ethan, Oliver and Zach.

Flattering them was the same as flattering the Sinclair family.

But they didn't realize at all that I was the one with inheritance rights.

Whoever I choose will be the next co-heir of the Sinclair family!

The main event of the party hadn't started yet. I was tired of watching these people bootlick and was about to step away for a moment.

But then Ethan suddenly received a phone call and shouted in disbelief:

"What?! Ivy was deliberately kidnapped?!"

As soon as he said this, I immediately felt dozens of gazes shoot towards me.

I turned my head, only to be slapped across the face by Oliver Lawrence who had walked over.

"You're truly vicious! Insulting Ivy wasn't enough, you even had someone deliberately kidnap her today!"

The banquet hall immediately burst into hushed whispers.

They all thought I was from a small town - stupid, vicious, with evil thoughts.

So they were also more willing to flatter my fiancé candidates, even disdaining to interact with me.

I held my face and coldly looked at him: "Do you have any evidence that I'm behind the kidnapping?"

Zach Johnson stood beside him with his arms crossed, sweeping a contemptuous glance at me:

"Do we need any evidence? Anyone with eyes can see what's going on."

Just then, the doors of the banquet hall were thrown open -

"Ethan, save me! Ivy is so scared!"

Ivy Chen ran in looking disheveled, her hair a mess, as if she had suffered some unspeakable abuse and humiliation.

She threw herself straight into Ethan's arms, ignoring all decorum.

Ethan immediately took off his jacket to cover her, comforting her not to be afraid.

"Given what's happened, what do you have to say for yourself? Ivy almost lost her virtue. This isn't over between us!"

Ethan glared at me angrily, directly carrying Ivy away.

Oliver Lawrence violently pushed over the champagne tower next to him. Before leaving, he pointed at me and said:

"Without us, let's see how you manage to pull off this engagement party!"

Zach Johnson also looked at me with disdain: "You reap what you sow. Don't blame us for not giving you face anymore."

The surrounding guests pointed and whispered between Ivy and me.

Saying what a lovely Sinclair princess Ivy used to be, yet now she's been tortured to this state by me, this vicious true heiress.

As Ethan and the others left, many people looked at me mockingly through their noses.

"Well now, who would still be willing to marry this wild woman?"

"Looks like the Sinclair family is finished this time."

"All the fiancés ran off. Let's see how she holds this engagement party now."

I collected myself and had people clean up the scene and reassure the guests. I announced to everyone present:

"The engagement party of Aria Sinclair officially begins!"

On the big screen, the handsome face of a young man suddenly appeared.

The guests whispered, wondering which family's young master this was.

I said: "This is Liam Kennedy, who grew up with me in that small town."

As soon as I finished speaking, the whole hall burst into laughter.

"The Sinclair family actually wants to find a small-town person as their co-heir, hahaha!"

A second after he finished speaking, on the big screen, an electronic invitation unique to New York's Kennedy family slowly unfolded.

The stern yet kindly voice of Old Mr. Kennedy rang out:

"Thank you all for attending the engagement party of Sinclair heiress Aria Sinclair and my sole grandson, Liam Kennedy!"
