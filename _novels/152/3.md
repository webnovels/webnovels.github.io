Alifilos means "wings of the clouds" in Latin.

When Father found me, he had joyfully commissioned this luxurious wedding dress for me in Switzerland.

It also symbolized my position as the heir of the Sinclair family.

But now they're saying this meaningful, once-in-a-century wedding dress was tried on by Ivy Chen first.

I looked at Ethan. He was in charge of having the wedding dress flown back from Switzerland.

Ethan looked a bit guilty under my gaze, but quickly straightened up and said to me:

"Can't you be less petty? Ivy was raised in luxury, but as soon as you came she was labeled as the fake heiress. She's been mocked and insulted by you so many times. What's wrong with lending her the dress to try on and satisfy her love of beauty?"

He sighed, closing his eyes as if making a painful decision:

"Fine, I'll agree to the engagement party! I'll let you have your wish of wearing that dress and getting engaged to me. Satisfied now?"

Hearing him say this, Oliver Lawrence and Zach Johnson complained on his behalf:

"No way, that's exactly what that evil Aria wants! Why give in to her?"

"Now Aria's going to be smug about getting her way. What a shame, sigh."

Even Ivy Chen leaned into Ethan's arms, tenderly caressing his face:

"Ethan, you don't need to make such a big sacrifice for me..."

I stood watching them, my heart bitter. I was also a young girl longing for love, yet they despised me to this extent.

I held back my tears and said to Ethan:

"Don't worry, I will never marry you."

Hearing this, Ethan looked at me as if he saw through me: "What trick are you trying to play now?"

Oliver Lawrence and Zach Johnson beside him looked at me warily, as if afraid I would reject Ethan and choose one of them instead.

At this moment, Ivy Chen suddenly crawled over and kowtowed to me:

"I'm begging you, sister. Stop torturing these three men. You've already taken away my inheritance rights and my father. Do you have to drive away the few friends I have left?!"

She kowtowed forcefully, making her already bloodied forehead even more battered. Ethan and the others were frightened and quickly went to hold her.

The group of them huddled together glaring at me, pushing me to the opposing side.

I held back the tears of grievance about to fall and turned to leave. But Ethan grabbed my hand:

"I said I'm willing to marry you. You'd better not think about hurting Oliver and the others!"

"You say you won't marry me, but do you really have the guts to reject me at the engagement party? The fact is, besides me, who else would want a small-town girl like you!"

I slowly pried his hand off mine and looked at him:

"I, Aria Sinclair, always do what I say. No need for Mr. Grant to worry."

I strode forward, still able to hear Ethan's voice behind me trying to persuade me not to throw a tantrum.

He spoke with exasperation and loudly, as if I had exhausted him.

I didn't see them again until the engagement party.

When the party started, I was surprised to see Ethan appear with a cold expression.

How strange, I clearly didn't invite them,

Yet somehow these people all showed up uninvited to my engagement party.
