But even though they looked down on me, they still lived in the villa Father gave me.

In the end, they couldn't let go of the benefits of this marriage alliance.

I looked at them and said: "If you think marrying me is embarrassing, you three can get out of my villa right now. Or -"

I glanced at Ivy Chen beside me: "You can choose to marry Ivy, who has no inheritance rights."

Hearing the words "no inheritance rights", the people in front of me immediately moved to protect Ivy.

Ethan was especially angry: "Don't think you can bully Ivy just because you have power now. Was it her choice to be switched as a baby?"

The usually hot-tempered Oliver Lawrence directed all his anger at me:

"You think we want to marry you? It's all your Sinclair family using your power to force us!"

Zach Johnson also snorted arrogantly, looking at me sideways: "Shameless. You think you can do anything just because you got some power!"

They despise power, but in reality, they are the ones who most desperately want to obtain it.

Ivy Chen started crying pitifully behind them, suddenly kneeling down to me:

"Sister, please don't be angry anymore. It's all my fault. I should have just died back then!"

With that, she suddenly rushed to bang her head against a marble pillar in the living room. Blood immediately flowed down.

Ethan and the other two quickly ran to hold her back, hugging Ivy Chen with concern.

Ivy Chen leaned weakly in Ethan's arms and looked at me:

"Sister, are you happy now? If it weren't for me, Ethan and the others wouldn't dislike you. You've always thought it would be better if I just died, right?!"

I was utterly speechless.

She had started putting on an act all by herself.

Since returning to the Sinclair family and being confirmed as the true heir, I've been studying with private tutors.

Recently I've also been going to the company early and returning late to learn the business. Where would I have time to be jealous of her?

I had glanced at her business proposal this morning too - it was childishly simple stuff that I couldn't even be bothered to comment on.

But she had used all of this to her advantage.

Hearing this, Ethan looked at me with disappointment:

"How can you still not change your small-town bad habits? Lazy, jealous, telling Ivy to die - aren't you afraid of karmic retribution?"

But I've been standing here the whole time, not doing anything at all...

Ethan continued lecturing me: "Quickly kneel down and kowtow to apologize to Ivy. Otherwise, don't blame me for breaking off the engagement!"

When I first arrived, I had fallen for Ethan who was kind to me then, and confessed to him.

But later, with Ivy's repeated crying and accusations, he became convinced that I was just a stupid and vicious small-town woman.

Since then, he has used my love as leverage, forcing me to apologize to Ivy again and again.

Kneeling, kowtowing, admitting my faults - I was young then, and thought this would keep his affection.

But he only used this love to manipulate me for five whole years.

Now that I see through everything, his love has become as cheap as air to me.

This time I just gave him an indifferent look:

"She banged her own head. I didn't force her to do it. Let her apologize to herself in the mirror."

It was the first time Ethan saw me refuse to give in, and he felt like he lost face.

He angrily pointed at me: "You dare to talk back? Small-town people really are vicious!"

Oliver Lawrence suddenly snapped his fingers and said:

"You must have found out we let Ivy try on your Alifilos wedding dress, and are deliberately torturing her, right?"

Zach Johnson also frowned: "Small-town people are so petty, not understanding the beauty of sharing."

Hearing this, my expression turned cold: "My wedding dress?"
