The day before the wedding, my father asked me:

"Have you decided on your fiancé for tomorrow?"

I nodded, "I'll choose Liam Kennedy."

Father was very surprised: "That boy who grew up with you in the small town? No, that's not a suitable match!"

I whispered a few words to Father, and he exclaimed in shock: "Really?!"

I nodded.

Liam Kennedy and I were both actually the true heirs mistakenly raised in that small town.

He was brought back to the Kennedy family last week and is their sole grandson.

He's guaranteed to be the next leader of the Kennedy family.

Father patted my shoulder: "It's an honor to be able to form a marriage alliance with the prestigious Kennedy family of New York. But weren't you always fond of that Grant boy?"

I calmly replied: "For the benefit of our family, an alliance with the Kennedys is the best outcome I've considered."

I didn't want to tell him how Ethan had scorned my small-town origins and hurt me in every interaction after that.

If I did, Father would surely confront him, which would also cause trouble with the Grant family behind him.

We still have business dealings with them, and I don't want the two families to become enemies.

Now that I have a better solution, it's about letting him go, and also freeing myself.

After Father and I finalized the marriage plans, he left my villa. Ethan and Ivy Chen hurried over to see him off.

After he left, Ethan frowned at me: "You were pestering your father about rushing our marriage again, weren't you?"

I was too tired to argue. But Ethan grabbed my arm:

"As expected of someone from a small town - poor and vulgar. All you know how to do is marry a rich man!"

Ivy Chen chimed in at this moment: "Don't worry, sister. In our big city, women are no longer mocked for not being able to marry. But you lack ambition - I sent you that business proposal yesterday and you didn't even look at it."

She had sent me a document at 4 AM last night, of course I didn't have time for her games.

But hearing Ivy say this, Oliver Lawrence and Zach Johnson also came over to mock me.

"As expected of a woman raised in poverty - even becoming the true heiress hasn't changed anything."

I was brought back to the Sinclair family from that small town. Father was overjoyed and let me choose from several young men who were already interested in marrying into our family.

The Grant, Lawrence and Johnson families weren't considered top-tier, so marrying into the Sinclair family for resources was a step up for them.

But as soon as they found out the marriage candidate was me, this small-town true heiress, their attitudes immediately changed.

They looked at me mockingly, waiting for my reaction.

I didn't say anything.

Foolish people never realize their own foolishness.

It seems they still don't understand the rules -

I'm the one representing the Sinclair family in choosing them. They were never in a position to look down on me.
