Chloe's heels clicked against the tile floor of Julian's apartment building. Her heart raced with excitement as she clutched the small blue box containing the silver watch she'd spent weeks saving for. It was their one-year anniversary, and she couldn't wait to surprise him.
"He's going to love this," she whispered to herself, fishing out the spare key he'd given her three months ago.
She remembered the day he'd given it to her. They'd been having breakfast at their favorite café.
"Move in with me," he'd said.
"That's a big step."
"Then start with this." He'd slid the key across the table. "For now."
The memory made her current situation even more bitter. The key slid into the lock smoothly. Chloe turned it, pushed open the door, and froze. The sound that escaped her throat was barely audible.
There, on Julian's leather couch, sat her boyfriend of twelve months, locked in a passionate embrace with their neighbor, Ava Martinez. Julian's hands were tangled in Ava's long dark hair, their bodies pressed together in a way that made Chloe's stomach turn.
The watch box slipped from her fingers. It hit the hardwood floor with a loud thud.
Julian broke away from the kiss, his eyes widening as they met Chloe's. "Shit."
"Don't stop on my account," Chloe said, her voice trembling.
Ava turned, her red lipstick smeared across her mouth. She didn't even have the decency to look embarrassed. Instead, she smiled – actually smiled – at Chloe.
"Oh," Ava said, running a finger across Julian's chest. "I guess the secret's out."
"Get your hands off him." Chloe's words came out as a whisper.
"Honey, he's not yours anymore," Ava purred.
Chloe's vision blurred. She blinked rapidly, refusing to let them see her cry. "How long?" 
Julian stood up, straightening his rumpled shirt. "Chloe, I—"
"How. Long."
"Two months," Ava answered, stretching like a satisfied cat. "But who's counting?"
"Six dates," Chloe said.
"What?" Julian frowned.
"In two months, you cancelled six dates with me."
"I can explain—"
"Were you with her?"
Julian's silence was answer enough.
"The weekend in Key West?" Chloe pressed.
"I had food poisoning," he stammered.
Ava laughed. "We were in Orlando."
The room started to spin. All those late nights at work. All those missed calls. The sudden cancellations. It all made sense now.
"Chloe, wait," Julian said, taking a step toward her. "Let me explain."
She held up her hand. "Don't."
"Baby, please—"
"Don't call me that." Her voice was steel, even as her insides felt like shattered glass. "Don't ever call me that again."
"It just happened," he tried.
"Things don't just happen for two months, Julian."
"I never meant to hurt you."
"Funny way of showing it."
Ava stood up, adjusting her skirt. "Should I give you two a moment?"
"No," Chloe said. "Stay. You're perfect for each other."
"What's that supposed to mean?" Ava snapped.
"Two liars in love. Beautiful symmetry."
Julian reached for her arm. "You're being dramatic."
"Don't touch me." Chloe jerked away. "Ever again."
She turned on her heel, her movements measured and calm despite the earthquake happening in her chest. She heard Julian call her name again, but he made no move to follow her. Of course he didn't. He was already back on the couch with Ava, their giggles echoing down the hallway as Chloe walked away.
The elevator doors closed behind her, and only then did she allow herself to break. She pressed her forehead against the cool metal wall, her shoulders shaking with silent sobs.
"Keep it together," she whispered to herself. "Just a few more minutes."
The watch she'd saved for lay forgotten on Julian's floor, along with her heart and every promise he'd ever made her.
In the parking lot, Chloe sat in her car, gripping the steering wheel until her knuckles turned white. Her phone buzzed – a text from Julian.
"I'm sorry you had to find out this way."
A second buzz. "Can we talk?"
A third. "It's not what you think."
She stared at the messages, a hollow laugh escaping her throat. Sorry she had to find out this way? Not sorry for betraying her trust? Not sorry for throwing away a year of love and memories?
With trembling fingers, she typed out a response: "Go to hell."
Then she blocked his number, started her car, and drove away from the apartment building where she'd just lost everything. But Chloe Martinez wasn't going to let Julian see her fall apart. No, she would save her tears for when she was alone, when there was no one around to witness how thoroughly he had broken her.
At a red light, Chloe caught her reflection in the rearview mirror. Her mascara had run, leaving dark trails down her cheeks.
"Look at you," she told her reflection. "Crying over a man who doesn't deserve your tears."
She wiped the black streaks away with the back of her hand.
"You're better than this," she continued. "You're better than them."
Her phone buzzed again – Ava, this time.
"He was never really yours."
Chloe threw her phone into the passenger seat. The light turned green, and she pressed the accelerator. She didn't know where she was going, but she knew one thing for certain: Julian Walker was going to regret the day he decided to throw away the best thing that had ever happened to him.
Behind her, the sun was setting over Miami, painting the sky in shades of red and orange. It looked like fire, like the world was burning. And maybe it was. Maybe this was the end of everything she'd known and the beginning of something else entirely.
"New chapter," she whispered to herself. "New life."
Either way, Chloe wasn't going to look back. She couldn't. Because if she did, she might drive right back to that apartment and tell Julian she forgave him. And that was one thing she promised herself she would never do.
Not this time.
Not ever again.
Some promises were meant to be kept.
