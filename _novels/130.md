Three months before the SATs, my mom took my sister and me to buy lucky charms.

Emma immediately fell in love with a black cat charm said to bring good fortune.

I chose a white cat charm that was supposed to help distinguish right from wrong.

Emma, who had always been a poor student, suddenly saw her grades skyrocket.

Meanwhile, my grades, which had always been excellent, began to plummet. I ultimately failed to get into any good colleges.

Unwilling to accept defeat, I decided to take a gap year and retake the SATs. But the stress and endless nights of studying eventually took their toll. I died from exhaustion.

In my final moments, Emma whispered in my ear:

"You know, sis, the black cat doesn't just bring good luck. It can also steal luck from others."

I died filled with resentment. But when I opened my eyes again, I found myself back on the day we chose our lucky charms.
