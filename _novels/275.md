The year my mom was critically ill and we desperately needed money, I resorted to a desperate measure to get close to Liam, finding myself in his bed.

After that wild night, I got what I wanted: I became Mrs. Hemsworth.

"I know you were in a difficult situation."

After we married, he didn't criticize me. Instead, he treated me with distant politeness.

Until I discovered his assistant, Chloe, secretly embezzling company funds.

I called the police on the spot, and for the first time, the usually composed Liam blew up at me.

"Chloe just temporarily borrowed the money for her father's treatment. I gave her my silent consent."

"Did you expect her to stoop so low as to use her body for money, like you did?"

I froze, stunned by his words.

"Can you believe Mrs. Hemsworth, who seems so proper, actually used tricks to get where she is?"

"Using her body for money? Who is *she* to give Chloe a hard time?"

Gossip filled my ears, and I pressed my lips together.

After my mother passed, I proposed divorce and repaid the money I'd borrowed from the Hemsworth family. But Liam fought tooth and nail to save the marriage.

Now, it seemed, it should have ended long ago.
