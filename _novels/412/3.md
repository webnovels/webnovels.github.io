The school's watchdogs had already called out the school leaders.

The smug-looking principal glared fiercely at Sam: "We let you attend our school as a favor to Mr. George."

"Colluding with outsiders to beat up young master Nick."

"Who can prove that Nick tore up your acceptance letter?"

"You clearly tore it up yourself and framed Nick."

"Fighting at the school gate is a serious offense."

"Not only are you not going to college this year, but your school record is now expelled, and you can't even get your files back."

"No one will take you for a retake!"

"If you still want to study, kneel down and lick the mud off young master Nick's shoes."

"Maybe I'll consider your sincere apology and give you a chance to retake the exam next year."

Claire, seeing that George's bodyguards had surrounded me, shrieked: "You little bastard, didn't you hear? Kneel down and apologize!"

"Don't forget that I still have your household registration and ID card."

"If you keep being stubborn like your dead father, I'll make sure you can't even find a job to support yourself."

What kind of abuse has my son endured all these years while I was fighting for my life out there?

This principal deserves to die!

I stepped forward, grabbed the principal's shirt collar, and kicked the back of his knees.

Forcing him to kneel in front of Sam.

"You say Sam tore up his own acceptance letter?"

"Dare you say that again?"

"Want to bet if I can tear you up more thoroughly than that acceptance letter?"

The principal, sweating profusely in pain, struggled and shouted: "Call the police! Shoot this criminal!"

I gripped the principal's throat: "Your time is running out. Think quickly about what you need to do for me to spare your miserable life!"

Claire, holding her phone, incoherently called the police.

My phone also received a message that my personal file had been declassified.

Immediate arrangements were being made for my personal security detail.

I was notified to return to headquarters to discuss arrangements for my life back in the country and settle my benefits.

Right now, I just wanted to get revenge for my son.

Who has time to care about benefits?

Claire smiled smugly: "Everyone's watching. He's assaulting people for no reason. You're all witnesses."

"Surround him well and don't let him escape. They'll be here to arrest him soon!"

"We're all civilized people. We didn't hit anyone first!"

I was certain Claire had recognized me.

She knew that among those present, no one could beat me in a fight.

Even if all the bodyguards attacked together, they might not gain the upper hand.

This looked like she was trying to frame me with a crime to get me locked up, and maybe even have me killed inside through some backroom deal.

I always felt this woman couldn't be trusted, which is why I had left money for George too, hoping he could keep an eye on her.

I never expected these two scumbags would hit it off and get together.

Realizing I had lifted a rock only to drop it on my own feet, I clenched my fists in anger.

The private high school principal struggled desperately, screaming for help.

George's bodyguards had clearly received orders.

They just surrounded me without making a move.

Seemingly waiting to see the show of me strangling the principal to death.

Preferably for me to be shot dead on the spot.

Unfortunately for them, they were going to be disappointed today.

I tightened my grip on the principal's throat.

The principal's face turned purple as he began to beg: "Please spare me, sir. Mrs. Claire has already called the police. You should run quickly."

Sam tugged at my sleeve, whispering: "Dad, revenge is a dish best served cold."

I snorted lightly: "Today, if he doesn't lick your shoes clean, I'll strangle him to death."

The principal began to reason with me: "Taking me hostage won't help. You'll be shot by snipers. They're all professionals."

"Your best bet now is to let me go and run for it."

I increased the pressure on my hand: "Don't worry. Even if I strangle a piece of trash like you with my bare hands, the snipers can't do anything to me. I'm not a rookie either."

I raised my voice to threaten the principal: "Have you figured out how to save your life yet?"

Piercing sirens rang out as several cars arrived.

The principal croaked hoarsely, shouting with all his might: "You're finished! With so many people here, you're going to eat bullets. Mr. George won't let you off!"

I tightened my grip again.

How could I bear to strangle him outright?

He had abused my son so much; letting him die like this would be too easy.

Claire immediately started screaming: "Help! Murder! The principal is about to be strangled to death by a thug! Quickly rescue the hostage and shoot the criminal!"

A tall man in uniform got out of the first car and came to my side: "Captain Frank, I'm the leader of your local security team in this city. You can call me Kevin."
