Nick didn't have my son's guts. He immediately started crying for his parents.

I messaged my domestic contact, asking about my son's recent situation. He replied that my wife had already arranged for a guaranteed college admission, and my son just needed to report directly when school started.

I had just heard my wife helping others bully my son, and now he's telling me she's arranging for his guaranteed admission?

I coldly asked, "Is this how you handle logistics support?"

"I'm going to file a complaint against you at headquarters!"

Putting down the phone, I grabbed Nick by the collar, slapped him twice, and demanded, "Why did you tear up Sam's acceptance letter?"

Nick, terrified and covered in tears and snot, stammered, "He scored 600 points higher than me. I felt humiliated and wanted to vent."

A bright red Porsche pulled up at the school gate.

Nick excitedly shouted, "Mom, Mom, save me! This lunatic is beating me for no reason!"

I hadn't expected to meet my ex-wife Claire in this scenario.

She was dressed garishly, dripping with jewelry.

Stomping over in her ridiculous red high heels, she screeched like a fishwife, "Let go of my son!"

Her son?

I looked closely at Nick. No mistake, this kid had always looked like a rat.

How did Nick become her son?

I blocked her clawing hand with my arm, causing her to lose balance and fall.

Nick muttered under his breath, "Useless."

But Sam went over to help her up.

Claire pointed her fat finger at Sam's forehead. "Can't you just behave?"

"Stop provoking your brother, okay?"

"You have food to eat, school to attend, and I can live this good life now, all thanks to your uncle, right?"

"And you? Every time the school calls home, it's either about you stealing watches or tearing up his homework!"

"So what if he gets back at you once?"

"You're just as useless as your dead father!"

Sam stood his ground, declaring firmly, "My dad is a great hero. He'll come back for me someday!"

Claire spat, "Your deadbeat dad is long gone. Give up that pipe dream, he's never coming back!"

Enraged, I grabbed Claire's arm, pulled her close, and slapped her twice. "You bitch, do you know who I am?"

"I've been risking my life out there, building a fortune for you all."

"If you wanted to be a slut and find another man, fine. But why did you have to hook up with my brother and treat my son like this?"

Claire looked me up and down in shock, her eyes filled with disbelief.

Suddenly, her expression changed, and she started screaming, "Help! Kidnapper! Someone call the police!"

"Quick, contact my husband! Someone's trying to kidnap us!"

Sam carefully examined me from all angles, tentatively calling out, "Dad?"

Claire viciously kicked Sam. "What are you yelling about? Your deadbeat dad is long gone. Your father now is George."

Sam roared, "George is just using you! His whole family is using you and my dad's identity for their own benefit!"

"Do you think they really see you as a person?"

Several vans pulled up outside the school, and a group of bodyguards with hostile looks surrounded me...
