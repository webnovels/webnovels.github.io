Jasper is a renowned philanthropist in his circle, and I am his assertive wife.

 He has a cherished muse, and I went to great lengths to make him marry me. 

During a covert mission, his muse disappeared. In his quest for vengeance, he broke my legs, locked me in a dungeon filled with water, and tormented me relentlessly.

 "I don’t want you dead; I want you to live a life worse than death, repenting for your sins day and night."

 I pleaded with him, insisting I didn't kill her, but he refused to listen. He whipped me, the barbs tearing into my flesh. Until, as an agent constantly protecting him, I was tortured to death.

 Then, his fragile muse appeared, pointing a gun at him and revealing her true identity as an assassin, leaving him in a state of madness over his regrets.
