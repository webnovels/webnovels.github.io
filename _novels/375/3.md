But what about Chloe?

She already had all the love from my family; what else could she possibly want?

After floating home, I became even more quiet and withdrawn.

Before, no matter if Mom and Dad could hear me, I would tirelessly share interesting things.

Now, I would just curl up in a corner, a silent observer.

Chloe had a heart episode.

It was said she was provoked at school.

Dad investigated and found that my supposed pregnancy out of wedlock had also caused Chloe to be talked about behind her back.

And Dad had never hidden the fact that Chloe was adopted.

This also led to Chloe being excluded and targeted.

Chloe on the bed was pale as a sheet, yet she looked so strong it hurt to watch.

I inexplicably remembered when Mom had a heart attack before, Chloe innocently said.

“Mommy’s heart is broken? Then I’ll give my heart to Mommy, and Mommy won’t hurt anymore, right?”

At that time, when Mom heard it, the pity on her face was almost uncontrollable.

And I, being oblivious, just quietly peeled an apple and offered it to Mom.

Mom pushed me away, and the apple rolled a few times on the floor, covered in dust.

“Look at your sister, and then look at you. You have no conscience at all!”

But Mom, I truly was willing to give you my heart.

And her heart condition? It was fake.

I guessed Chloe faked her heart episode, perhaps to pull another trick.

Sure enough, after listening to Chloe’s tearful complaints.

Mom and Dad immediately made a decision.

They would publicly announce that Chloe was their biological daughter.

And I was the adopted one.

Michael casually fiddled with the watch I’d given him, fully agreeing. “Chloe is excellent in every aspect. I have no objections.”

Dylan’s face, however, was full of sarcasm.

“I have no objections either. Audrey did such disgraceful acts, I stopped wanting to acknowledge her as my sister a long time ago. It’s Chloe who makes us proud, always top of her class.”

Chloe covered her face with a pillow, feigning embarrassment.

“Dylan, don’t say that.”

On the sofa, the family of four was warm and harmonious, but I felt a chill.

Their faces, in my eyes, began to look strange and distorted.

It seemed my existence in this family had long become irrelevant, even superfluous.

For the first time, I began to waver. Was everything I gave worth it?

After all decisions were made, Chloe wore a sated smile.

But at dinner, Michael suddenly suggested bringing me back.

The entire family’s forks froze.

After a while, Dylan nodded.

“Good idea. That girl’s been out causing trouble for so long, she’s probably suffered quite a bit.”

I could hardly believe my ears and stood up from the corner.

Were they concerned about me?

Nearly half a month had passed, had my family finally remembered me?

I wiped away my tears and floated closer.

I knew it, they couldn’t be that heartless.

But before I could even smile, I heard Dylan continue.

“Let’s give her an excuse to come back. Have her return as soon as possible these next few days. Once she’s back, we’ll lock her up.”

I stumbled slightly, my spiritual body feeling unstable.

Lock me up? What did that mean?

Soon, Michael clarified it for me.

“Dylan suggested this. Chloe’s college entrance exams are coming up soon, and I’m worried that if Audrey keeps not showing up, she’ll cause trouble on the day of the exams and ruin Chloe’s future.”

“So, we’ll just coax Audrey back home, lock her up, and prevent her from affecting Chloe’s exams.”

As his words fell, the light above flickered for a moment, then returned to normal.

I collapsed to the floor, my face numb.

Mom hesitated. “What if she comes home and insists on taking the college entrance exams? After all, it was originally her year to take them…”

Dylan eagerly interrupted. “Mom, have you forgotten she’s pregnant? That bastard child, we don’t even know how far along she is! Do you want her to go to the exam hall with a big belly? Haven’t we lost enough face already?”

Ultimately, the entire family reached an agreement.

For the first time since I disappeared half a month ago, they actively called my phone.

The call connected quickly; it was an unfamiliar man’s voice.

“Hello, this is Evergreen Funeral Home. Are you Audrey’s family? You finally picked up! Please come over as soon as possible!”

Dad’s hand, holding the phone, trembled. “What?”

Michael and Dylan, hearing this, also uncharacteristically looked flustered and helpless.

Chloe subtly raised an eyebrow, a hint of malicious glee in her eyes.

Only Mom, exploded in a rage.

“Audrey, have you made enough trouble? Isn’t half a month of messing around outside enough? Do you really want me to disown you?”

I calmly lowered my gaze, my eyes hollow.

Then disown me.

Anyway, I had nothing left.

I was only grateful now that I was dead, so I didn’t have to live and endure this endless torment.

Dad looked at Mom, bewildered.

“What in the world is going on?”

Mom explained the call on the day of Chloe’s party, then her face tightened with gritted teeth.

“How could she be dead? If it were an accidental death, the police would have notified us. This is just her retaliating against us, playing a deliberate prank.”

I gave a sarcastic smile.

Of course, I didn't die by accident; it was a premeditated suicide.

Because heart donation could only be done after death.

At that time, I was naive enough to think Mom wouldn’t accept my heart.

So I signed an anonymous donation agreement and arranged for a one-stop service with the funeral home.

I was supposed to die quietly, and my parents would discover it later and report my death certificate.

But I never expected Dad to cancel my card, which led to my body not being cremated for so long.

The funeral home had a thirty-day free storage period. If cremation wasn’t done after that, they would call the police to handle it with the family.

Mom took the phone, her face cold.

“Audrey, you were shameless enough to get pregnant out of wedlock, bringing endless shame to our family, and now you’re still so inconsiderate, playing such a cruel joke. I’m truly disappointed in you.”

On the other end of the line, there was a long silence.

The funeral home employee asked, bewildered.

“Who’s pregnant? This 19-year-old female body has no reproductive function whatsoever. Are you even Audrey’s family?”

“Tomorrow is the final deadline. If you don’t come to pay the fees and claim the body, we’ll have to contact the police to issue a public announcement for identification.”


This time, the employee's tone was very stern, and he hung up after speaking.

Mom's cold expression froze, and she stood motionless.
