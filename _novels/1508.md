The day I got the positive pregnancy test, I did something I hadn’t done in years. I went to Frank’s office.
Through the glass wall of the conference room, I couldn’t resist calling his phone.
But then I saw her—the woman sitting next to him, his secretary—pick up his phone and decline the call without a second thought.
Then, with practiced ease, she unlocked the screen and started typing.
A moment later, a message from “Frank” buzzed on my phone.
“In a meeting. Don’t call unless it’s an emergency.”
I stared at the words for a long time.
When I looked up again, I saw her, in front of everyone, affectionately adjusting his slightly crooked tie.
I calmly typed back.
“Fine. Are you two coming out, or am I coming in?”

01
The moment our eyes met, the panic on the woman’s face vanished, replaced by a perfectly composed expression.
She leaned close to Frank’s ear, whispering something.
The gesture itself wasn’t scandalous, but her expression was tinged with a delicate sense of grievance.
When Frank finally looked up at me, his brow furrowed in annoyance.
He gave her shoulder a reassuring pat before striding toward me.
“What is it?”
His voice was cold, laced with the irritation of having his work interrupted.
The tie around his neck was one he’d been wearing often lately.
It wasn't a gift from me, nor was it one he’d bought himself.
I’d heard it was a thank-you gift from his secretary after the company’s annual gala.
What I hadn’t known was that this “secretary” was a new, stunningly beautiful young woman.
I glanced at the woman who remained in the conference room.
“Why don’t you have her come out too?”
He pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed.
“I told her to hang up. I told her what to send.”
“Chloe just graduated. She can be a bit impulsive, but she means well.”
“Don’t go scaring a young girl like that.”
In the five years I’d been married to Frank, I’d rarely heard him say so much at once, except at business functions.
And now, he was doing it to defend another woman.
A woman who knew his phone password before his own wife did.
The joy I had felt on my way here had completely evaporated.
I let out a bitter laugh.
“Frank, do you think I’m blind?”
I stood and stepped closer to him, trying to read the real emotion in his eyes.
“Tell her to come out.”
Before Frank could refuse, a petite figure stepped between us.
“Mrs. Vance, I’m right here.”
The woman’s face was a picture of innocent, delicate features, but her eyes held a defiant pride.
“You probably don’t realize how crucial this meeting is for Mr. Vance.”
“From your perspective, I hung up on the CEO’s wife. But from Mr. Vance’s perspective, an interruption like that could become a black mark on the company’s record.”
“I may not be important, but I have a duty to ensure Mr. Vance’s work proceeds without a hitch.”
“Mrs. Vance, if you have a problem, take it up with me. This has nothing to do with Mr. Vance.”
As I watched the look of admiration grow in Frank’s eyes, the whole situation felt absurd.
Over the years, plenty of women had orbited Frank, trying to get his attention.
The flirtatious ones, the aloof ones, the ones who threw money and resources at him.
I had observed them all, even tested a few.
But I never knew his type was this… corporate zealot.
“Take it up with you? Alright.”
I made a show of looking at the name badge on her chest.
“Chloe, is it? As of this moment, you’re fired.”
The pride on her face shattered instantly.
“On what grounds can you fire me? This is Mr. Vance’s company! I work for him, and my conscience is clear!”
I sneered.
“On the grounds that I’m his wife. And the second-largest shareholder in this company.”
Tears welled in Chloe’s eyes, threatening to spill over.
“Stella, have you made enough of a scene?”
Frank’s voice was like ice.
“This is a company, not your personal playground where you can throw tantrums whenever you please.”
“It was one missed call. What on earth could be so important? Go on, I’m all ears.”
The man who was always so composed and distant was now red-faced with anger.
I had never seen him so openly emotional, not even the year he took a bullet for me.
Behind him, the conference room door was ajar. A room full of executives sat in dead silence, their expressions knowing.
From now on, I, the rarely seen Mrs. Vance, would be the butt of all their jokes.
At that thought, I calmly picked up the test results I’d placed on the table.
Frank’s eyes narrowed at the movement.
“What’s that?”
“Nothing,” I said. “Just a piece of scrap paper.”

Frank clearly wanted to say more.
But then my phone vibrated.
The name “Dad” on the screen silenced him.
My father’s voice was filled with an undisguisable joy and affection.
“Stella, honey, tell Frank to put his work on hold. I’ll personally oversee the waterfront project for him. His priority right now is taking care of you and the baby. I’ll fly back in a couple of days…”
I looked at the impatient man in front of me, my voice strained.
“Dad, you don’t have to.”
There was a pause on the other end, then a note of concern.
“What’s wrong? Tell me, did that boy do something to hurt you?”
Turning away, I fought back the lump in my throat.
“Don’t worry, Dad. I’ll handle it.”
After a moment, a sigh came through the phone, sounding years older than it had a minute ago.
The man who had dominated the business world for decades was always sharp when it came to his daughter, yet he was also helpless.
Just like six years ago, when I endured the first and only slap of my life for the sake of marrying Frank.
The blow had landed on my face,
but it was my father, a man nearing fifty, who had cried first.
“Stella, your mother never suffered a day in her life. How can I stand to watch you go through this?”
My mother was lucky in life, though her life was short.
In a more traditional era, she lived under my father’s protection, giving birth to me at the late age of thirty-six.
But on the very first day I met Frank’s mother, she joked at the dinner table that Vance wives were expected to have a baby in the nursery within a year or two.
Frank had remained silent, but my father had nearly crushed the wine glass in his hand.
I, however, had brushed it off.
Marriage was between two people. The Vances had no significant background. Even with a difficult mother-in-law, I was confident I could build a happy life.
Besides, what wasn’t a man worth who had literally taken a bullet for me?
Chloe’s voice sounded from behind me.
“Mr. Vance, I just got a message from the client. They’ll be here in five minutes.”
Frank’s voice returned to its usual calm.
“Understood.”
As the footsteps faded away, I took a deep breath and lowered the phone, which had long since disconnected.
Suddenly, a pair of high heels appeared in front of me.
It was Chloe.
She was smiling, a mocking glint in her eyes.
“Mrs. Vance, Mr. Vance said that if you need anything in the future, you can tell me directly. I can pass the message along for you.”
Communication between a husband and wife, relayed through a third party.
The implication was crystal clear.
She savored the look on my face for a moment, her expression smug.
“Let me be blunt, Mrs. Vance. Mr. Vance gave me a great opportunity, and I cherish the chance to work with him. I understand how much this company means to him, so I have no intention of leaving.”
“Unlike you, everything I have, I’ve earned through my own hard work. I’d rather have real value in a man’s eyes than just be a trophy wife.”
Her gaze was taunting, a stark contrast to the gentle, determined woman she had been in front of Frank.
I couldn’t help but clutch my handbag tighter, a cold smile on my face.
“You have quite the high opinion of yourself. Frank has never had a shortage of people willing to work for him. Your so-called ‘value’ is worthless to him.”
She didn’t get angry. Instead, she coolly opened her phone’s photo gallery, showing me screen after screen of screenshots of my text conversations with Frank.
“You probably didn’t know this, but Mr. Vance gave me his phone password last month. Which means, since then, the person on the other end of your conversations has been me.”
“Oh, and that sapphire necklace you loved so much for your anniversary? That was my suggestion.”
“That time you asked him to come home early, and shared a picture of that new nightgown you bought? I was the one who convinced him to leave work and go home to you.”
“Do you know what happened after that? I stayed up all night finishing his reports, and the next day, he gifted me a sapphire bracelet, identical to your necklace. I just never wear it… to avoid suspicion.”
CRACK!
The sharp sound of a slap echoed in the air. My fingertips and my heart went numb.
The emotional control I had always been so proud of shattered in an instant.
“Who the hell do you think you are? How dare you touch my marriage?”
She clutched her cheek, her shock lasting only a moment before she started to laugh.
“Are you scared?”
When I didn’t answer, her smirk widened.
“Don’t worry, I’m not the type to use cheap tricks to seduce a man. And I have no interest in breaking up a marriage. Unless,” her tone shifted, her smile turning seductive, “he’s the one who takes the first step. Then I won’t hesitate to walk the other ninety-nine.”
A fanatical gleam lit up her eyes, and it was that look that suddenly brought me back to my senses.
That year, if Frank’s first step hadn’t nearly cost him his life,
I never would have tearfully walked the other ninety-nine.
And now this woman stood before me, gloating, as if it were a badge of honor.
I had my family’s name and fortune to fall back on. What did she have?
“Cat got your tongue?” the woman pressed, unwilling to let it go.
As I turned to leave, I let out a small laugh.
“What else is there to say? Should I wish you luck?”

Of course, Chloe assumed I was just lashing out in anger.
As I left, I saw her, one side of her face red and swollen, click-clacking in her heels straight toward the VIP lounge where Frank was.
She knew exactly how to play on a man’s sympathy to win his favor.
At least in that regard, she was much smarter than I had been.
I was twenty-two when I first met Frank, standing behind my father.
Back then, like everyone else, he would simply bow his head politely and greet me, “Miss Rhodes.”
At first, it was pure attraction. I handpicked him to be my personal bodyguard.
But he never grew arrogant because of my favor, nor did he ever show a hint of annoyance at my unreasonable demands.
He was diligent and serious about his work, but always polite and distant with me.
Later, when I was kidnapped by a business rival, he threw himself in front of me, taking a bullet meant for me.
That bullet nearly killed him.
And it made me fall completely.
During the days he lay unconscious, my dreams were filled with the clean, soapy scent of him as he held me in his arms.
The day he woke up, I stood before him with puffy, swollen eyes, first scolding him for his incompetence, then blushing as I pointed to the graze on my own shoulder, demanding he take responsibility.
My excuse was flimsy, but he nodded.
I was ecstatic.
Little did I know what a difficult path I had chosen for myself.
When I got back to the Vance house, I could hear Frank’s mother’s voice from the living room.
“Young people have it so easy these days. In my time, what daughter-in-law would dare not to serve her mother-in-law? Did you see the look on her face last time I asked her to bring me a basin of water for my feet? Her eyes were practically red with anger!”
“I truly regret it. If she hadn’t chased after him with her money back then, our Frank would never have married a barren saint we have to worship.”
The housekeeper, Maria, chimed in, “You’re so right…”
I pushed the door open.
The room fell silent enough to hear a pin drop.
Maria, who had been cracking sunflower seeds on the sofa, jumped up, a sheepish smile on her face. “Miss Stella, you’re back. Have you eaten? There are some leftovers from lunch, I can go heat them up for you.”
“No, thank you.”
Sensing my coldness, Frank’s mother bristled.
“Stella, there are a million things to do around the house. Why did you run off so early in the morning without saying a word?”
The Vance family rules were strict and archaic.
For a woman, the only value lay in producing heirs, serving her husband, and managing the household.
On my first day of marriage, Frank’s mother handed me a broom and told me to sweep the entire house, saying it was what a proper new wife should do.
I had put up with it for five years, trying my best to please her.
But I never realized she didn’t appreciate any of it.
I let out a cold laugh.
“We have two live-in housekeepers, two cooks, a gardener, and a family doctor.”
“Tell me, what exactly is there left for me to do personally?”
She was probably shocked by my sudden defiance.
She was speechless for a moment, her face flushing red.
“This—this whole household needs managing, doesn’t it? Don’t the corners need checking? What if someone with sticky fingers takes something, are you even keeping track?”
Her words were nasty. Maria’s face fell, and she carried her plate into the kitchen.
I looked at her calmly.
“Aren’t you here? I hired the staff, I pay their salaries, and Frank is never here. So, as the mother of the house, shouldn’t you be pulling some weight?”
Realizing her mistake, Frank’s mother grew even more flustered and angry.
“Why should I have to serve you! You can’t even have a child!”
I looked at her twisted face, my eyes cold.
She was the one who had promised that living together would be temporary, just until she felt we were settled.
Frank had asked me to be understanding.
And so I was, for five years.
For five years, I endured my husband’s coldness and my mother-in-law’s constant passive-aggressive digs.
Slowly, I began to understand the helpless look in my father’s eyes all those years ago.
“A child?”
I glanced down at my stomach with a faint, mocking smile.
Ignoring her shouting behind me, I walked straight to the master bedroom.
Probably due to the pregnancy, I fell asleep the moment my head hit the pillow.
When I woke up, the sky was already dark.
I could hear Frank’s mother’s unusually cheerful laughter from the living room, along with a man’s distinctive voice.
Frank was home?
As I listened, something felt wrong.
I opened the door to a scene of domestic bliss.
Frank was actually chatting with his mother, a rare sight, while Chloe was smiling sweetly, massaging his mother’s feet.
His mother sighed contentedly.
“Where would you find such a perfect girl? So filial and considerate. This is better than any professional masseuse.”
“Frank, you have to treat her well. If you don’t, I’ll just have Chloe come work for us here. It’s not like that wife of yours is anything more than a decoration…”
The man only frowned slightly, a look of helplessness in his eyes.
“Mom, what are you talking about?”
“What am I talking about? She has less and less respect for me every day. What good is all her money? After all these years, she hasn't produced a single heir. I can’t even hold my head up high in front of the family!”
“I think she’s bad luck! Always dressed to the nines and running around outside… Who knows what she’s up to behind your back—”
CRASH!
The vase I threw shattered at their feet.
A woman’s shriek pierced the air.
Frank looked up at me in disbelief, his voice filled with fury.
“Stella! Have you lost your mind!”
I crossed my arms, looking down at him, and let out a soft laugh.
“Mad?”
“No,” I corrected myself.
“I’m more clear-headed than I have ever been.”
