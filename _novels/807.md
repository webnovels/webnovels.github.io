She fell in love with her father's friend, a man 12 years older than her.

The first time she saw him, he was dressed in a sharp suit.

Broad-shouldered and lean-waisted, he was the most dazzling presence in any crowd.

He smiled, patted her head, and gifted her a beautiful princess dress.

When she was 20, he was drugged at a banquet, and she, wearing that very dress, gave up her innocence to be his cure.

The next morning, they were caught in a disheveled state by his childhood friend, Nadine Quill. Shocked, Nadine fled in tears, only to be hit by an out-of-control truck and die on the spot.

From that moment, Alyssa Camden felt that Enzo Slater had become a different person.

He handled Nadine's funeral with chilling composure, married Alyssa with the same calm, shared a bed with her every night without passion, and repeatedly forced her into one abortion after another because he didn't want children.

On her 18th abortion, Alyssa suffered massive bleeding and lay dying on the operating table when she overheard the doctor calling Enzo.

Enzo's voice remained indifferent as he asked, "Is she dead? Call me when she is."

At that moment, Alyssa finally understood that Enzo hated her.

He hated that she had willingly been his cure. He hated that, by sheer misfortune, she had caused Nadine's death.

As she took her last breath on the operating table, regret consumed her.

But when she opened her eyes again, she had been reborn to the very night Enzo had been drugged.

Looking at the usually cold and untouchable man now lying on the bed, shirt unbuttoned, eyes tinged red—like a fallen god from his pedestal—Alyssa felt a myriad of emotions.

In her past life, it was this image of him that had bewitched her. It had driven her to desire him, to ignore that he was her father's friend, to disregard the 12-year age gap, to cast everything aside and become his remedy.

Only later did she learn that Enzo and Nadine had loved each other all along. They simply hadn't had the chance to confess before she had stepped in.

Perhaps the heavens took pity on Alyssa.

Now that she had a second chance, she would do only one thing—bring Enzo and Nadine together.

Without hesitation, she grabbed her phone and dialed Nadine's number.

Nadine arrived in a hurry ten minutes later.

Alyssa grasped her hand tightly. "I know he loves you, and you love him. You just never had the right moment to admit it. Now that he's drugged and needs you, this is the perfect chance for you both to be together."

Nadine had been skeptical when she received the call, but hearing these words, her expression turned even more conflicted, as she was wary of some kind of trick.

"Alyssa, what are you up to? You've been chasing Enzo so openly. Now that he's in this state, instead of taking advantage of it, you're calling me here to bring us together?"

Hearing this, Alyssa let out a bitter laugh.

Indeed, at this moment in her past life, she had pursued Enzo so relentlessly that the whole city knew.

Back then, she believed that if she tried hard enough, she could bridge the gap of status and age.

Now, she understood that as long as he didn't love her, the only thing left for her was a lifetime of suffering, no matter how much she gave.

She had been terribly, terribly wrong in her past life.

Shaking her head, she whispered, "I don't love him anymore. I never will again."

The moment her words fell, a muffled groan of suppressed pain came from inside the room.

"He can't hold on much longer. It'll be too late if you don't go in now."

Following Alyssa's gaze, Nadine looked toward the bedroom hesitatingly.

Finally, as if convinced, Nadine bit her lip. "Why are you still here, then? Planning to listen in?"

Alyssa's body stiffened for a moment before she turned sideways, making way for the woman before her.

The moment Nadine's hand touched Enzo's face, Alyssa shut the door firmly without hesitation.

The next moment, muffled groans from the man and soft gasps from the woman seeped through the thick wooden door, ringing in Alyssa's ears.

One sound after another, their passionate noises slammed into her heart like a hammer, shattering it into pieces, leaving it bloody and raw.

She lost all strength and slid down to the floor.

Tears streamed down her face uncontrollably, yet deep inside, Alyssa felt an inexplicable sense of relief.

She had finally broken free from the fate of her past life.

Frantically wiping away her tears, she stumbled back to her room.

That night, the two in the next room indulged in reckless passion.

Alyssa, however, didn't sleep at all.

At dawn, Philip Camden's call came through.

"Liss, do you want to come live abroad with me?"

Years ago, when Camden Group set out to expand into international markets, Philip had moved overseas alone. Worried that he wouldn't have time to take care of his daughter, he had entrusted Alyssa to his longtime friend, Enzo, to look after her.

And so, Enzo had cared for her for years.

Later, Alyssa fell in love with Enzo. Even after Camden Group had firmly established itself abroad, and Philip had repeatedly asked her to return to his side, she had refused every time.

But now, Enzo and Nadine had finally confessed their feelings for each other.

It was time for Alyssa to leave and live her own life.

At the thought of this, Alyssa exhaled slowly.

"Dad, I want to go abroad."

Philip seemed momentarily stunned by her sudden change of heart. Then, his voice turned noticeably excited.

"Sweetheart, you've finally come to your senses. I told you long ago that Enzo was never right for you! You were too stubborn—no matter how hard you tried, it was never going to work! It's not wrong for you to want love, but you need to find the right person.

"I've already picked a fiancé for you. He's closer to your age. Once you move abroad, spend some time with him and try opening your heart to someone new. There's no harm in that."

Philip's words made Alyssa's already swollen eyes well up with fresh tears.

He had told her the same thing in her past life, but she had been too blinded by obsession to listen.

And because of that, she had wasted her life away.

Digging her nails into her palm, she forced out a smile.

"I'll do as you say, Dad. I'll start my immigration paperwork right away."
