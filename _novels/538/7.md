Zoe sprawled casually on the sofa. "Why can't I be here?"

"This villa is in my name. Who gave you permission to stay here?" Mia demanded. This was Jake's wedding gift to Mia.

Back then, Jake still had Mia in his heart. As newlyweds, they couldn't go abroad due to the pandemic, so the couple chose to honeymoon at the villa. They got snowed in during a blizzard and ended up staying at the villa for two whole months.

Not long after leaving the villa, Mia got pregnant. Later, their relationship cooled to freezing point, and Mia never stayed there again.

"I'll give you half an hour to pack your things and get out of my villa. Otherwise I'll report you for trespassing." But Zoe didn't budge at all.

"You want me to move out just like that? Mia Collins, I've been living here for over a month already, long before you knew I was back in the country."

Zoe pulled open her collar, revealing dense hickeys on her chest. She then led Mia to the master bedroom upstairs and took out a box of condoms from the nightstand.

"On my body, in every corner of this villa, there are traces of Jake and I making love. If you want to see, I can show you slowly. Mia Collins, do you think these can be erased just because you say so?" Mia looked at Zoe's smug face and felt nauseous.

"Why are you so comfortable being the other woman?" She resisted the urge to hit Zoe and turned to leave the villa.

"Mia, it's so late, and the snow is so heavy outside. I don't mind if you stay in the guest room for the night." Zoe sat smiling on the sofa, completely taking on the air of the lady of the house.

"My villa is already dirty. I don't want dirty things anymore. If you insist on staying here, just wait to talk to my lawyer." Mia said, leaving with her luggage.

The snow outside was getting heavier. Mia had only driven about 3 kilometers when her car broke down. She could only call a tow truck company. But with the heavy snow blocking the mountain roads, the tow truck couldn't make it up either.

With the car stalled, there was no more heat. Mia felt so cold. She curled up in the driver's seat, her whole body shaking. After who knows how long, Mia dozily fell asleep.

In her dream, Mia went back to 9th grade. The school organized a camping trip. Mia and her classmates went to catch fireflies at night and got lost. In the end, when the school couldn't contact the parents, Jake directly sent the family helicopter to pick her up from the mountains.

.......

When Mia woke up again, she found herself lying in a hospital bed.

"How did I end up here?" Mia woke up to see busy nurses around her. A nurse replied, "You passed out in your car. The tow truck company brought you to the hospital."

Mia held her dizzy head. The nurse said with concern, "You're a bit anemic and have low blood sugar. It's best to stay for observation." At this moment, another nurse said, "Hey, did you hear about that girl who slit her wrists in the next room? Last night in the heavy snow, her boyfriend sent the family helicopter directly to pick her up."

Helicopter? Mia was stunned for a moment hearing those three words.

"That's the Sanders family of Deer City. The entire Sanders Aviation belongs to them. What's one helicopter to them?"
