Mia put the ultrasound report on the coffee table. "Since you're pregnant, don't do stupid things like slitting your wrists again... Take good care of the Sanders heir."

Zoe said arrogantly, "You saw how worried Jake was about me. I just wanted to test him a little, and he immediately sent a helicopter to pick me up. He even scolded me for being impulsive, saying I almost miscarried."

Mia smiled helplessly. "That's great. Anyway, this whole farce is about to end soon."

"Mia Collins, Jake Sanders married you for three years. Those three years were stolen from me by you. You're just a thief. You stole my competition spot in high school, my outstanding graduate title in college, and then the Australia training spot. Jake is mine. I'm just taking back what's rightfully mine now." Zoe spoke righteously. If Mia didn't know her so well, she might have believed her.

Hearing all this, Mia didn't argue or refute. She just gave Zoe a look of disdain before leaving. That disdainful look made Zoe extremely uncomfortable. Mia Collins actually just walked away like that, without saying a single word in her defense.

Deer City International Airport Control Tower.

While handing over work to Sophia, Mia told her about recent events. Sophia was so angry her eyebrows went all crooked, and she cursed for a full ten minutes.

"Mia, why didn't you slap that bitch a few times? You just left like that? That's letting her off too easy! And what about how she framed you before? Aren't you going to tell Jake about that?" Sophia was truly furious that Mia, the rightful Mrs. Sanders, was being displaced by a homewrecker.

Mia looked out the window and shook her head.

Sophia sighed helplessly. "Those two really deserve each other!"

But Mia just smiled. She gazed at the vast whiteness outside. She truly didn't care anymore. Now Mia only wanted to start a new life, one that truly belonged to her.

As the year end approached, Sanders Aviation held its annual party as scheduled. This time, Sanders Aviation unprecedentedly invited other airport departments. Their air traffic control center was among those invited.

Mia originally didn't plan to go. There were only two days left before she went abroad, and she didn't even have time to pack. But Sophia disagreed. "After that big scene in the cafeteria, if you don't go, people will really think you're the mistress who ruined the scumbag and bitch's relationship. You must go!"

At the party, Mia stood alone with some fruit and a drink, about to head to the balcony to eat, when she overheard people whispering nearby.

"Isn't that Mia Collins from the control tower? Today is Sanders Aviation's event, yet she has the nerve to show up? Talk about thick-skinned."

Mia glanced sideways. The one gossiping was an intern from the ground crew department.

"Exactly. They say she's the mistress. I heard she even went to the Sanders' mountain villa that day, but got stranded there in the heavy snow. What a joke." Another girl sneered.

Sophia had somehow appeared by Mia's side, her face already red with anger. "This is outrageous. I wasn't there last time, but I won't let them bully you like this again!" Mia tried to hold Sophia back, but it was too late. Sophia smashed her glass on the ground, instantly drawing everyone's attention.

Sophia walked up to the two gossiping girls and said, "You'd rather be gossipmongers than decent people, huh?"

The two girls were stunned by Sophia's aggressive stance, momentarily frozen in place. Mia stepped forward to pull Sophia back. "Let it go. It's better to avoid trouble."

Sophia shook off Mia's arm and started berating the girls directly.

"You don't know anything about the situation, yet you're spreading rumors here? Be careful, or I'll sue you for defamation!" Although Sophia was just a small-time air traffic controller, her father was the second-in-command at Deer City International Airport. She wasn't afraid of causing trouble at all.

One of the gossiping girls rolled her eyes. "A mistress is a mistress. Go ahead and sue. I'd like to see who the real mistress is!" As soon as she finished speaking, Sophia grabbed an untouched glass of orange juice from nearby and threw it directly in the girl's face.

Seeing the situation escalating, Mia hurriedly tried to pull Sophia away again. "Sophia, stop it. This is the annual party, it's not appropriate! Listen to me!"

Mia was about to drag Sophia away when she saw Zoe striding towards them.
