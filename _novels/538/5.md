Sure enough, Mia was called to Mr. Chen's office. "Mia, do you know there was a pregnant woman on Sanders 9523? Now because of the delayed landing, she went into premature labor and is hemorrhaging heavily. The family wants to file a complaint against our airport."

Mia had a clear conscience. She hadn't deliberately delayed just because the captain of Sanders 9523 was Zoe.

"Southern 8744 had a blown right rear tire. The situation was urgent. If not handled promptly, all the passengers on that flight would have been in danger. I was also monitoring the takeoffs and landings of other flights simultaneously and didn't neglect anything." Mia calmly explained, her emotions stable.

Mr. Chen rubbed his forehead. "Now Zoe has received a complaint and is insisting you didn't arrange a landing runway promptly. She's clearly trying to shift the blame to you."

Mia handed the coffee on the desk to Mr. Chen. "The leaders can review the surveillance footage of the situation at any time. I have a clear conscience and am not afraid of her shifting blame." With that, Mia returned to her station to work.

During her break, Mia went to the cafeteria to buy coffee. Unexpectedly, while in line, the person in front suddenly stepped back, causing Mia's coffee to spill on her blouse.

"Ah..." The girl who got splashed turned around, meeting Mia's apologetic gaze. It was actually Zoe?

Mia instantly came to her senses. "I'm so sorry, I bumped into you. Let me help you clean up." Mia was about to take out some wet wipes to help Zoe clean up when Zoe suddenly knocked Mia's coffee to the ground.

"You again, Mia Collins. Are you deliberately trying to make things difficult for me today?"

It was clearly Zoe who had stepped back into Mia, but the way she said it made it seem like Mia had bumped into her.

"I didn't do it on purpose. Besides, you were standing still, why did you suddenly step back?" Mia didn't back down and quickly retorted.

"Don't think I don't know. When I was landing earlier, you deliberately didn't assign me a runway, almost getting me grounded. Mia Collins, what exactly are you trying to do?" Zoe looked furious.

"I made no mistakes in the tower control procedures this morning. As for you getting complained about, that's your problem. I'll compensate you for a new uniform later." Mia said, turning to leave.

Unexpectedly, Zoe grabbed her and poured her own coffee on Mia. Taking advantage of Mia's shock, she slapped Mia across the face. Colleagues nearby who couldn't stand by any longer rushed over to pull Zoe away.

"Captain Parker, let's talk this out. How can you hit someone?" Mia held her face and looked up. The person speaking was the co-pilot of Sanders 9523, who used to be Jake's apprentice.

But Zoe wouldn't let it go. "You were there during landing today. She deliberately retaliated against me for complaining about her earlier. Now I'm the one getting complained about by passengers. Slapping her is getting off easy."

Zoe was known for her loud voice. More and more colleagues gathered around. Mia had never suffered such humiliation in her life. She was about to hit back when her raised hand was grabbed by another hand.
