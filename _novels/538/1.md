The car hadn't driven far when Jake became impatient. "What is it? What did you want to talk to me about?"

Seeing Mia not speaking, Jake got a bit angry. "You said you had something to discuss with me, now you're not talking? Mia, cat got your tongue?" Mia glanced at the driver and was about to speak when Jake's phone rang.

"Bro, Zoe seems to have gotten drunk. Can you come back and check on her?" Jake had the call on speakerphone, and Mia could hear every word clearly.

Jake spoke coldly, "Since you have nothing to say, then don't say it. Get out of the car. I'm going back to the bar." Mia was stunned. The driver, Mr. Johnson, tried to smooth things over: "I can drive Mr. Sanders back to the bar first, then take Mrs. Sanders home."

Mia looked at the cold Jake and said, "No need. I'd like to walk for a bit." After Mia got out of the car, she watched Jake's car drive away, feeling particularly calm.

This wasn't the first time Jake had abandoned Mia. Two years ago, Jake accompanied Mia, who was three months pregnant, for a prenatal checkup. Halfway there, he got a call that Zoe had been in a car accident abroad.

Jake panicked and slammed on the brakes, causing the car behind to rear-end them. Mia felt a faint pain in her belly but didn't say anything.

Mia never expected him to call his assistant to the scene with just one phone call, leaving behind a curt "Little Sun will be here soon," before rushing straight to the airport.

The belly pain that was originally just a dull ache turned into threatened miscarriage due to Jake's actions. By the time Mia was sent to the hospital, the baby was already gone.

"The marriage contract is for three years. If you don't conceive a child for the Sanders family within three years, you will initiate the divorce. And you cannot disclose to others that you and Jake are married."

When Mia woke up, her mother-in-law Evelyn Sanders' words were vivid in her mind.

Mia's father had once been a civilian airline captain, but died in a plane crash. That flight was originally supposed to be flown by Jake's father, Richard Sanders. They had switched shifts, and Richard Sanders narrowly escaped disaster because of this.

After that accident, Richard Sanders returned home to inherit the family business. Mia's mother, who already had depression, couldn't bear the blow and committed suicide. The Sanders family felt they owed the Collins family, so they adopted Mia.

When the Sanders family first adopted Mia, her classmates at school often ostracized and mocked her. As long as Mia got first place, she would be accused of cheating. Every time, it was Jake who actively stood up to defend Mia.

"Mia is part of the Sanders family, my own family. If you can't stand it, get lost!" Jake would say.

Jake's mother Evelyn didn't like Mia and felt that Mia's father was simply unlucky. The Sanders family had no responsibility to raise Mia. But unable to argue against her husband and precious son, she could only accept it.

Until Zoe's appearance completely shattered Jake and Mia's relationship.
