After drafting the divorce agreement, Mia fell into a groggy sleep.

In the middle of the night, Jake stumbled drunkenly into the master bedroom and turned on the light. Mia groggily got up. "What's wrong?"

"What did you come to the bar to find me for today?" Jake was drunk.

"Let's talk when you're sober." Mia pressed the switch by the bed, plunging the room back into darkness.

Click. Jake turned the light on again. Then there was a loud crash. Mia poked her head out from under the covers again. The crystal ball that had been on the TV stand in the master bedroom had been smashed by Jake.

"Weren't you just jealous that Zoe is back, so you came to the bar to see what exactly I was doing with her?" Jake's alcohol-laden breath spewed these words, the air filled with the smell of liquor.

Mia walked over to the pile of glass shards, crouched down, and began picking up the pieces one by one. "This crystal ball was the first gift you gave me when I got into the top high school at 15. Don't you remember?"

Mia's voice was shaking. Over the years, as the rift between them grew, Jake rarely gave her anything. Only this crystal ball, Mia had always cherished.

"It's just a crystal ball. I'll buy you another one later if you want." Jake's anger subsided a bit when he saw Mia was about to cry.

"It's just Zoe Parker, yet she can make you smash the gift you gave me. She really is special to you." Mia laughed coldly. Hearing this, Jake's temper flared up again.

"Mia, aren't you just jealous that Zoe is a pilot now while you're only an air traffic controller? It's not like you've only been jealous of her for a day or two. Otherwise you wouldn't have pushed her down the stairs." After saying this, Jake left the master bedroom.

Mia's shoulders shook. So in Jake's eyes, this was the kind of person she was. Mia held back her tears and put the crystal ball shards in a drawer, unable to sleep all night.

The next morning, Mia came to the living room and saw Jake eating breakfast while on the phone. She took out the divorce agreement, flipped to the last page, and brought it to Jake.

Jake didn't look at any of the content, just signed his name at the signature line. Even after hanging up the phone, he didn't think to read the agreement carefully.

"It will take effect in one month." Mia said, taking the agreement and walking towards the second floor master bedroom. Jake looked at his phone while muttering, "Why is the stray animal agreement expiring so early this year? Isn't it usually at the end of the year?"

Jake had no idea that in just one month, Mia would have nothing to do with him anymore.
