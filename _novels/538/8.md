Mia got out of bed and went to the next room. She heard Jake's reproachful voice coming from inside.

"Zoe, can you not be so impulsive next time? I just said the heavy snow blocked the roads so I couldn't come see you today. How could you do something to hurt yourself like this?" Mia hadn't heard Jake speak so gently in a very long time.

"If Mia hadn't come to the villa and called me a homewrecker, I wouldn't have wanted to see you so badly. I'm sorry, Jake." Zoe pressed her whole body against Jake.

"She's really getting more and more out of line." Jake gently hugged Zoe, comforting her softly.

Mia couldn't listen anymore. She quickly checked out of the hospital and stayed at Sophia's place for a few days.

Five days later, Mia returned home. As soon as she reached the front door, she saw the housekeeper Mrs. Johnson's strange look.

Mia had an ominous feeling. Sure enough, as soon as she entered, she saw Zoe eating in the dining room, her face full of satisfaction and enjoyment.

Needless to say, this must have been approved by Jake. "Mia's back? Oh right, I just got out of the hospital. The doctor said I need to rest and recover. Jake couldn't bear to let me stay in a hotel alone, so he brought me back here."

Jake saw Mia's look of contempt and came over guiltily to take her luggage, explaining, "Where have you been these past few days? Why didn't you tell me you weren't coming home? Zoe hasn't found a suitable place yet, so she's just staying with us for a few days."

Mia coldly moved Jake's hand away. "The master bedroom is definitely dirty now. I'll go to the guest room."

Mia moved all her things to the guest room, planning to stay there from now on. She started the process of selling the mountain villa. Remembering Evelyn saying "The Sanders family has treated you well all these years", she felt she could never repay what she owed the Sanders family.

The visa for England went through exceptionally smoothly. These days, Zoe lived in Jake and Mia's home, living each day like the lady of the Sanders house. Mia left early and returned late every day, ignoring Zoe and Jake's existence whenever she came and went. The mountain villa sold successfully. Along with some handbags and jewelry she had, Mia prepared a card with 60 million dollars.

A week before leaving, Mia found a piece of paper under the sink in the first floor bathroom. Curious, she picked it up and opened it. It turned out to be an ultrasound report for a pregnant woman, with Zoe Parker's name clearly written as the patient. The moment she saw those three words, Mia felt like something snapped in her brain. Jake Sanders, you really are efficient.

In such a short time since Zoe returned to the country, she was already pregnant with his child.

At this moment, Zoe's voice came from the living room. "Mrs. Johnson, what are we having for dinner tonight?"

Mia put the ultrasound report in her pocket and walked calmly to the living room. Zoe suddenly turned around, clearly startled. She clutched her chest and screamed, "My god, where did you come from? You scared me to death." Zoe glared at Mia and tossed her purse aside, sitting down on the sofa.

She twirled the ring on her finger while watching Mia take out the ultrasound report. "What's this about? Whose child is it?" Mia questioned.

Zoe snorted coldly. "Mia Collins, what do you think?"
