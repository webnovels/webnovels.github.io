Our pack of shifters, we all suffer from a strange, burning hunger.
If we don't find our true mate by the age of eighteen, we're plunged into an endless heat cycle.
Last month, I turned eighteen.
But tragically, I searched every corner of our pack and couldn't find my mate.
Almost every night, I could catch the potent scent of my cousin, Diana, and her mate, Zephyr, making love.
It was pure torment!
Slowly, I began to fantasize about Zephyr's touch, his kisses, even the thrill of his fangs sinking into my skin.
Then came that trip back to her parents' home with Diana, the train rattling through the wilderness.
In the dead of night, Zephyr actually pinned me beneath him, his blazing Alpha scent consuming me instantly…


It was Christmas Eve when Diana invited me to her family's place.
Only when we got to the station did I realize her partner, Zephyr, was coming along to meet her parents too.
My mouth fell open slightly.
Zephyr was a solid six-foot-three, his powerful Alpha physique radiating an almost suffocating presence.
His gaze landed on me, scrutinizing, laced with a raw, primal interest.
I knew exactly how I looked.
As an Omega, I’d developed faster than others my age. Tonight, the V-neck top I wore showed off my curves unmistakably.
My short skirt felt almost nonexistent, leaving me utterly exposed before such a powerful male.
He stood behind me, his gaze like a physical touch, burning my skin.
It dawned on me, a little too late, that with his superior height and senses, I probably couldn't hide a thing.
I instinctively pulled my top closer, my cheeks flushing.
He subtly shifted his eyes, then offered to grab some supplies for the journey.
Watching him walk away, his steps—the gait of a top predator—were full of power and control.
I couldn't help but whisper to Diana, "I heard... Alpha mates have to endure incredibly strong... physical needs. Is that true?"
A flush spread across Diana's face, mixed with a hint of fatigue. "Absolutely. Zephyr's strength and possessiveness are beyond ordinary. Every coupling feels like a conquest." She lowered her voice, a touch of boastfulness in it. "His physique... it's far beyond a regular Alpha."
I gasped.
My heat-driven instincts made me shiver with both fear and curiosity.
To be pinned beneath a being like that...
My gaze involuntarily tracked Zephyr.
Even when he simply walked, the Alpha's oppressive aura hit me in waves.
They say Alphas are completely different when aroused...
I secretly imagined his potential size, and my legs instantly felt weak.
Such a powerful presence... what would it feel like to be beneath him?
Diana had mentioned Zephyr's needs were incredibly intense.
No wonder every time I saw her, she carried the scent of deep satisfaction, mingled with exhaustion.
Lost in thought, Diana leaned in, winking. "You haven't found your mate yet, have you, Selene? Want to... experience the difference of a top Alpha?"
My breath hitched, and I bit my lip, my heart pounding like a drum with my heat's insistent urges. "Diana! Don't joke like that!"
But when I looked up, I caught Zephyr's eyes. At the words "haven't found your mate," a flash of intense, predatory darkness crossed his gaze.
Finally, we boarded the train.
Diana had booked a private sleeper cabin.
It was just the three of us in this section, a curtain at the entrance providing some privacy.
She and Zephyr lay on the opposite berth.
Diana leaned against him, scrolling through her phone, while Zephyr's hand roamed freely over her waist and back—a possessive gesture from an Alpha to his claimed mate.
