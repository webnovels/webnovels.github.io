In my past life, I died in international waters.

It was only after my death that I realized I wasn't the elite family's son who was switched at birth. I was just a stand-in to take the fall for the real son.

My childhood friend, who climbed her way into the elite family by stepping over me, knew everything all along. She cozied up to the real son, smiling sweetly: "Asher's life is worthless; dying for you is his blessing!"

I mistakenly believed that my biological parents, who betrayed me, would seek justice for me, but they were brutally silenced.

When I woke up again, my childhood friend excitedly grabbed me: "Asher, you're going to be the elite family's young master!"

Fate gave me another chance to return to my past life. This time, I'm taking down that damned elite family.
