Six years later, I saw Serena Hartley again at the alumni mixer.

She was standing just outside the restaurant entrance, shivering slightly in a crisp, light designer dress, stamping her feet to keep warm.

“Liam, I’m so happy you actually came.”

She rushed toward me, her voice the soft, melodic murmur I remembered. “You still remember the maple-pecan cinnamon rolls from the Old Town Bakery, right? I got up at the crack of dawn and waited in line forever for them.” She held out a steaming paper bag. “Hurry, try one. Tell me they still taste the same.”

I pushed the bag back, my expression flat. “I haven’t liked those in years.”

Serena’s smile froze mid-frame. She reached out and took my arm. “Don’t be angry anymore, okay?” Her voice dropped to a plea. “Let the past stay in the past. Please?” She paused, her eyes searching mine. “I told you, no matter what, you will always be the most important person in the world to me.”

Watching her gently wipe away a manufactured tear, the platinum band on her ring finger catching the light, I shook my head.

“No, it’s not going to pass.”

The story went sour, crashed, and burned six years ago.

There was no point in talking about what-ifs anymore.

“When you left for San Francisco without a word, I worried about you for so long.”

I raised my eyes to Serena. She was wearing a meticulously tailored tweed suit—Chanel-adjacent—and speaking with that same gentle, almost liquid softness.

Everyone always said Serena was the ideal wife, the perfect partner. I used to believe it, too. She was thoughtful, attentive, always sensing what people needed. She was the Campus Queen, the ultimate sweetheart, the Golden Girl everyone put on a pedestal. When she became the Student Body President, her popularity skyrocketed.

I genuinely felt that if I hadn’t snagged her early, a perfect girlfriend like her would have been completely out of my league.

That’s why, when she’d stammered out her wish to keep our relationship a secret, I’d agreed without a second thought.

“Liam, if our dating goes public, I’m afraid of too much attention. It’s for us,” she'd insisted.

Back then, I just thought she was being considerate of our privacy.

“Liam, sit here. You get cold easily; that spot by the vent is too drafty.”

As I walked with Serena toward our designated table, she thoughtfully handed me a warm, damp cloth to clean my hands. I glanced at the seating chart. Myself, Serena, and Harrison Pierce were all seated together.

Good. That made tonight’s plan much more convenient. I hadn’t come to this reunion to catch up; I’d come to finally settle a score.

“Well, well. Look who the cat dragged in. The home-wrecking male gigolo.”

That familiar, abrasive voice. I turned and there he was: Harrison Pierce. He draped an arm possessively around Serena, staking his claim.

“Six years later, and you’re still shameless enough to chase her all the way here?”

Serena patted his arm, her voice gentle. “Harrison, please don’t. Liam has probably had a difficult few years on his own.”

The rest of the alumni at the table started buzzing, their eyes darting between us. I didn’t acknowledge Harrison. I just smiled faintly and took my seat.

Harrison’s face darkened, but he just tugged Serena down into the seat directly opposite me.

The small talk started up immediately.

“It’s great to finally have a full reunion this year.”

“I heard not only is Liam Hawthorne here, but even the old class secretary who moved overseas is joining us.”

“Hey, Serena and Harrison, you’ve been married for years now. Why haven’t you had a baby yet?”

“Such a gorgeous couple. It’d be a shame not to have a few more little ones.”

At that, the polished smile on Serena’s face flickered, showing a split-second of unnatural stiffness.

Harrison quickly jumped in. “That’s on me. I’m afraid if Serena has a baby, she’ll split her love for me.” He squeezed her hand. “We’ve faced so many challenges and still made it through.”

He then turned to me, lighting a cigarette with a deliberate air of nonchalance. “Isn’t that right, Liam?” He blew out a plume of smoke. “After all this time, you’re not still fantasizing about my wife, are you?”

Harrison had raised his voice. The entire room heard him.

All eyes in the room were now focused on me. Serena’s eyes, bright with a strange anticipation, seemed to be waiting for my answer, too.

My phone chimed. I used the notification as an excuse to avoid answering, pretending to check a call. My wife was texting: Almost there.

Knowing she was about to join our table, I quickly snapped a photo of the room and sent it to her.

Serena caught the movement. “Liam, you went completely off the grid these past few years. What were you doing?” She leaned forward, concern etched on her perfect face. “Did you run into some trouble?”

“You don’t have to pretend everything is fine. You can tell us. We’re classmates; we’ll help if we can.”

Harrison chimed in, feigning camaraderie. “Yeah, Liam, no need to put on an act for your old college buddies.” He gestured dismissively at my suit. “This whole ‘bespoke’ thing, these unheard-of labels you’re wearing…” He chuckled. “I get it. After all these years, a guy cares about his image and his status.”

Watching Harrison go on and on, I cut him off, my voice even.

“After all those years with Serena, you two really have become exactly alike.”

“So incredibly fake.”

Harrison shot up from his chair, ready to charge across the table. Serena quickly grabbed his sleeve and pulled him back.

The other alumni started playing peacemaker.

“Liam, you dropped out so early. Without a degree, it must be tough to find work, right?”

“Look, you can’t blame everyone else for what happened back then. You did kind of cross a line…”

The chatter went on, a cascade of thinly veiled accusations and casual cruelty. Not one person seemed to care about how I felt.

I let out a short, hollow laugh, which made everyone pause.

When the room fell silent, I spoke, my voice calm.

“That thing? Are you referring to the time I was slandered as the ‘home-wrecking male gigolo’?”

Serena spoke softly. “Liam, you’ve changed so much. You never used to want anyone to bring that up.” She looked at me, still the picture of gentle solicitude, her expression full of concern.

Unfortunately, it was that exact brand of soft, gentle cruelty—her velvet-gloved strike—that had destroyed me over and over.

Serena and I grew up as neighbors.

Unlike the flawless Campus Queen everyone saw in college, her home life was sordid and fractured. Her father was constantly cheating, and their home was a battlefield of fights and abuse. After he tried to sexually assault her during a drunken rage, she convinced her mother to divorce him and they moved near my family to escape his harassment.

My mother constantly praised Serena—a good, sensible girl who took care of her family. My mother gave her free tutoring and always made her a hot meal when no one was home.

Slowly, over time, we fell for each other, and after graduation, we became official.

Serena always said that the moment she first saw me, she knew I was the man she could trust her life to. She’d claimed that, aside from her mother, I was the most important person to her in the world.

She became the perfect girlfriend, attentive and doting, terrified of me suffering even the smallest slight. My mother used to say I must have been a saint in a past life to deserve Serena.

So when she cried and begged me to go to the same university as her, I didn’t hesitate to change my enrollment. I gave up my spot in the pre-law program I loved to follow her to a less competitive school.

I was young then, and I believed that true love was invincible.

If she hadn't been blinded by Harrison Pierce’s relentless pursuit, I truly thought we would be together forever.

In the beginning, Serena was annoyed by Harrison more than interested.

“Harrison is like a mosquito, I can’t get rid of him,” she’d complain. “My personality is too soft. If I try to be harsh, he thinks I’m playing hard to get.”

She started avoiding him, but that only seemed to encourage Harrison. He kept up a steady stream of expensive gifts, and soon, everyone on campus was shipping them as a couple.

Slowly, I noticed her attempts to avoid him turn into quiet companionship. The luxury jewelry she’d once refused was now draped around her neck.

I confronted her about it a few times. Each time, her eyes would well up, and she’d cry, “You know boys are so sensitive about their pride, Liam. If I reject him too harshly, I’ll devastate him. He likes me so much; I can’t be that cruel.”

But the real turning point was when she voted for Harrison for the Student Body Vice Presidency, a position I had desperately wanted.

I was furious and demanded an explanation.

Her beautiful, crescent-moon eyebrows furrowed slightly, but her voice remained soft and musical. “Harrison is so impulsive. If I didn’t vote for him, he’d throw a massive fit and cause a scene. You know he’s like a pampered toddler; it takes so much effort to calm him down.”

As she spoke, the corners of her mouth curled up in a tiny, gentle smile, an expression filled with subtle, unfamiliar warmth.

I had seen the way she used to love me. I knew her heart had shifted.

Yet, I still tried to cling to any proof that she was still mine. I started manufacturing problems and petty drama, just so she would have to use her energy to fix them—just so I could see her still fighting for me.

The final hammer blow came when my tablet synced with her electronic journal.

The cold, unforgiving digital text documented her anxiety and frustration:

【Job hunting failed again. Is it true that people from ordinary backgrounds can never get ahead?】

【Harrison pulled strings with his family. I’m interning at Pierce Group without even an interview.】

【I shouldn’t betray Liam, but… what can he really give me?】

【Liam started trouble again today. I must have spoiled him too much before.】

【The scarf Harrison gave me was over four figures. He really does love me.】

【I’m so sorry, Liam…】

The journal entry stopped on the day of the student election.

I’d always believed you should cherish what you have when you find it, but the result told me that people change.

My girlfriend was gone.

I broke up with Serena. She cried and pleaded for me to stay, but I walked away.

I finally accepted the fact that Serena had only loved me briefly.

However, Serena became the one who wouldn't let go. Beyond the daily flood of texts and calls, she began showing up everywhere I went.

I asked her what she wanted, and her eyes would fill with tears. “Liam, you can let go of three years of history so easily, but I can’t.” Her body would tremble, and the tears would slide down her cheeks, a single drop landing on my heart, making it waver. I told her to give me three days to think.

That very night, Harrison posted their official announcement on social media.

I laughed coldly and blocked her everywhere.

The anger and humiliation festered, and I fell ill the next day. As I drifted in a feverish sleep, I heard someone screaming my name outside. It was Serena.

Unable to contact me and hearing I’d taken a leave of absence, she’d bought me medicine and rushed it over.

“Liam, you never take care of yourself, you get sick easily, and you hate taking pills,” she called up. “I’m going to wait here until you come down.”

The neighbors started peering out curiously. I stumbled out the door to grab the medication.

That evening, Harrison posted about me online:

【Look how shameless the campus gigolo is now @LiamHawthorne】

The post included a badly-timed photo of me accepting the medicine from Serena, making it look like I was trying to pull her into a hug. He included dozens of screencaps of my sweet, loving texts to Serena from years ago, carefully omitting all the time stamps. He even uploaded several heavily AI-edited, suggestive photos of me, implying I was some kind of male prostitute.

The comments were immediately filled with "insider" details:

【He rents a place off-campus just to bring girls home.】

【Don't let the innocent face fool you. He's been the cheapest date on campus for years.】

People didn't care about the truth; they just gorged on the gossip. The post went viral instantly.

Walking around campus, I was met with whispers and looks of disgust.

“God, the nerve of that sleaze… a third wheel and a gigolo.”

I tried to act tough, but every night I had to take an aggressive dose of sleeping pills just to fall asleep. I was the victim of the failed relationship, yet a simple rumor had successfully branded me as the detested other man.

I started to fear leaving the apartment, hiding in my rental, hoping the rumors would eventually die down.

One day, in the cafeteria, one of Harrison’s cronies emptied a box of condoms into my tray of food. I couldn’t take it anymore.

I unblocked Serena and sent a single text:

【Please, help me.】

Serena replied quickly:

【Liam, Harrison is just a little childish, he’s not a bad person.】

【Don’t worry, I promise I’ll clear all this up for you.】

Soon after, the post vanished, and Harrison stopped harassing me. I tentatively started leaving the house. The other students had new gossip, and I faded back into anonymity. The period of cyberbullying felt like a terrible, surreal interlude.

Just when I thought it was all over, a video was uploaded to the campus forum.

It was Serena. She was gently draped around Harrison, her voice soft and pure.

“My heart has only ever been yours, Harrison.”

“Liam and I had a brief acquaintance, but I had no idea about any of the feelings he had for me.”

Her statement sealed my fate, confirming to everyone that I was the shameless, unwanted third party in their perfect relationship. The wave of cyberbullying crashed down again, stronger than before.

My hands trembling, I tried to contact Serena, only to find I was blocked again.

Then, one afternoon, Harrison’s entourage surrounded me in a dark alley, yelling at me to drop my pants.

“What are you pretending for? They already posted pictures. Let us see if you’re as big as they say.”

“Don’t be a jerk, man. Gender doesn’t matter. Let me get my rocks off; maybe I’ll feel bad for you then.”

The group roared with laughter, pinning me to the ground. Several of them roughly started pulling down my jeans. I grabbed a jagged piece of rock from the ground and plunged it into the nearest guy.

In the ensuing panic and yells of pain, I scrambled up and ran for my life.

Because of the incident, my mother was called to the school. Watching my middle-aged mother bow and scrape, apologizing repeatedly to the teachers and the parents of Harrison’s friends, broke me.

What had I done wrong?

In the end, I was forced to drop out. I sank into a deep, debilitating depression, hiding at home. The early-morning wake-ups were harder than the sleepless nights; I would sit alone, waiting for the first hint of daylight before I dared to close my eyes.

My mother never blamed me; she only told me to rest.

Engulfed in the failure of my own love story, I failed to see how hard she was struggling to support me.

One day, a phone call woke me from a deep sleep:

“Liam Hawthorne? Your mother was in a car accident. You need to come down.”

To smooth things over with Harrison’s friends and their parents, my mother had used up all her savings to pay a massive settlement. To take care of me, listless and depressed at home, she had picked up two extra part-time jobs.

Our schedules were completely out of sync, and I rarely saw her when I was lucid.

When I saw her body in the morgue, I realized how utterly selfish I had been. In those six short months, she had aged terribly, her hair streaked with white. I took her now-icy hand and felt the thick, hardened calluses.

My mother had always been meticulous about her hands, calling them a person’s second face. When had she stopped caring about herself for my sake?

I listened, dazed and heartbroken, as the police explained the case. I only vaguely remembered something about a Porsche whose brakes failed, hitting my mother as she crossed the street.

While going through her meager possessions, I saw the small, silk prayer charm I’d bought for her when I was eighteen, now stained dark red with blood. My emotions finally broke. I sobbed and raged, demanding to see the person responsible.

But the driver was just a frail, middle-aged man who worked at a car wash. He claimed he’d taken a client’s car out for a late-night drive and the accident was a terrible coincidence. He was prepared to take the blame.

But when I saw the accident vehicle, I knew it was no accident.

It was the Porsche Harrison always drove around school, the one he constantly showed off. I’d seen Serena in the passenger seat hundreds of times. I knew the license plate number by heart.

I immediately filed suit, insisting this was not an accident. Harrison was brought in for questioning, but he was released again almost immediately.

The person who provided his airtight alibi was Serena.

“Why, Serena? Did you forget everything my mother did for you when you were a child?” I yelled, grabbing her arm.

Serena only stood there, gently weeping, then softly put her arms around me. “Liam, you can’t accuse Harrison of something so terrible based only on suspicion.” She pulled back slightly, looking into my eyes. “I promise I will stay with you, right by your side, until you get through this. Okay?”

After hearing those words, I suddenly felt a profound calm.

Why bother with a broken umbrella when you’re already drenched?

In that moment of total despair, I stopped complaining. I left for San Francisco, cutting all ties.

At the table, the class president, oblivious, excitedly announced the formal start of the reunion, snapping me out of my memory.

My wife texted: I’m at the door.

Harrison then stepped onto the small stage, snatched the microphone from the president, and yelled:

“Liam Hawthorne! Six years later, are you still trying to be the home-wrecker?”
