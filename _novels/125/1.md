Bored during the meeting, I decided to chat with my online boyfriend.

"Work's been so stressful lately. Thank goodness my husband is understanding and ran off with someone else. The kid's well-behaved too, since it's not mine."

My online boyfriend sent a "pat pat" sticker and replied: "My poor baby, you're so busy and tired. I wish you could get paid without having to work at all."

"Can I buy your company?"

"I want to be there with you at work."

My boyfriend was being so cute, I decided to tease him a bit: "Show me your abs, babe!"

"I'm in a meeting, love. Can we do this later?"

I was about to reply that I was just joking when he quickly changed his mind: "Wait for me, baby. I'll take a photo now."

Was he really going to sneak out of his meeting?

He might get his pay docked if he gets caught.

I was frowning, about to warn him not to do anything rash, when my coworker nudged me: "Look at the boss! His face is all red! And for once it's not because he's angry."

Just as I looked up, I saw Marcus stand up with a spring in his step: "Excuse me for a few minutes."

As soon as the boss left, Lily leaned in to gossip: "I heard from the marketing team that the new brand ambassador our company signed last month might be the boss's girlfriend. You know, that actress Emma. Do you think she's the one who got our boss all flustered just now?"

Lily sighed after finishing, "Emma's pretty popular though. He probably can't go public with her while her career is taking off. Looks like they'll have to keep it under wraps for a few years. Poor boss."

I wasn't particularly interested in the boss's private life and was trying to figure out how to brush off the topic when my online boyfriend sent over a few shirtless photos.

Great! Looks like my slim, toned boyfriend might be worth meeting in person after all!

I couldn't help but smile as I zoomed in on the photos.

While admiring my boyfriend's great physique, I absent-mindedly responded to Lily: "Different industries, different worlds. I hope it works out for him."

I couldn't hold back a laugh when I saw my boyfriend's amazing body.

But before I could properly compliment him, Lily peeked over.

"Watching a funny video?"

Afraid she'd discover I was in an online relationship, I quickly switched to a video feed and said with a grin: "Yeah, smartphones are so much fun."
