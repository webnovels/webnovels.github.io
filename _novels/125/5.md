At eleven o'clock that night, I was the only one in the department working overtime.

After finishing the project proposal and shutting down my computer, I posted on social media complaining about the boss exploiting his employees.

My brother commented: "Quit that job, go have some fun. Your big bro will earn money for you to spend."
