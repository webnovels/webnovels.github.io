When Marcus pushed open the door, he wore a grim expression. The meeting room instantly turned into Silent Hill.

Everyone lowered their heads, not daring to meet his eyes.

After sitting back down in his chair, he pulled up last month's ad exposure stats on the projector. Even though the returns had multiplied several times over, he just sat there frowning without saying a word.

I guess it's understandable. All bosses are greedy.

Who cares if he's happy or not, I was feeling pretty excited myself.

I happily teased my online boyfriend: "Honey, let me just say, I'm really broke this month. My paycheck hasn't come through yet."

I couldn't even imagine how flustered my online boyfriend would get.

After sending the message, I didn't realize I had sent it to the wrong person. I was still furiously typing in the input box: My hubby is so handsome and sexy, I want to slide down those abs.

Just as I was about to hit send, Marcus's angry, agitated voice suddenly rang out in the meeting room: "Get out! I'm not your 'honey'."

I clicked my tongue in disdain and whispered to Lily: "What's his problem now? Menopause? Is his temper getting worse with age?"

Lily froze, speaking through gritted teeth: "I suggest you faint on the spot."

I was stunned, catching a glimpse of the chat window on the display screen out of the corner of my eye.

I had a bad feeling about this.

Turning my head to look, sure enough, the sky had fallen!

All the colleagues in the room were staring at me with wide eyes.

An office worker's breakdown happens in an instant.

I had forgotten to switch accounts.

Sneakily sending messages on your phone under the table is just asking for trouble!

I really couldn't understand why the boss's profile picture was exactly the same as my online boyfriend's.

When people are embarrassed, they tend to get busy. I pretended to organize the files on the table, but eventually stood up and apologized with a choked voice: "I'm sorry, honey. I sent that to the wrong person."

No! My stupid mouth, don't say that!

This is so embarrassing, maybe I should just run away.

Before I could take a step, I caught sight of Marcus glaring at me coldly: "How unprofessional!"
