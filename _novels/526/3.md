I was about to pick up my luggage and leave when the door opened again.

Seraphina aimed at me and threw three large bags of trash.

The trash bags weren't tied, and the soup from instant noodles splattered on my pant leg, along with...

Leftover durian.

So, Alex still remembered Seraphina's taste.

Back in high school, many boys who pursued her brought her durian.

Alex was no exception.

But at the time, Miss Seraphina looked down on him, dressed in cheap clothes.

And now, Alex finally fulfilled his dream of feeding durian to the girl he liked.

I don't like durian; I like strawberries.

But he told me strawberries were too expensive and to eat them less.

Hahahaha, love and not love, it's so obvious.

Strawberries and durians, can't you tell the difference between what's cheap and what's valuable?

I stared coldly at Seraphina.

This woman, looking somewhat haggard, was arrogant and brazen, showing no humility for someone staying as a guest.

She trusted him, he doted on her.

What place did an outsider like me have?

"Stella, Alex loves me. All these years, you were just his emotional outlet. If you want to fight me tooth and nail, I advise you to give up. You can't win against me."

Before my rebirth, because of my foolish trust, I tacitly allowed Alex to bring a wolf into our home.

Alex kept promising he only saw Seraphina as a sister.

Because of love, I believed his nonsense.

But in the end, I was crushed, utterly destroyed.

Seraphina certainly had her methods, wrapping Alex around her finger and treating me like a dog.

"You're right. I've always been your stand-in. I knew all along Alex could never truly let you go."

I'd secretly liked Alex since high school.

But his eyes were only on the popular Seraphina.

In college, we unexpectedly reconnected.

He was unusually enthusiastic about seeing me again, completely unlike his previous indifference.

I'd already given up on him, but his flirting rekindled my feelings.

He waited for me outside my dorm for meals.

He took me to the movies on weekends.

We FaceTimed constantly.

My roommates all said my boyfriend and I were so in love.

What they didn't know was...

I paid for all our meals.

I planned every single date myself.

He was the one who kept nagging me to get him gifts for every holiday.

And the only thing he ever gave me that could be called a gift was leftover barbecue, packed up for me.
