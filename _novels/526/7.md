Alex had told me he'd marry me the moment I could afford to pay cash for a million-dollar marital home.

This wasn't just Alex's idea, but mostly his mom, Mrs. Davis, constantly drumming it into my head.

Mrs. Davis always looked down on me because I came from a modest background.

Every time I went to my boyfriend's house for dinner, his mom would find various ways to remind me of my place.

Good thing I woke up. I almost became her easily manipulated daughter-in-law.

I ignored her rapid-fire rambling on the phone and cut straight to the chase:

"Auntie, your son's first love is back. Did you know?"

She paused for a moment, then confessed:

"Auntie knows, but in Auntie's heart, you're the *only* best daughter-in-law candidate!"

"Alex is still young, a moment of impulse is normal. He's just playing around, don't take it too seriously."

Young?

Don't take it seriously?

Are you dense, or am I?

Seeing that I had no interest in continuing the conversation, Mrs. Davis no longer hid her true intentions.

"Stella, your neighborhood seems great! Auntie's windows broke during a recent storm, and none of our rooms are livable. Could you possibly..."

"Yes, of course."

Free labor? How could I say no?
