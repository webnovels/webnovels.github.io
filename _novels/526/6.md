I got into Julian's car, my pant legs smelling of beef instant noodles, and the little cat in my arms emitting the stench of death.

It made me feel a bit constrained.

"Looks like you haven't been doing so great these past few years, gorgeous."

"Why the lost puppy look?"

"Tsk, tsk, tsk, truly pathetic."

Right, Julian's sharp tongue was one of the reasons I rejected him back then.

He had such a beautifully shaped mouth, but only sarcastic words came out of it.

Julian wanted to take me to his private residence, but I refused.

"I have my own place, in Willow Creek."

"Oh, really? You bought a place there? Pretty impressive."

Julian lit a cigarette, a playful smirk curving his lips.

I turned my face away, suppressing the urge to snap at him.

The urge to curse him out.

I knew he was teasing me; my little studio apartment was nothing but a speck in the eyes of a rich kid like him.

And in his eyes, I was probably the same.

Julian drove the car to the underground parking garage and followed me upstairs.

After opening the door and seeing the empty condo.

He lightly scoffed, "No money for decorating?"

I'd just been reborn; where would I find the time for decorating?

Without a word, Julian made a call and had the problem solved for me.

The decor style was a fresh French aesthetic.

The balcony was transformed into a cozy little garden where I could relax.

I buried Luna, my beloved cat who had been with me for two years, right there.

My phone rang. It was Alex's mom, Mrs. Davis.

I locked myself in the bathroom and answered.

"Hello?"

"Stella, dear, did you buy an apartment in Willow Creek? Good girl, you really are something else!"
