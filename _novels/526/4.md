"Stella, catch!"

Seraphina threw another bag at me.

It felt like a large piece of meat...

The bag was tied with a tight knot, but I could still smell the stench of a decaying body.

"What... what is this?"

My hands trembled as I gently placed the bag on the floor.

"What else could it be? It's a welcome gift for you, of course!"

Opening the black plastic bag, I saw Luna, my little cat, her body mangled beyond recognition.

She was soaking wet, drenched in her own blood.

Her ears were gone, leaving two ugly scars.

My head felt like it had been hit by a sledgehammer, ringing loudly.

"My baby, why are you like this?!"

Seraphina seemed quite pleased with my reaction.

She stood with her hands on her hips, laughing hysterically, gasping for air.

"Alex said this was your lifeline! Oh, my god, it's hilarious! I just wanted to see why you'd cherish an animal so much."

Seraphina, you deserve to die a horrible death!

She noticed the murderous intent in my eyes and immediately pulled out a defensive dagger.

I recognized that dagger.

It was a special anniversary gift I'd given Alex in college.

Alex had lied and told me he'd lost it. Turns out, he gave it to Seraphina.

Unarmed, I couldn't fight her directly. Retreat was my best option.

I gathered Luna's tiny body, trembling as I walked downstairs.

I felt so weak, like an old woman on her last legs, as if even a falling leaf could crush me.

"Luna, Mom failed to protect you. Reborn, I never imagined they wouldn't even spare you!"

As I left the street, the sky opened up, pouring rain.

I dragged my luggage, aimlessly wandering the streets, as if the heavy rain could wash away my sins.

A Maybach pulled up beside me. The window rolled down, revealing deep, captivating eyes behind dark sunglasses, twinkling with a mocking smirk.

"We meet again, gorgeous. Need a hand?"
