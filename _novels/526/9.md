The next day, my phone rang.

Mrs. Davis appeared at the apartment complex entrance, carrying large bags.

I gestured to the security guard to let her in.

Mrs. Davis called again, asking me to help her carry things upstairs.

"Auntie, I'm in a meeting right now."

"Just take the elevator up."

After hanging up, I set my phone to do not disturb.

I forgot to tell her: the elevator was under maintenance and couldn't be used right now.

Julian emerged from the bathroom, clad only in a towel.

He wrapped his arm around my waist and said he was going to show off his cooking skills.

A delicious aroma wafted from the kitchen.

"I didn't expect the great young master to know how to cook."

Julian grinned, his spatula dancing like a sword in his hand.

Compliment him once, and he gets all cocky like this.

I was inexplicably in a good mood...

It must have been because I successfully messed with Mrs. Davis!

After breakfast, Mrs. Davis, laden with luggage, had finally climbed all seventeen floors.

Julian opened the door.

He was wearing just a pair of boxers, his eight-pack abs brazenly on display.

Mrs. Davis's eyes lit up at first, then she adopted the demeanor of an elder.

She began pointing fingers at this handsome, shameless young man.

"Oh, my! What an eyesore!"

"Stella! Who is this man?"

"You said you were in a meeting, but you were probably messing around with another man!"

"How is my Alex supposed to save face?"
