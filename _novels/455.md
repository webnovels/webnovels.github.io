I'm a forensic pathologist. While shopping at the grocery store, I discovered human flesh displayed at the butcher counter.

After reporting it to the police, I immediately contacted my niece to warn her to be careful.

A friend reminded me that I should also be concerned about my daughter.

I angrily cursed: "It would be better if she died out there. I never want to see her again."

But what I didn't know was that she had already seen me.

I failed to recognize that the pile of flesh in front of me, waiting for my examination, was my own daughter.
