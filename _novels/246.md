Seven days before my daughter’s wedding, Evelyn, my wife, suddenly turned to me.

　　"Richard," she said, "Chloe's wedding day, maybe you shouldn't go."

I was holding the speech I’d painstakingly copied from the internet, getting ready to practice it for the reception. 

Now, I was being told I couldn't even attend my own daughter's wedding.

　　"Why?" I asked, my voice laced with disbelief.

　　Evelyn replied, "Marcus is back in the States. He says he wants to walk his biological daughter down the aisle."

Just then, Chloe walked over, chiming in.

"Uncle Richard, he *is* my biological father, after all. 

A blood relative. I want my dad to walk me down the aisle."

I looked at the mother and daughter before me. 

Fifteen years of my kindness had been thrown to the dogs.

　　A pair of ungrateful wretches.

In my bitter disappointment, I picked up my phone and called the hotel.

"Hello," I said, "cancel the wedding banquet for seven days from now. 

Change it to my sixtieth birthday celebration instead."
