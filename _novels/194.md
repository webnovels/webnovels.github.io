Married for five years, my husband and I were always affectionate, until late one night when I received a call from the police. 

They informed me that Ethan had been involved in a collision with a large truck. 

When I rushed to the hospital, I was horrified to find Ethan and a young, beautiful woman both pierced through their abdomens by the same steel rod. 

Witnessing this scene, I instantly realized the nature of their relationship. 

To take revenge and ensure Ethan faced consequences, I hurriedly signed the form to waive the surgery.
