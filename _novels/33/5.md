My wedding with Lucas was set for the third day of next month.
A simple wedding.
I never told Lucas about my illness.
Terminal stage, basically incurable.
I also never told Lucas that I had no intention of marrying him at all.
I could accept everything about Lucas.
Except betrayal.
Just thinking about him holding another woman in his arms, kissing her brow and eyes, searching for traces of my younger self in her, made my stomach churn.
Utterly nauseating.
I had been with Lucas since I was eighteen, exactly ten years now.
Now, the doctor said I only had about half a year left to live.
By that calculation, I had wasted nearly half my life on him.
For the little time I had left.
I just wanted to be Aria.
I booked a flight out of the country, wanting to see the world I loved but had never seen while I still had the strength.
And the flight was also set for the third day of next month.
