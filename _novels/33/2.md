I stubbed out my cigarette.
The young girl had just turned eighteen, her face full of collagen, truly innocent.
And, the moment I saw her, I knew.
She looked a lot like me.
Very much like Aria at eighteen.
"You're right about one thing. If Lucas still loved me, you wouldn't exist."
I stood up, my abdomen actually hurting a bit. I leaned on the table for support, not showing it.
"But I advise you not to get in too deep. Lucas doesn't love you, nor does he love me."
"He only loves the Aria in his memories."
The pure, beautiful Aria who died on the path of helping him rise to power.
"In a few years, he'll find a new replacement. By then, you'll be worse off than me."
Actually, I was lying to her.
I was about to die, how could she possibly be worse off than me?
At most, she'd just be dumped when Lucas got bored of her.
