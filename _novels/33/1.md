On the day I was diagnosed with stomach cancer, the young girl Lucas was keeping on the side came to find me.

"I know I'm the other woman," she began, her sincerity terrifying.

She bit her lip, "Sister, I know you're getting married soon, but—"

"Lucas doesn't love you anymore."

"I've been with him for a year. We've slept together 78 times, 53 times in hotels, 21 times at my place."

"And four times at your house, in your bed."

She looked at me directly, "If Lucas still loved you, I wouldn't exist."

I found it amusing.

I lit a cigarette and looked at her through the smoke, "Anything else? Go on."

So she took out her phone and played a video for me.

The angle was discreet, as if secretly recorded.

The girl was crying in Lucas's arms, "Even if you're marrying her out of responsibility, can't you not let me go?"

Lucas pushed her away and threw a credit card at her, "Find a stable man. Being with me isn't good either, it's too dangerous."

"No!" She clung to his waist, pouting, "I'm not afraid of danger."

"Can't you not let me go?"

"Lucas, I won't be a burden to you, I absolutely won't."

Lucas paused.

His gaze swept over her face, momentarily lost.

Then he leaned in to kiss her.
