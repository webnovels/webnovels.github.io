Early in the morning, I crossed off another day on the calendar.
Ten days left until I leave the country.
I heard the door open behind me.
Lucas came in wrapped in wind and snow, took off his coat, and came over to hug me.
He still didn't like my short hair.
His gaze followed mine to the calendar, Lucas looked at the heavily circled date of the third next month and laughed, gently pinching my face, "Can't wait to marry me?"
He counted, "Ten more days."
He buried his face in my neck, "I'll make time these two days to dye your hair back to black with you, and get some hair extensions?"
"You'll be beautiful at the wedding."
"No need."
I looked at the calendar expressionlessly, "Not many days left."
"Short hair is fine too."
Lucas was silent for a while, "Mm."
He let go of me and picked up the coat draped over the chair, "There's a lot to do for the wedding, and Old Three's place was just trashed yesterday. I'm busy lately, I won't be coming back for now."
Lucas stared at me as he spoke.
As if waiting for me to give in.
Waiting for me to say okay, come with me to dye my hair, to get long hair extensions.
But I just looked back at him coldly.
"Go then."
"After all, only ten days left."
Lucas said nothing, turned and stepped into the night.
Never looking back.
