When I met Blake Pearson, he was broke.

I stood by him as he built his business from scratch, helping him become a shining star in the business world.

Just when I thought our love was finally bearing fruit, I saw him proposing to another girl with utmost sincerity.

Standing at the doorway, I heard laughter erupting from the private room.

"Mr. Pearson, we all thought you'd marry Zoe Chapman. Why are you marrying Lily White now?"

Blake slammed his glass on the table. "Don't mention that clingy bitch! It's been 7 years, I'm sick of playing with her!"

The people around burst into laughter, echoing his sentiments.

"I always thought Zoe Chapman looked so high and mighty, turns out she's just a hypocrite!"

Blake downed another drink. "You guys don't know the half of it. She used to ask me when we'd get married every day, like a desperate puppy!"

Seven years of unwavering devotion, shattered in an instant.
