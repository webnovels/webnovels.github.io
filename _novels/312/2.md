Tonight, I’d successfully closed a huge deal.

I’d put on a brave face and drank myself silly.

I had planned to use this bonus as our honeymoon fund, for Liam and me.

But by a cruel twist of fate, I ended up hearing his true thoughts instead.

Destiny truly loves to play jokes on me.

I flexed my numb hand, stumbling towards the restroom.

Looking up, I saw my eyes looked terrifyingly hollow.

I splashed cold water on my face, hoping to calm down.

But somehow, I couldn’t seem to wipe the water from my face.

My eyes just kept getting redder.

A wave of delayed grief hit me like a ton of bricks.

I just crouched there and cried until I had no tears left, setting a five-minute alarm.

When the alarm rang, I slowly calmed down.

The dinner wasn’t over, and the clients hadn’t left yet.

This wasn’t the time to lose myself in emotion.

So, while no one was looking, I slipped back into the private booth.

"What took you so long?"

Arthur, my boss, sitting beside me, turned his head to look.

His eyes burned into mine, as if he could see straight into my soul.

I nervously avoided his gaze, casually made up a lie.

"Ran into someone I knew. Just said a quick hello."

Arthur nodded, saying nothing more.

Ten minutes later, the dinner ended.

A sigh of relief escaped me.

I’d expected to stay until midnight tonight, but it ended so early.

Good.

I’d have a little more time to sort out my messed-up feelings.

And it wouldn’t affect my work performance the next day.

After seeing the clients off, Arthur and I stood at the entrance, waiting for the company driver.

Suddenly, he pointed at the dark circles under my eyes and spoke calmly:

"Go home and get some rest. Your eyes are all red from staying up."

I froze.

Just as I was about to say something, I was interrupted by an angry shout.

"Cassie!"

Not far away, Liam was glaring at us, furious.

"Was I wrong about anything I said just now? If there’s nothing going on between you two, then why did you lie to me tonight and say he wouldn’t be here?"

Before I left for the client dinner, Liam had asked me if my boss would be there tonight.

I’d said no because I truly hadn’t received any notification.

Who knew the client was difficult and insisted Arthur oversee the signing before they’d agree to the contract?

My colleagues had no choice but to ask Arthur to come.

But I couldn't bring myself to say any of this to someone who clearly didn't trust me.

I slapped his hand away from where he was pointing at Arthur, warning him coldly:

"Liam, this is between *us*. Be respectful to other people."

Liam probably hadn’t expected me to disrespect him so openly in front of others.

He gritted his teeth, repeating "Fine, fine" through them.

"This is all because of him, isn't it? That’s why you want to break up with me?

"Well, guess what, I don't agree!"

With that, Liam stormed off in a huff.

Fuming, I wanted to chase after him and argue.

But suddenly, my wrist was grabbed.

I turned my head.

A strange emotion flickered in Arthur’s usually stoic eyes.

"That childish, ridiculous man—is he really worth you going back to him again and again? Cassie, did he save your life or something?"
