The private booth was loud and boisterous.

But Liam's voice cut through the noise, clear as day.

My body went cold. I had to brace myself against the wall to keep from collapsing.

The conversation inside continued.

"I'm telling you, just be straight with her. You finally managed to win Cassie back and sweet-talked her into agreeing to marry you. Don't mess this up now."

It was another voice.

Jake, Liam's best friend.

He was also a witness to our on-again, off-again relationship for years.

Liam waved a hand, shrugging it off.

"What's the point of just nagging me? Why don't you tell her to keep her distance from that boss of hers?"

Jake gave Liam a fed-up kick.

"Cassie already said she wasn't dating him during those three years you guys were broken up…"

"And you believed her? The rumors about her and her boss have been going wild at the office! I was the only idiot kept in the dark…"

His voice grew more bitter as he continued.

"Always working late, always out entertaining clients—who knows if she was actually in the office or in someone’s bed!"

Those words were truly disgusting.

Everyone in the room was too stunned to speak.

And I, standing outside the door, felt my blood run cold.

A shiver that I couldn’t control ran through me.

It’s already tough enough for women in the workplace.

Arthur had only taken me under his wing because I was a former student of his.

I honestly believe I worked myself to the bone to earn this position today.

I've been fair to everyone.

But to avoid Liam misunderstanding, I clearly told him the situation on the very first day we got back together.

Liam had also told me more than once that he trusted me and supported my work.

But I never imagined he was actually thinking this about me behind my back.

And slandering me with such disgusting words in front of all his friends.

If I hadn’t happened to pass by this booth, was he planning to just trick me into marrying him?

That would be absolutely terrifying.

In that instant, my brain made the decision faster than my heart.

I pulled open the door, walked straight up to Liam.

Before he could even react.

*Smack!* The sound echoed through the entire room.

I slapped Liam.

It landed with a lot of force.

Two seconds later, the girl beside him shrieked, crying as she reached out to touch his face.

But Liam abruptly pushed her away.

He stood up, flustered, and started to explain to me.

"Listen, I can explain…"

"Liam, we’re done."
