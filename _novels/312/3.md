Arthur was a year ahead of me in school.

He was a campus legend I'd heard about frequently during my college years.

Everyone who knew him always praised how gentle and polite he was in how he treated everyone.

And in the three years I’d worked under him, he’d lost his temper with me only twice.

Once was when I first started.

I’d swallowed my pride and put up with a harassing client just to get the company a deal.

He chewed me out for not knowing how to protect myself.

The second time was just now.

He mocked me for being upset over a worthless man.

But what Arthur didn’t know was that Liam really *had* saved my life.
