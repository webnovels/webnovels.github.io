Lucas was furious, punching the hood of his luxury car so hard it dented. He even wanted to call a board meeting the next day to kick Zack and our mother-in-law out of the Gray family.

Although the Gray family was nominally headed by our mother-in-law, she was only Lucas's stepmother and couldn't make any decisions for Gray Corp.

The "black baby" incident orchestrated by my father and sister was indeed a good strategy. It could both throw Lucas off balance and allow Zack to take over smoothly.

But how innocent were my son and I! He was so young that when he fell into the sea, he was pushed down by the waves without even a chance to struggle.

How pitiful that all three of us died unjustly!

After Lucas calmed down, he decided to play along with their plan. It would be a shame not to take advantage of such a perfect scheme.

So he took me abroad in secret, arranged for a professional medical team, and induced my baby early.

When I was lying on the bed writhing in pain after the induction, Lucas was so distressed he almost cried. "Lily, I've let you down."

Soon, I gave birth to a healthy baby boy.

Lucas spent a fortune to put him in an incubator.

When we returned to the country, I kissed him over and over again, reluctant to part. This was the child I had given birth to, not some illegitimate child.

Originally, my sister and I were due on the same day, but now that I had already given birth to a healthy child, there was no chance for them to swap babies. How would my sister face the Gray family's expectations now?

When the time came, it wouldn't be me who would be driven out of the Gray family!

Thinking of this, I couldn't help but smile.

Perhaps because of the slaps from the bodyguard, my sister suddenly clutched her belly and started wailing. Her water broke, trickling down intermittently.

My father hurried to support her, shouting heartrendingly, "Doctor! We need a doctor! My daughter is in labor!"

Watching my sister being carried away on a stretcher, I exchanged a glance with Lucas and immediately clutched my own belly. "Oh no, I'm in labor too!"

Lucas pretended to panic and carried me in his arms, rushing me to the delivery room as well.

Two hours later, my father came to my hospital room carrying a swaddled infant.

He rudely ordered me, "You have everything. You should give up the position of the Gray family heir to your sister."

"You owe her this!"

I couldn't help but want to laugh. Back then, it was he who had an affair and fathered an illegitimate daughter, not daring to bring her home, making her suffer. How could this be blamed on me?

"What if I refuse?" I asked.

My father's gaze turned vicious as he gritted out a threat, "Then don't blame me!"

"Blame you for what?" My best friend pushed open the door, looking at my father's stunned figure with a half-smile. "Uncle, you really are a good father, staying by your daughter's side at a time like this."

After saying this, she quickly ushered in the bejeweled socialites behind her. "See, I told you Mrs. Gray was fine. It's just childbirth after all."

The wealthy ladies crowded into the room, each offering unique congratulations, their faces full of flattery.

One of them reached out to take the baby from my father's arms. "This must be the second Mrs. Gray's child, so quiet and well-behaved."

My father sneered and held the baby high. "This is Lily's child!"

The socialite kept smiling. "Miss Chen's child must be extraordinary."

"After all, Mr. Gray..."

As her eyes swept over the child, she suddenly screamed.

"What is this!"

"Why is it black!"

"Miss Chen! Whose child is this?!"
