In The Onyx Club, the most notorious venue in Veridian City, my younger sister lay sprawled on the central stage, disheveled, like a discarded toy.

Below the stage, men clutched blood-stained sheets, arguing fiercely.

"It was me last night! I was the one who took her virginity!"

"Bullshit! I was clearly the first one in!"

"Get lost! It was definitely me!"

Lily’s face was ashen, like fragile paper, her eyes fixed in disbelief on her fiancé, Julian Thorne, who sat at the VIP table.

"Julian, I'm your fiancée! How could you do this to me?"

Julian leaned in and kissed the lips of the delicate woman in his arms, his gaze turning chillingly cold as he looked at Lily.

"A woman who couldn't even keep track of who she slept with last night actually has the nerve to question me?"

The woman in his arms giggled, but her eyes held nothing but contempt as she looked at Lily.

I sat in a secluded booth, my gaze as sharp and cold as a blade.

Just three years since I was last in this city, and someone dared to scheme against the Hayes family?
