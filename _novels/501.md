My boyfriend Jason insisted on a platonic relationship, believing physical desire was sinful.

When I simply kissed him, he sent me away for "spiritual purification."

The purification was successful.

I no longer felt any desire for him.

But my desire for other men doubled.

Later, when he noticed the kiss marks on my collarbone, he started ranting in public again.

"Must you fall into the abyss of sin?!" he yelled.

His friend pulled me onto his lap and kissed my hand, laughing: "I've sinned. Why don't you call the police and arrest me?"

The day I graduated from the spiritual purification program, I gave a speech as an outstanding graduate in front of the other students and their families.

"I believe true love is the communion of souls. It shouldn't be bound by physical constraints or driven by desire..."

My boyfriend Jason was sitting in the audience.

I stared at his face, maintaining a polite smile, but inwardly I felt sick.

The reason I was standing here was all thanks to him.

Three months ago, we had kissed.

It was our first kiss.

He had pulled me into his arms, called my name with a drunken voice, and kissed me.

I didn't push him away.

After all, we had been dating for five years.

And he wasn't calling someone else's name when he kissed me.

But when he sobered up and realized it was me, his eyes instantly filled with disgust.

I was pushed to the ground.

Jason went to rinse his mouth.

I stood at the bathroom door, staring at his actions, my fingers gripping the doorframe tightly.

"Jason, was kissing me that disgusting?"

He looked up at my reflection in the mirror, his gaze ice cold.

"I've told you before, I'm platonic. I find this kind of intimate behavior repulsive."

"You were the one who kissed me," I softly retorted.

"Then why didn't you push me away?"

He pressed his palms on the counter, his fingertips turning white, sweeping everything onto the floor.

I froze for a moment, then turned and left.

I didn't answer him.

Because it was too absurd and laughable.

By the time he came out of the bathroom, I had already packed my things.

"Jason, let's break up."

He walked past me, giving me a casual glance.

He only said three words: "No need to."

"There is a need. I don't accept your platonic relationship. I want to have a normal relationship."

I looked at his back, enunciating each word: "A normal relationship. With sex."

As soon as those words left my mouth, Jason lost his mind.

I wasn't able to break up with him smoothly.

Instead, I was sent to a spiritual purification program abroad.

They promised that in just three months, they could purify my desires.

The students sent here were all young, beautiful girls.

Most of their partners were elderly rich men, or wealthy men with hidden ailments.

The so-called purification program was actually to prevent women dependent on men from cheating.

I was an anomaly here.

Because there was nothing wrong with Jason in that department.

When we kissed, I could feel his reaction.

He clearly had a physical response.

But every time I showed any desire for intimacy, even just watching TV together, it would make him furious.

Even on the day my mother passed away, Jason didn't show up.

I endured the funeral and memorial service alone, wanting to ask him for a comforting hug.

He still refused.

To avoid me, he even went out in the middle of the night.

The next day, I received an anonymous text message.

It was a photo of a woman sitting on Jason's lap.

Just thinking about it made me vomit in front of everyone.

Jason immediately stood up from the audience.
