In the dining room, Derek lifted Chloe by her butt and placed her on the long prep table.

Their breathing was ragged, and they entangled themselves passionately,

in no time at all, squashing the perfectly round, snowy-white wontons on the table into a crooked mess.

"Why did you go to all that trouble, pretending these wontons were homemade when you clearly ordered takeout? What's the point?"

"You don't understand, babe. Women fall for the effort. I want to make her happy, so Stella doesn't keep suspecting I don't love her anymore."

Chloe frowned, then turned her head, refusing his kiss.

"She gets to be pampered, and I don't?"

Derek tried to peck her lips several times but failed. Growing impatient, he pulled a black card from his pocket.

"Here, baby, take this card. Caviar, foie gras, black truffles – swipe it for whatever you want. Why would you bother with cheap takeout when you have this?"

"Besides, I'm doing this so we can spend more time together, you know? You have no idea how much I've wanted to try it in the kitchen."

Chloe took the black card with her teeth, finally satisfied.

She stopped resisting and instead reached for a jar of peanut butter, smiling meaningfully.

"Alright, tit for tat. My turn to treat you. I remember you love peanut butter. I bought this specially for you on the way here."

Then, she generously scooped out a large spoonful and suggestively dabbed it on her intimate areas.

Derek instantly became like a hungry wolf, his eyes turning red. He lunged and bit deeply into Chloe's neck.

Under his intense assault, Chloe squirmed uncontrollably.

The two of them left various marks all over the food on the table.

They were completely oblivious to when hair got mixed into the food.

Was this how all the meals I'd eaten all these years were made?

With a loud crash, Derek burst through the door, his face going pale the moment he saw my phone screen.

"Stella…"


"Where does it hurt? Is it serious?!"

A second before he burst in, I had already switched the monitor screen to my dialing interface.

My nails dug deep into my palms as I forced a smile, despite the discomfort.
