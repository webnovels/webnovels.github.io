I was about to sign the adoption papers for the sweet-faced girl when a blazing scarlet text overlay suddenly flashed across my vision.

[NO! The main character, Lily, is sweet, but she’s a total love-struck idiot! She wastes the entire family fortune for the male lead later!]

[Look at that gloomy little girl in the corner! That’s the future villainess, the Commercial Queen. She looks scary now, but give her a little love, and she’ll be the fiercest protector of the family!]

[Yes, yes, yes! Don’t pick Lily! Pick the villainess! I want to see the villainess defy her fate this time!]

My hand, clutching the pen, froze. I looked past the crowd and landed on the girl huddled in the corner, clutching her knees, her eyes sharp and guarded, like a young wolf.

I put down the pen and smiled at the director of the children’s home.

“I’ll take that child as well.”

1

The director, Ms. Hayes, was visibly startled by my decision. She followed my gaze and frowned.

“Rowan... she’s a bit unusual. A few families adopted her before, but they brought her back within a couple of days. They said she would stay awake all night, just staring at them. Said it was unsettling. Are you sure you don’t want to reconsider Lily?”

Lily was the sweet girl. Hearing her name, she blinked her big, innocent eyes up at me, undeniably endearing.

But the overlay on my vision went ballistic.

[Green Tea Alert! Lily is already putting on the poor-little-me act. In the original plot, she used this trick to get her adoptive mother to kick her own daughter out of the house!]

[Rowan is just suffering from a massive lack of security! She was on watch, protecting her new home! Those fools just didn't understand!]

I had made my decision.

So, this was a combined Fake Heiress meets Bad Boy CEO soap opera, was it?

I walked up to Rowan and crouched down.

She snapped her head up. Her eyes, stark black and white, were full of caution, like a small animal ready to bite.

“I’m not going with you,” her voice was a low rasp, carrying a chilling indifference that didn’t belong on a child her age.

I pulled a classic, red-wrapped Starburst from my jacket pocket, peeled back the paper, and held it out to her mouth.

“Come home with me. From now on, if anyone gives you a hard time, I’ll help you beat their ass. Including that little drama queen next to us.”

Rowan froze. She stared intensely at the candy, her throat moving slightly.

Next to us, Lily’s eyes welled up instantly at being called a “drama queen.”

The scarlet text went wild:

[HOLY MOLY! This Mom is a boss! I love her!]

[One sentence, two girls handled. This is the kind of mother a powerhouse female lead needs!]

I laughed, gently pushing the Starburst into Rowan's mouth. I also reached out and patted Lily’s head.

“What’s with the tears? You’re coming with me, too. My house needs a couple of noisy kids to fill it up.”

02

The adoption went smoothly. My husband, George—a man of few words but absolute obedience—and I held a hand each, leading the two vastly different girls back to our home.

We lived in a good-sized suburban house with a nice backyard.

“Wow! It’s a huge house!” Lily twirled around the entryway in excitement, a happy little butterfly.

Rowan, in contrast, stood silently at the door, gripping her worn backpack, her eyes warily taking in the surroundings.

The text overlay popped up again:

[Look at Rowan’s stress reaction. She must have endured so much. My heart is breaking.]

[Lily's adaptation skills are something else. But... she seems a little careless.]

I crouched down to help them with their shoes.

“This is your home now. There are two bedrooms upstairs with good light. You can pick one, or share?”

“I want the pink one!” Lily declared immediately, without hesitation.

Rowan pressed her lips together. “I don’t care. The storage room is fine.”

I frowned, reaching out to gently flick Rowan’s forehead.

“Don’t talk nonsense. No one sleeps in a storage room here. Since Lily picked pink, the blue one is yours. If you hate the color, we’ll call the contractors tomorrow and have it completely redone.”

Rowan covered her forehead, looking at me with disbelief.

It seemed no one had ever treated her with such “rudeness,” yet also with an odd, fierce affection.

That night, I purposely left the hallway light on.

When I got up for a drink of water later, I saw Rowan’s door slightly ajar.

Through the crack, I saw the small figure was not sleeping on the soft bed. She was curled up on the floor, hugging her blanket, facing the doorway. In her hand, she held a sharpened pencil.

A single, teary-eyed line floated into view:

[Waaah, she’s protecting herself, and she’s protecting this new home.]

I sighed. I pretended not to see, but as I walked past, I spoke loudly and deliberately:

“George, did you double-check the window locks and the doors? Our security system is directly linked to the precinct. Not even a fly could get in here.”

The small body in the room visibly relaxed.

03

Life quickly settled into a routine of controlled chaos.

Lily was sweet, affectionate, and easily charmed the neighbors.

Rowan, however, was a perpetual loner, her eyes shadowed. Neighbors privately called her “the odd girl.”

Until a month later, on a Saturday afternoon.

I was in the kitchen simmering a stew when a huge crash echoed from the living room.

Then came Lily’s heart-wrenching sobs.

I rushed out to see my favorite vintage Murano glass vase shattered on the floor. Lily sat amidst the fragments, crying hysterically, a small cut bleeding on her finger.

Rowan stood nearby, expressionless, holding a shard of glass.

“What happened?” I asked, my voice calm but firm.

The text overlay instantly exploded:

[It’s happening! The classic scene! In the original plot, the heroine broke the vase herself and blamed the anti-heroine, which led to the anti-heroine being grounded for three days, triggering her full villainess blackening!]

[Mom, you have to investigate thoroughly! Don't be fooled by Lily’s tears!]

My heart sank. I looked at Lily.

Lily choked out her words, pointing at Rowan: “It was… Rowan. She pushed me, and the vase fell… But I don’t blame her, Mom, please don’t scold her.”

A perfectly executed emotional maneuver.

I turned to Rowan. “Did you push her?”

Rowan squeezed her hand holding the shard, drawing a bead of blood. She scoffed coldly. “If I said no, would you believe me?”

The despair in her eyes suggested she already knew the answer.

I walked over, firmly took Rowan’s hand, pried her fingers open, and tossed the shard away.

I grabbed the first aid kit, put a bandage on Rowan’s palm first, and then one on Lily’s finger.

Only after that did I speak, slowly and deliberately:

“We have security cameras in the house. One is right next to the TV. It’s a 360-degree, no-blind-spot camera.”

The air thickened instantly.

Lily’s sobs cut off, her face turning pale.

Rowan suddenly looked up, a flicker of disbelief in her eyes.

In truth, the 'camera' was just a little ceramic ornament.

But the bluff was enough.

I looked at Lily, my tone serious. “I’ll give you one more chance. Tell me again, what happened?”

Lily trembled, lowering her head. “It was me… I was trying to reach the candy jar on the shelf and I accidentally knocked it over… I was afraid you would be mad at me…”

I sighed and gently touched Rowan’s head, feeling her entire body stiffen under my touch.

“Rowan, why didn’t you defend yourself just now?”

Rowan turned her face away, her voice muffled: “No one ever believes me anyway.”

“I do.”

I stated it definitively.

“In this house, if you say you didn’t do it, I believe you. But if I find out anyone is lying, the consequences will be much worse than a broken vase.”

That evening, for the first time, Rowan voluntarily sat on the living room sofa. She sat far away from me, but her eyes never left me.

The text overlay erupted in cheers:

[YES! Mom is mighty! Rowan’s emotional wall finally has a crack!]

[Lily's personality needs to be fixed, though. She’ll be a liability otherwise.]

04

To correct Lily’s habit of deflection and to help Rowan heal her inner wounds, I implemented a strict “Family Points System.”

Chores, high grades, and honesty earned points. Lying and shifting blame incurred double deductions.

Points could be redeemed for wishes.

At first, Lily struggled, often trying to use her charm to sneak by.

But I was immovable, even dragging George into an “Anti-Pity Party League.”

Rowan, conversely, became a point-hoarding machine.

She silently swept, did the dishes every night, and aced every test.

Six months later, Rowan approached me with a hard-earned one hundred points.

“I want to redeem a wish.”

“Tell me.”

She hesitated for a long time, then whispered, “I… I want to change the lock on my room to one that can be bolted from the inside.”

A pang of sadness hit me.

This child still carried so much fear.

“Granted. And not just the lock. I’m also getting you a full, enormous, architectural LEGO castle. How does that sound?”

Rowan’s eyes brightened. The corner of her mouth lifted in the smallest of smiles—her first since arriving.

It was fleeting, but like ice melting in spring, it was breathtaking.

As for Lily, after I deducted her points three times and she watched her favorite doll get locked away, she finally started to behave.

She clumsily began helping Rowan clean up, often doing more harm than good, but at least she stopped pushing the blame.

Once, I overheard the two girls whispering on the porch.

Lily: “Rowan, I can’t figure out this problem. Can you help me? I’ll use the points transfer function and give you half of mine.”

Rowan’s response was cold: “Who needs your points. Hand it over, you idiot. You still can’t figure this out?”

Despite the insulting tone, the sound of her explaining the steps didn’t stop.

Watching them, I felt an inexplicable urge to cry.

Who said the wicked stepsister and the sweet sister couldn't coexist peacefully?

They looked pretty harmonious to me.

05

Time flew by like a shooting star. Nine years passed in a blink.

Both girls were now in high school.

Rowan grew into a cool, untouchable ice queen, the undisputed academic goddess of the school, though her personality remained guarded.

Lily blossomed into a gorgeous, sweet-natured girl, the recognized campus beauty, constantly surrounded by fawning boys.

That evening at dinner, the text overlay began to flash a frantic warning.

[WARNING! WARNING! The male lead is about to show up!]

[The scumbag who makes Lily a love-struck idiot and ultimately bankrupts the whole family—Jax Remington—is transferring here!]

[Original plot: Jax first flirts with Rowan, finds her boring, then moves to Lily. The sisters turn against each other because of him. Rowan is pushed to villainy, and Lily runs off with him for love!]

The hand holding my chopsticks shook, nearly dropping the braised beef onto the table.

Jax Remington?

The legendary Scion of the Remington Group? Walking testosterone?

I took a deep breath, looking at my two daughters who were currently watching a celebrity gossip show together.

I absolutely would not let this one bad apple spoil the two perfect batches of stew I had lovingly raised!

I cleared my throat. “Ahem. I heard a new student is transferring to your school tomorrow?”

Lily chewed on her chopstick. “Oh, yeah. I heard he’s super hot and a total trust fund baby! The whole school is losing it.”

Rowan didn't look up. “Boring. I’d rather spend that time on two more physics problems.”

I nodded in approval, giving Rowan the largest piece of prime rib.

“Rowan is right. Men only slow down your sword. Especially the ones who are rich and handsome. They are usually just spoiled dirtbags.”

Lily pouted. “Mom, that’s such a generalization. What if it’s true love?”

I scoffed. “True love? Can true love pay the bills? Can it help you get into college? Can it buy you a house?”

Lily stuck out her tongue, not daring to argue.

But I knew that teenage hormonal surge wasn't something a few sentences could suppress.

06

To strictly monitor the situation, I decided to return to my old habits—volunteering at the school.

Under the guise of the PTA Booster Club, I set up several “eyes and ears” around campus.

The reports came in a few days later.

Jax Remington was indeed a troublemaker.

He immediately bought out the entire vending machine for the whole class, except for Rowan.

His reason? Rowan’s look of utter disdain bothered him.

On my way home that day, I hid in the car, watching the school entrance.

I saw a boy in a ridiculously modified school uniform, a backpack slung over one shoulder, blocking Lily’s path.

That signature smirk made my fists clench.

The text overlay was screaming:

[That’s the smirk! It’s cheesy, but it’s an absolute killer for a high school girl!]

[Lily is blushing! Oh no, oh no, the plot is starting!]

Jax leaned a hand on the wall, successfully pinning Lily.

“Hey, sweetcheeks. Heard you're the school beauty? How about being my girlfriend?”

Lily was clearly overwhelmed, frightened like a trapped rabbit, her face the color of a ripe apple.

“You… you need to move…”

“What if I don’t?” Jax leaned in closer.

Just as I was about to open the car door and charge out, a backpack came whistling through the air.

“THWACK!”

It landed with precise accuracy on the back of Jax’s head.

Jax stumbled, clutching his head and swearing, “Who the hell wants to die?”

Rowan stepped out from the shadows, her face cold. In her hand was a thick AP Calculus workbook.

She walked up to Lily and firmly pulled her behind her back.

“I’m her sister. You want to date her? Finish this textbook first. If your score is below 90% on the final test, you get lost.”

Jax laughed, enraged. “Who are you? Why are you trying to manage my life?”

Rowan’s eyes were arctic, looking at him like a piece of trash.

“I’m your worst nightmare.”

Silence descended upon the crowd.

Even I was stunned.

When did my quiet, study-focused, Ice Queen Rowan learn to drop mic-worthy insults?

The text overlay was a sea of WTFs.

[QUEEN! Take my knees!]

[This is the right way to play this! I ship this: Icy sister x Clumsy sister!]
