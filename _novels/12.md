The year I loved Jack Thompson the most was the year he died in a car accident.
Everyone thought I would break down, but I didn't cry or make a scene.
Two years later, I ran into him at a private party. Jack was passionately kissing a young woman.
His friends rushed to explain to me:
"Jack was severely injured in the accident and fell into a coma. He's just woken up and lost his memory... We didn't tell you to spare you from constant worry."
Jack pushed the girl away and came to me, frowning as he said:
"I heard you're my fiancée? Although I don't remember, I'll honor our engagement since you've been pining for me."
I smiled slightly and replied, "They're lying to you. We don't know each other."
Jack didn't know that on the day he faked his death, I had received a video.
In the video, Jack was laughing as he told someone:
"The thought of being with only Emily after marriage is unbearable.
"I'll fake my death and play around for a few more years. Comfort her often, don't let her do anything stupid."
He also didn't know that during the two years he was "dead,"
I had been with other men.
