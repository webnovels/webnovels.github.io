The day after my father died in that fiery truck crash, Mr. Beaumont—Owen’s father—set his sights on my mother. He didn't waste a minute.

To get her, that old bastard actually had his own wife, Evelyn, committed to an institution.

Owen and I wanted to tear each other apart. Yet there he was, forcing our hands together, spouting some garbage about how we were a family now, and we needed to take care of each other.

He didn't waste time proving what kind of family it was. He practically packaged me up and delivered me to an ancient, balding wreck of a man.

“Women,” he’d sneered, “are just a means to an end. It doesn’t matter who holds the leash.”

He was right. Which is why I chose to crawl into Owen Beaumont’s bed that night—and, more importantly, record every minute of it.

Owen hated me, but he had no choice but to protect me.

I hated him too, so every time he found a new sweetheart, I’d use that video to extort a fresh chunk of cash.

This time was no exception.

I could see him from across the velvet ropes, his arm wrapped around his new flame, kissing her like they were the last two people on earth. I lifted my phone, giving him an innocent, little wave.

My friend, unaware of the nuclear bomb I carried in my pocket, leaned in.

“Did you notice something?” she whispered, a little conspiratorially. “Your brother’s new girlfriend… doesn’t she look exactly like you when you were eighteen?”

I glanced over. The small, white flower nestled in his embrace did share a certain delicacy around the eyes with me.

But she, unlike the eighteen-year-old me, was clearly happy.

“Like me? I don’t think so,” I said, dismissing the thought with a small, brittle laugh. “His taste isn’t that good.”

I picked up my glass and walked toward him, plastering a sweet, compliant smile on my face.

“Hi, Owen. Your new girlfriend is gorgeous. Prettier than all the others.”

Owen’s lips were pressed into a thin, cautious line. He was braced, waiting for the inevitable bomb drop.

The girl—Sienna—didn’t catch the acid in my tone. She lowered her head, blushing with shyness.

“Owen, you have a sister? You never told me.”

I beamed, my smile wide and fake. “That’s right, Owen. Why don’t you introduce your lovely little sister?”

I pulled out my phone, pretending to search for something. “Sienna, have you seen pictures of my brother when he was a little kid? You know, naked? They’re adorable!”

Owen practically lunged, clapping his hand over my wrist. He forced a smile for Sienna. “Enough, Lily. Don’t scare Sienna.”

His eyes, however, were sharp and dangerous. He leaned in, whispering so only I could hear: “The money’s transferred. Now behave.”

Satisfied, I slipped the phone away and pouted dramatically at Sienna. “He gets shy when I talk about his past.”

I finished my drink and turned to leave, but he stopped me.

“Don’t go, Lily.”

He draped his arm around Sienna, a look of faux pride on his face. “This is my sister, Lily. Our father sent her to special dance academies from a young age. She won all the prizes. She’s phenomenal.”

The smile froze solid on my face. My fists clenched, my nails digging deep into my palms. He knew exactly what to say to draw blood.

The ‘dance academies’ were where the old man sent me to learn how to entertain his business partners. A specialized, overtly sensual routine designed for consumption. Owen knew how much I hated it.

If I hurt, he was happy.

Seeing my silence, Owen pulled a thick wad of cash from his jacket. “What’s wrong, little sister? Not enough incentive to perform?”

He put the cash in Sienna’s hand, patting her shoulder. “You ask her. Make her dance.”

“I…” Sienna held the money, completely bewildered. Owen took her hand, grabbed the cash, and threw the stack at me. The bills scattered across the floor.

“Not enough? Lily, you’re being greedy tonight.”

He wore a triumphant smile. I slowly crouched down, gathering the bills one by one, calmly tucking them into my small clutch. When I was finished, I looked up and extended a hand toward him.

“If your girl wants to see it, of course I’ll dance.”

“But this particular dance... it needs a partner.”

Owen’s brow furrowed. Before he could speak, I slid my hand past his face and offered it to the nearest stranger—a man I’d never seen before.

Maybe it was the alcohol, but I thought I saw a flicker of loss in Owen's eyes.

The performance was intimate and overtly seductive. By the time it was over, Sienna was staring, wide-eyed. My dance partner was flushed and eager. I linked my arm through his, waving at Owen. “Gotta run, big brother. Have fun.”

I’d barely settled into the man’s sedan when a huge fist slammed against the window. Before I could process it, Owen had yanked the door open and pulled me out.

“Lily Shen,” he spat, shoving me into his own black SUV. “You were actually going to leave with him? Huh?”

I hadn't even finished a curse before the driver hit the gas.

“Where are you taking me?! Pull over! I’m going home!”

He just grinned, a lazy, awful smile. “Home? What home? You don’t have a home, you damn leech!”

Smack!

My palm connected with his cheek. It was loud. He touched the red mark, and didn't even look angry.

“That’s all you’ve got? You must have skipped dinner; that was weaker than last time.”

I raised my hand again, but he caught my wrist, pinning it against the headrest. He leaned in, his body heat trapping me against the seat.

“What do you want to eat? Cake? Steak?” His hand slipped to my lower back. “Or me?”

Before I could answer, his mouth was on mine, urgent and demanding. It was a kiss that bordered on suffocation. I bit down, hard, drawing blood, but he only grew more frantic, trying to consume me whole.

The car stopped abruptly outside my condo building. Owen peeled himself off me, wiped his mouth, and waved me out.

“I need to go comfort Sienna now. Don’t want her getting scared if I’m gone too long.”

He sped away. I spat at the retreating taillights and then heard it: a wounded, whimpering sound from the bushes. A stray cat.

Without a second thought, I took it to the nearest animal ER. At the counter, stroking the cat's head, I felt the familiar, achy pity.

“Find a good, responsible owner for her. I’ll cover all the future medical bills and the neutering.”

The vet looked at me, confused. “Aren’t you taking her home?”

Home? I thought. What home?

It was nearly midnight when I finally got back to the complex.

This condo was the only thing I’d managed to rent without anyone knowing. Somehow, Owen found out. He didn’t just find out; he bought the place and handed me the deed.

But he had one requirement: he needed his fingerprint on the door lock.

I turned on the lights. The place was simple and cozy, but Owen was slowly colonizing it. A spare toothbrush, a pair of slippers—small, insidious tokens of his presence, eating away at my only private space.

I had barely fallen asleep when he returned.

He was cold when he slid under the covers. I pulled away instinctively.

“Ugh… get out…”

“Don’t move.” He burrowed his head into my neck, his breath heavy with liquor. “Lily… don’t move.”

It must have been the alcohol, but I thought I heard him whisper Sienna instead of Lily. And because I wasn’t sure, I didn’t kick him out.

He bolted awake the next morning, scrambling to get dressed like I was toxic waste. A childish, beaded shell bracelet dropped from his cuff.

I picked it up, dangling it. “Homemade? Wow, the new girl is pure.”

Owen snatched it back, pulling it onto his left wrist like it was a sacred relic. “Don’t touch her things,” he growled. “You’ll ruin them.”

A sudden, hot flash of rage—unnamed, useless—coiled in my stomach. I leaned up, kissed his cheek hard, and snapped a photo.

“Ten thousand,” I said, waving the phone, the practiced, shameless currency collector. “Your mouth is filthy, too. Ten thousand for my silence, a fair trade.”

He stared at me, jaw clenched tight.

“Lily Shen, is there anything you won’t do for money? Just like your mother!”

I met his stare, completely calm. “Yes. At least we get paid. Unlike…”

Unlike my father and your mother, one dead, one crazy.

I swallowed the words, along with the acidic taste of my own bitterness.

I hit his shoulder on the way past the door. “Get out. I’m sick of looking at your face.”

Owen left, and I went back to sleep. I had a long, heavy dream.

My father’s face was blurred in the memory. He was in the driver’s seat of his big rig, smiling bright. “My good girl, Lily. When I get back from this run, I’m taking you and your mother to the water park!”

I never made it to the water park. I only heard the news of his truck rolling over, his body consumed by fire. That charred corpse was a nightmare that still haunted me.

My phone woke me up. My eyes were still wet with tears.

“Who is it?”

“Is that Lily? This is Sienna... your brother's... girlfriend.” Her voice trailed off.

I was instantly awake. I met her at the coffee shop she suggested. She was frail and small in a white sundress, like a nervous field mouse.

“What do you want to talk about?” I already knew: she wanted to call me a slut and tell me to stay away from Owen. It had happened countless times before; I was used to it.

“I should probably call you 'Sister Lily,' shouldn’t I? I didn’t ask you to meet for any bad reason.” Her eyes were pure and unfocused. I was suddenly dizzy, like I was truly looking at the eighteen-year-old me.

“The two of you… your relationship is complicated, isn’t it?” Sienna’s voice was shaking. “I don’t know how deep it goes, I just hope you don’t mind my being here. I won’t interfere with anything you have with him. I just want to finish my degree. Owen promised to put me through college…”

I felt a brutal, cold shot to my heart. She thinks he’s her hero. I couldn't speak until the coffee was cold and Sienna was getting ready to leave.

“He’s garbage,” I said, calling her back. “He’s not worth it. You can finish school without him.”

That night, Owen was furious.

He burst into my condo, yanked his belt from his jeans, and tied my hands securely.

“What did you say to her?”

“She broke up with me! Lily Shen, have you completely lost your mind?!”

I didn’t resist. In fact, hearing the news gave me a flash of exhilarating pride.

I tilted my head and kissed his earlobe, smiling. “You’re trash, Owen. And trash belongs only with me.”

Desire ignited instantly. Owen poured all the frustrated emotion he'd been holding back from Sienna into me. By the time he carried me to the shower, it was late.

Through the white noise of the water, he muttered. “She reminds me of you when we first met.”

“But she’s obedient. She’s not stubborn like you.”

I pretended not to hear, tilting my head back to let the water wash over me.

A few days later, Owen staged a huge, over-the-top public display to win Sienna back. With everyone cheering them on, they embraced. Her pure white sundress stood out in the crowd.

I was watching the video on my date’s phone.

Elias Cole put his phone away and poured me another cup of tea. “Your brother looks serious this time.”

I didn't answer the observation; I just looked at Elias. “And you?”

Elias smiled, his eyes holding a calculated depth. “I can be serious too.”

The man extended his hand. “Pleasure doing business with you, Ms. Shen.”

The news of my impending engagement to Elias Cole quickly reached Owen. He came running to my place, only to find I’d changed the locks.

“Lily Shen, what the hell are you doing now?!”

“What’s up with Cole? How much did he pay you? Tell me!”

Sick of the noise, I ripped the door open and hurled his spare belongings at him. “How much did he pay me? Go ask your old bastard father!”

“Lily Shen!”

He grabbed my shoulders, his eyes blazing. He shook me, and a wave of nausea abruptly hit me. I turned and ran into the bathroom.

“What? Does the sight of me make you throw up now?!”

Owen suddenly froze. His expression went slack, and then he scrambled to leave. “Wait right there! Don’t move, you hear me!”

I stared at the counter. Three pregnancy tests lay side by side. Every single one had two lines.
