My wealthy wife would 'gift' me an investment property every time she spent the night at her male assistant's place.
Two years into our marriage, I held titles to 96 properties scattered across the city.
Each one a stark reminder of the 96 times she'd wounded me.
When the 97th property deed landed in my hands, her male assistant immediately sent me a taunting video.
"So what if Celeste gives you money? I have her heart, her very being. What good is being an international supermodel if you still can't even get your own wife into bed?"
I didn't stoop to his level. Instead, I thoughtfully mailed him a new, high-fashion outfit straight from the latest runway.
When my wife found out about my generous gift, she rewarded me by inviting me to an exclusive high-society party with her.
During a party game, her male assistant lost three times in a row and was dared to lick the cream off Cassie Vane's thigh.
He shattered a wine bottle, pressing the jagged edge to his throat, vowing not to comply. "Celeste, I refuse to let anyone humiliate me!"
My usually aloof wife instantly panicked. She pleaded with me to take the punishment for him.
"It's just licking some cream. I promise that after this, I'll go home and spend some quality time with you."
Everyone waited for me to make a fool of myself, but I quietly accepted without a fuss.
She didn't know this was the 97th time she'd hurt me.
And I no longer wanted to be her plaything. I was simply waiting to repay her kindness for saving me. Once that was done, we'd have nothing left between us.
