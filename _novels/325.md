"I lost a kidney, and then I died from an infection in the hospital.

My girlfriend was marrying my adopted brother in a fancy ceremony.

My mom couldn't get a hold of me and chewed me out for being inconsiderate.

""It's just a kidney. You gave it to your brother. Why are you so mad that you can't even come to the wedding?""

My sister glared at me, seething.

""I didn't think he'd be so bitter. It was Lindy who fell for Chris. He couldn't keep her, and now he's pulling a disappearing act.""

My usually quiet dad slammed his glass on the counter, shattering it.

""Fine, don't come. We'll pretend we never had such an ungrateful son. He was never a likeable kid anyway.""

""Yeah, let's just pretend he doesn't exist. We never really liked him.""

They… never really liked me?

Their words made my soul ache.

I wanted to vanish.

So, when I got a second chance, when my parents and sister told me I had to give everything to my adopted brother, I just nodded.

Give it to him.

Give him everything.

I don't want this biased family anymore.

This time, I just want to be healthy and live my own life."
