In the silent darkness, the creaking of Isabelle's iron bed in the next room was painfully distinct.

And her soft moans.

She should have been deep in sleep.

But now, she was immersed in physical pleasure.

It seemed the milk contained more than just a sedative.

And there were six other men outside.

The doctors had said these were our compatible matches.

I didn't know if all of them were meant to participate.

I blamed myself for not preparing Isabelle for this.

After a long, agonizing time, the sounds from Isabelle's room finally ceased.

Someone said something to the man, and he led Isabelle away.

Panic seized me. When Caleb finally unbound me, I asked him, "Where are you taking Isabelle?"

Caleb didn't answer directly, only saying, "Your current state will affect her. You'll meet again when the time is right."

I asked others, but no one answered me either.

Two months after we'd been transported here, Isabelle and I lost contact for the first time.


I was isolated.

Caleb, who had always been glued to my side, didn't appear.

The door was locked.

I picked up a chair and smashed it against the window, only to discover that the window was made of specialized glass, impenetrable to my strength.
