I snapped a photo at the high school reunion of my ex-boyfriend with his arm around his fiancée as they announced their engagement.
Just as I was about to hit send on a message to his mother saying "They look perfect together. Congratulations on getting what you wanted," my wrist was suddenly grabbed tightly.
"Oh, still in touch with my mom, are we?" Ethan glared at me, his expression dark. "What, didn't get enough money out of us yet?"
An eerie silence fell over the room. I looked up, my face pale.
The music had stopped at some point.
All eyes were on me.
