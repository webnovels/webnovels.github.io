I was meant to enter a marriage alliance with the Taylor Family alongside my best friend.

But on the eve of the celebration, I woke up in the bed of my best friend's fiancé.

Trying to flee, Liam Taylor revealed that it was all a plot by my boyfriend and best friend.

To prove it, he handed me a video of them entangled together.

"A doomed heir is only fit to be with a fool. Yet he dares to think he can marry the one I love."

"By tomorrow morning, Nora Bennett's affair scandal will be all over the headlines. They'll be tied together, and the entire Taylor Family will be ours."

It struck me that they had been together all along, and I was just a pawn in their scheme when I learned of the marriage alliance.

Their cruel intentions made all my sincere efforts seem like a joke.

In my rage, I sat on Liam Taylor and boldly declared, "You're mine now. You must marry me."

"I won't live past thirty-five. Are you sure you want to marry me?"

"Yes."

I nodded firmly, meeting his gaze, and kissed him to make him believe.
