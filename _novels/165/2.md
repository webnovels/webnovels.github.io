It turned out that a year ago, the accident injured not only Ethan Mitchell but also his arch-enemy, Nolan Johnson of the Johnson Family.

After that car accident, Nolan became a vegetative state.

Having endured a painful past life, I wouldn't casually use my blood to save people again, so I refused Mrs. Johnson's request.

Mrs. Johnson didn't press further and left in tears.

A week later, I received an invitation to a Mitchell Family banquet.

Fiona had returned with the Himalayan Snow Lotus. Mrs. Mitchell feared there might be issues with Fiona's medicine and asked me to attend and check it.

At the banquet, Fiona stayed close to Ethan.

Mrs. Mitchell held my hand, her face full of worry.

"I'm not afraid that Fiona's medicine won't work. I'm just worried that Ethan will be disappointed again and won't be able to handle the blow."

"We've tried everything in the past year. I've watched the hope in Ethan's eyes fade away bit by bit. As a mother, I really have no choice..."

Before I could offer comfort, Fiona pushed Ethan over.

"Aunt, don't worry. I can definitely help Ethan stand up. I almost died in the Rocky Mountains for this Himalayan Snow Lotus."

Ethan held Fiona's hand, looking deeply moved.

"Fiona, when I stand up, I'll throw you a grand wedding."

"Ethan, I believe in you."

Fiona turned to look at me, her smile ambiguous.

"I'm not like those fraudulent doctors. I'm confident I can heal Ethan's legs."

As soon as she finished speaking, the faces of the renowned doctors who had treated Ethan's legs turned sour.

"Miss Johnson, you speak boldly. Are you sure you can heal Mr. Mitchell's legs?"

"You're not even a medical professional, yet you dare to question our expertise?"

"Even Miss Smith from the medical family Smith Family said Mr. Mitchell's legs couldn't be healed. I don't believe a young girl like you has that ability!"

Although Ethan felt Fiona spoke rashly, he still defended her.

"I believe Fiona can heal me!"

I couldn't help but laugh.

Fiona thought I was mocking her.

She gritted her teeth in anger but forced a smile.

"Miss Smith, I heard you're the most outstanding doctor of your generation in the Smith Family. But you refused the Mitchell Family and then the Johnson Family. It's hard not to suspect you can't actually treat illnesses."

I smiled slightly.

"Then I'm very much looking forward to the day Miss Johnson makes Mr. Mitchell stand."

Seeing me laugh instead of getting angry, Fiona bit her lip.

"Are you upset I stole your thunder? I know Aunt favors you and wants you to marry Ethan. But now, only I can heal Ethan's legs."

Sitting in the wheelchair, Ethan sneered.

"Lydia Smith, even if you could heal me, I wouldn't agree to marry you. Moreover, you're just a fraud. When my mom introduced you, I thought you were someone impressive, but it seems you're just so-so."

"Let me tell you, the only person I love is Fiona, and I will marry no one but her."

"No matter how many times you appear before me, I won't spare you a glance."

Watching them act in sync, I just felt annoyed.

"Mrs. Mitchell invited me to check Miss Johnson's medicine. Since Mr. Mitchell trusts Miss Johnson so much, I won't meddle."

After saying this, I wanted to leave, but Fiona blocked my way.

"Lydia Smith, what do you mean by that?"

I frowned.

"Exactly what I said. If you don't understand, look it up in a dictionary!"

Fiona snorted coldly.

"Lydia Smith, do you dare to bet with me? Bet on who can heal Ethan's legs. The loser must kneel and admit defeat and never set foot in New York City again!"

I paused, turned to her.

"I'll bet with you, but I won't treat Ethan Mitchell. I'll treat Nolan Johnson!"
