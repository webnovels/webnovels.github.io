However, William's methods of torturing me weren't very sophisticated, nothing more than nitpicking.
He would only drink coffee after it had been brewed eight times, and would throw a fit if the bath water was one degree too low.
Once I showed any dissatisfaction, I couldn't sleep at night.
I already had sensitive skin, and even slight pressure would leave bruises.
William never showed mercy because of this, often indulging as much as he pleased.
Once when I was sick, I went to the hospital for IV drips for two days. On my way back, I happened to meet a senior from school.
He walked me to my doorstep and chatted with me casually for a bit.
It just so happened that William had returned from a business trip and saw this scene.
"I still have a fever. Can you let me rest for a while?"
I didn't know why he suddenly got angry, I just hoped that he would spare me this once, considering our years of friendship.
"You can still chat and laugh with others, so you probably don't need rest."
"Besides, 39 degrees (Celsius), I haven't tried it before. Want to give it a try?"
Beast.
I cursed at him, deliberately provoking him, but tears fell silently.
William turned my face back to him, his thumb gently wiping the blood from my bitten lip.
"Don't act like you've suffered some great injustice. At worst, you can go splurge with my card tomorrow to vent."
"After all, exchanging your body for benefits is something your family has always been good at."
I glared at William.
Hitting my sore spot made him unusually happy, the smile on his face carrying a hint of ferocious pleasure.
"Otherwise, why do you think my dad took care of your family for no reason?"
My strength suddenly drained away.
Because on this point, I had no way to refute.
The occasional candies, the cash gifts during holidays.
They had already become things that made me feel guilty whenever I thought about them, without me even knowing.
After it ended, I had a fever for three more days, taking care of myself alone in the guest room.
William, separated by just a wall, only threw over a box of fever reducers on the first day.
He said: "Olivia, don't die in my house. It's unlucky."
