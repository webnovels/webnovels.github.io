"Aren't you happy now that I'm dead and you can marry her?" I floated beside William at the wedding venue.
He couldn't hear me, of course. He just frowned, having his assistant Sarah repeatedly dial my number.
Two calls went unanswered.
The third time, the phone was turned off.
Ten minutes later, he lost his patience.
He took out his phone and sent me a few text messages, full of mockery and threats:
"You didn't come on my big day. What, you don't want to see me marry another woman?"
"Or do you think I'll give in if you throw a tantrum?"
"Olivia, I'll say this one last time. If you don't show up today, don't ever think about coming back."
When talking to me, he always had this air of absolute authority, as if he held the power of life and death.
Unfortunately, no matter how angry he was now, he couldn't take it out on me anymore.
Because a few hours ago, I had died.
"Mr. Song, the wedding is about to start. You should go change," Sarah reminded him, holding a tablet, her posture upright and respectful.
Hearing this, William's hand paused on the screen, his sharp brows furrowing.
After a few seconds, he tossed the phone to Sarah:
"Keep calling until she picks up."
