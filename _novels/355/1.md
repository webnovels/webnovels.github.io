My heart turned to ice as I listened to their conversation.
Just this morning, Lucas had bent me over his desk and taken me three times.
"We can't, there are cameras in your office," I had protested.
"Don't worry, I disabled them all. I can't let anyone else see how beautiful you are, my darling."
I had scanned the room carefully, only agreeing after triple-checking there were no cameras.
Now my shoulders still bore the marks of his passion.
So he had been lying to me all along.
The contract papers scattered across the floor.
Their conversation continued in the office.
"Lucas, you sly dog. Setting up that incident at the bar, having your guys harass her so you could swoop in and play hero. No wonder she fell for you hook, line and sinker."
"The Sinclairs and Grays have been rivals for years. When Olivia first joined the board and snatched that million-dollar deal from you, you became the laughingstock of the whole city."
"Now once you release that video at her birthday party, Olivia and the whole Sinclair family will be the new joke in town. You'll have crushed them completely."
"Who'd want to do business with that slut Olivia after that?"
...
I couldn't bear to hear any more.
So the love I thought was real was just an elaborate scheme.
But Lucas, you've underestimated me.
I may have loved the wrong man, but I can take the loss.
If you don't love me, there's a line of men waiting to love me instead.
Ethan's voice came through the phone: "Really? You're finally willing?"
"But I thought you said you were announcing your engagement next week? That you loved him..."
"That man will be you," I said firmly.
"What?"
I repeated with conviction: "That man is you."
I hung up and returned to my own company.
I called my assistant in. "Remember that contract I had you working on this month? I need you to draft a new proposal, but change the partner to Morgan Corp."
My assistant hesitated. "But weren't you and Mr. Gray very close? This deal would give them at least 30% profit. Why give it to the Morgans instead?"
"You've been working overtime for a month to make this happen. Why..."
"That's enough," I cut her off. "Personal feelings have no place in business. Besides, Morgan's offer is lower and they've been a trusted partner for 10 years. They deserve it."
"And remember, from now on Lucas Gray and I have no relationship whatsoever. Don't mention him to me again."
After dismissing my assistant, their conversation echoed in my mind.
I scrawled "VIDEO" on a piece of paper in frustration.
Video. I needed to delete any compromising footage before I left.
Just then, Lucas burst through the door.
His assistant followed, carrying gift boxes. Lucas took out a cake.
"I picked four flavors I think you'll love. Try them! Whichever you like best, I'll have them cater your birthday dessert bar."
I forced a polite smile. "Aren't you very busy lately? Why bother with little things like this?"
He fed me a spoonful. "Olivia, everything about you is important to me. No detail is too small. Oh, and your birthday is in a week - I've decided to plan the whole thing myself."
His gaze suddenly fell on the paper with "VIDEO" written on it.
My heart skipped a beat in panic.
He smiled, pointing at the word. "We should prepare a special video for your birthday party. Don't worry, I'll make sure it's a surprise you'll love."
Hearing this, my heart plummeted. The cake in my mouth turned bitter.
I spoke hoarsely: "It's just a birthday. We don't need a video, right?"
He stroked my hair affectionately. "No way, how else will your parents see how in love we are? How can they feel comfortable entrusting you to me?"
The last shred of hope in my heart was crushed by Lucas' own hand.
I nodded helplessly, my chest aching. "Whatever you say."
