That night, I watched his sleeping face and quietly took his phone.
I had once heard a married friend describe how she caught her husband cheating.
I learned that some phones have two separate interfaces, requiring a special method to switch between them.
I entered the password and successfully found the hidden interface using my friend's technique.
But opening the private space required another password. I tried the phone's unlock code - no luck.
I thought about using his fingerprint, but Lucas was very sensitive to touch. I didn't dare risk it.
As a last attempt, I entered my birthday. I had no real hope, but to my shock it worked.
Lucas, if you don't love me, why use my birthday as your password?
I wiped away tears and opened the hidden space like Pandora's box.
I found the pink cartoon avatar in the messaging app, and 1.5GB of videos of me stored in the cloud drive.
All our intimate moments that I thought were precious now felt like knives stabbing into me.
My trembling fingers checked the camera angle of one video. It seemed to be from a hidden camera on his body.
I quickly and permanently deleted all the videos, triple checking I hadn't missed any.
I put down the phone and found the diamond pin Lucas always wore.
On the back of the pin, I truly did find a tiny hidden camera.
I covered my mouth and collapsed to the floor, muffling my sobs.
Crying, I flushed the camera down the toilet.
The next day I packed all my things into a suitcase.
Lucas looked at me in confusion. "What's wrong? Where are you going?"
I smiled and replied: "I have a business trip in a few days. I'm packing early so I'm not rushed later."
Lucas came over and hugged me. "What's the hurry? I'll help you pack when it's time."
"Are you going to the office today? I'll drive you."
I pushed Lucas away. "I have a client meeting. I'll go myself."
Before I left, there was one last thing to take care of - handing over my work at the company.
My parents had wanted me to return to headquarters last year, but I had made excuses to stay with Lucas until now.
When I called yesterday saying I was ready to go back, they immediately sent a new manager to take over for me.
I had just finished briefing him on all the tasks when my assistant burst in. "Ms. Sinclair, there's trouble! A Miss Lee is making a huge scene, demanding to see you. She's saying..."
She hesitated, looking at me uncertainly.
"She's saying you're the other woman who stole her fiancé. Of course we don't believe her, but she won't leave. What should we do?"
I took a deep breath. So Emma Lee couldn't wait and came looking for me herself.
I walked out and heard the commotion by reception. "Olivia Sinclair, come out! If you have the guts to steal someone's man, have the guts to face me!"
Everyone was staring and whispering.
I stood in front of her. "You're looking for me? Let's talk in my office."
She strutted after me in her Chanel heels, bristling with anger.
She looked around my office, eyeing my nameplate. "So the homewrecker even made it to CEO. Did you sleep your way to the top?"
I leaned against my desk, turning the nameplate. "Miss Lee, you've been out of the country for over a decade and seem unfamiliar with things here. If you had bothered to look into the Sinclair family at all, you'd know exactly who I am."
Her eyes widened in disbelief. "You're Olivia Sinclair, the Sinclair heiress? Impossible. Lucas said the Sinclair daughter was his most hated rival - a shrew always meddling in men's business."
She narrowed her eyes, looking triumphant. "Oh, I get it. Lucas must be pretending to date you just to humiliate you."
"Take my advice and stop chasing after Lucas if you know what's good for you. We've been engaged since childhood. You don't stand a chance!"
I struggled to contain my anger, feigning nonchalance. "Oh? Why don't you ask your dear Lucas whether I'm chasing him, or he's chasing me."
When we first got together, he had pursued me relentlessly. Now I'm the other woman?
Lucas, you've really outdone yourself!
Just then, she flew into a rage and grabbed a nearby vase, hurling it at me.
"You're lying! Lucas would never like an old hag like you!"
I couldn't dodge in time. Blood spilled across the floor.
By the time Lucas rushed to the hospital, Emma had long since fled.
He stood by my hospital bed, looking guilty. "I'm so sorry. Emma is my sister - she's been spoiled by our family. It's my fault for not explaining things clearly. Don't worry, I've already scolded her."
I turned away, not wanting to look at him. He grabbed a water glass and smashed it against his own head.
Blood streamed down his face as he gazed at me with devotion. "See? Now we match. If you hurt, I'll hurt with you."
Seeing my silence, he raised the glass to strike himself again.
"If you're still not satisfied, I can do it again. Two times, three times, four times - as many as it takes until you forgive me."
I quickly stopped him. "Enough. Don't hurt yourself anymore."
He knelt down, reverently kissing my fingertips. "You've finally forgiven me?"
I nodded. Lucas, I'll believe you one last time.
