Just then, Lucas' phone chimed.
He glanced at the screen, a faint smile appearing.
I tilted my head to look, pouting playfully. "Who's messaging you?"
He hastily hid his phone. "It's nothing, just my assistant reminding me about a meeting."
My eyes darkened. He never used to hide things from me before.
I had clearly seen a pink cartoon avatar. Lucas had replaced all his assistants with men to avoid making me jealous.
Which woman was making him smile like that? Was it his fiancée Emma?
I hid my disappointment, watching him carefully.
Noticing my gaze, he broke into a sweat.
The phone rang again. He declined the call.
He gave me an apologetic look. "I'm sorry Olivia, I have to go. I'll come see you tonight after I'm done with work."
After Lucas left, I borrowed my assistant's car and discreetly followed him.
My heart raced. I wasn't sure what exactly I was trying to confirm.
At the airport, I donned sunglasses and a hat, trailing about 100 meters behind Lucas.
I saw him take out a large bouquet of pink and white flowers, looking around anxiously.
Soon I spotted a slender young woman in a white pleated skirt bouncing over.
She took the flowers and kissed him passionately right there in the airport.
I turned away abruptly, my nails digging into my palms.
I told myself: "Olivia, stop hoping. Your true love was just a game. It's time to quit."
Late that night, Lucas finally came home.
When we first moved in together, I wasn't used to Lucas getting home late from business dinners.
I always went to bed at 10pm sharp and woke up at 5:30am to work out for an hour before heading to the office, like clockwork.
He'd come home late and try to fool around, leaving me exhausted for my morning meetings.
After I complained repeatedly, he promised to always be home by 9pm.
Tonight was the first time he had broken that promise.
Seeming to sense my mood, he was especially gentle tonight.
He silently took my hand from under the covers and clasped a diamond bracelet around my wrist.
Then he bent to kiss my fingertips. "Look, do you like the new gift I chose for you?"
"I didn't mean to be late, I swear. We had an important client today. I knew you'd be upset so I had my assistant go to the auction to get this bracelet you loved."
"Will you forgive me just this once?"
The diamond bracelet sparkled dazzlingly in the dim light, impossible to look away from.
But I felt somewhat weary of it all.
I looked at him and said flatly: "You smell like iris perfume. Were you meeting a client or seeing a woman?"
He blanched in shock, quickly sniffing his jacket. "The client today was a woman, but she was over 40. No one as beautiful as you."
"Olivia, you're overthinking again."
Whenever he did something wrong and was trying to appease me, he'd call me "Liv" and pepper light kisses on my nose, collarbone, and stomach until I lost all resistance and surrendered to passion.
This time I pulled away. "But my employee saw you at the airport picking up a young, beautiful woman. You even kissed."
His expression cycled through several emotions in the lamplight, more colorful than a painter's palette.
He swore to the heavens: "We didn't kiss, it was just a cheek greeting. The client just got back from France, it's a local custom there. Don't overthink it."
"We're announcing our relationship in a week, what are you worried about?"
"Honey, are you having some pre-wedding jitters? You never used to be so insecure."
I looked at the man before me, still so composed even when caught in a lie.
I gritted my teeth. How lovely!
I stared at the phone in his pocket. "I don't believe you. Tell me your phone password, I want to check myself."
He calmly handed me his phone.
Then he entered the password in front of me. I checked his messages, social media, photos - nothing suspicious.
I couldn't even find that pink cartoon avatar.
For a moment I wondered if I had imagined the whole airport scene.
I handed the phone back, my voice choked. "I'm sorry, I must be oversensitive."
He smiled and took the phone back, his warm hand sliding up my calf.
I pulled my leg away, clutching the covers. "I was going to say, my period came early. The mood swings are probably from PMS."
He immediately placed a concerned hand on my belly and went downstairs to make me herbal tea.
I used to get bad cramps during my period. He took me to see a Chinese doctor who recommended an herbal tea. Ever since, he'd brew it himself each time, watching me drink it and giving me a sweet date to chase away the bitterness.
I watched his busy figure, unsure what was real and what was fake about this man anymore.
