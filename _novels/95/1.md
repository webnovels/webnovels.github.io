"Rachel, even though you're William's wife, we don't have any extra equipment for rescue operations now," said Kevin, William's colleague and the Blue Ocean Rescue Team's duty dispatcher, as he held my sleeve.

Due to interference with mobile phone signals at sea, my daughter contacted me through the emergency walkie-talkie I had slipped into her backpack that morning after the ship encountered danger.

Unable to locate the exact position, calling the police was useless.

After being reborn, I immediately ran five red lights to finally reach the rescue team headquarters.

But after explaining the situation, he blocked us outside the door.

My daughter kept crying on the other end of the walkie-talkie. At this moment, the children, including my daughter, must be terrified.

My father, hearing the crying, was on the verge of a heart attack. He pointed at the helicopter not far away.

"How is that possible? There's still a helicopter right there. Young man, hurry up and go find the children!"

Kevin scratched his head and sighed, "Old man, I understand how you feel, but that helicopter can't be used."

My father became agitated and grabbed Kevin's hand, "What's with all these rules? Saving lives is urgent now. My granddaughter is stranded at sea. You have the ability but refuse to save her. Where's your conscience?"

"Why are you yelling at me!" Kevin pushed my father, making him stumble. Then he said coldly, "You think flying a helicopter is as simple as strolling through a market? Besides, there are so many people who need help now. Why should we follow your orders just because you showed up?"

After berating my father, Kevin turned to me, "Rachel, I'm giving you face because of William. If this old man keeps making unreasonable demands, don't blame me for having you thrown out!"

Seeing the argument here, a crowd of passersby gathered at the rescue team's entrance.

Hearing his words, they all showed mocking expressions.

"These young men are busy day and night, sometimes they can't even eat before going to save people."

"Not appreciating how hard they work and causing trouble here. Is the rescue team exclusively for your family?"

The onlookers pointed and commented on us. My daughter's crying came through the walkie-talkie again.

"Mom, Grandpa, when can you come save me? I'm so scared!"

Hearing that childish voice trembling with fear, my heart felt like it was hit by a heavy hammer.

But even so, Kevin remained indifferent, looking at us askance and starting to smoke.

My father quickly forced a smile and apologized to Kevin, "Kevin, I'm sorry for speaking rudely earlier. Please hurry and start the helicopter to find my granddaughter. She's in real danger now!"

My father had put aside his dignity. A man nearly sixty with graying hair was now begging someone several decades younger than him.

But Kevin just glanced at my father, blowing smoke in his face and saying leisurely, "Begging won't help. There are regulations."

My father was on the verge of collapse, almost fainting on the spot. Luckily, I caught him.

I took out some blood pressure medication and helped my father take it. Then I looked up at Kevin.

"Kevin, you heard the walkie-talkie earlier. My daughter is in danger. If something happens to the child because of your negligence, can you bear the responsibility?"

Perhaps realizing he might be held accountable if something went wrong, Kevin put away his previous arrogant attitude.

Just when I thought he was going to arrange a rescue, he suddenly laughed.

"Rachel, who are you trying to scare? Even a three-year-old knows there are no reefs near Blue Ocean City's waters. You should have done better research before lying."

Then he looked at me with contempt and continued, "At first, when William said you would stop at nothing, I thought it was impossible. Now I've seen it for myself."

"You're deliberately obstructing William from rescuing Lucy, wanting to divert the helicopter. To win in a jealous fight, you even use your child to lie. How can your heart be so vicious!"

After saying this, Kevin spat at my feet.

Having lived through this once before, I naturally knew how urgent my daughter's situation was. Seeing that he was determined not to save people, I pushed him aside and ran straight to the dispatch room.
