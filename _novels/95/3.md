Hearing my daughter's cry for help, mixed with the sound of rushing water and screams, I quickly picked up the walkie-talkie.

At this moment, I absolutely couldn't panic. I had to stay calm.

So I put on a composed face and pressed the talk button.

"Lily, don't cry now, stay calm. Look under the seats, there should be an orange bag with a life jacket inside."

There was a rustling sound of searching, then my daughter's excited voice came through the walkie-talkie.

"Mom, I found it."

I took a deep breath and continued.

"Now put it on, then go find the crew member to take you to a safe place."

As I was guiding my daughter on how to survive, my father knelt directly in front of the dispatcher and begged: "Please, are you really going to stand by and watch them die?"

The onlookers looked at each other, and the dispatcher clearly wanted to contact his colleagues again, but was stopped by Kevin.

"It's fine, just keep watching them act!"

My daughter's voice sounded through the walkie-talkie again.

"Mom... the crew member went down to the engine room and never came back up..."

Hearing this, my heart tightened and I almost fainted.

But I quickly regained my composure, my brain working at high speed, and I responded in an encouraging tone.

"Lily, you're a brave big girl now. Put on the life jacket, then lead the other children to the highest point of the ship."

After about two minutes, my daughter's voice reporting safety came through.

"Mom, I've safely reached the crow's nest with the other kids."

Hearing this, tears streamed down my face uncontrollably, but I still maintained emotional stability as I answered my daughter.

"You did very well. Now quietly wait for rescue."

After a while, my daughter's childish voice came through again.

"I comforted the other kids saying my dad is the best lifeguard. They all stopped crying when they heard that."

"But Lily still hasn't seen Dad appear. Mom... is he not coming?"

My daughter's innocent voice echoed at the dispatch room door. Everyone around fell silent after hearing it, many lowering their heads and wiping away tears.

A woman spoke up, "How does this not seem like an act?"

Others chimed in, "Yeah, children don't lie. Hurry up and save them!"

Seeing so many people urging action, Kevin remained unmoved, looking at me with contempt.

"Hmph, this is obviously rehearsed beforehand. Rachel, you're wasting your talents not being a director!"

"But too bad, William has already left to save Lucy. Your carefully prepared sob story was all for nothing!"

Just then, a roar came from outside as the helicopter took off.

With that, the last hope in my heart was extinguished. I rushed at Kevin, scratching his face and screaming hoarsely.

"Kevin, you bastard, give me back my daughter! You can insult me and my father all you want!"

"But Lily is only eight years old. What did she do wrong? Why are you working with William to push her to her death, you murderers!"

Seeing me cry uncontrollably, the people around also became indignant. Just as they were about to beat Kevin, he quickly took out his phone.

"William, Rachel is causing a huge scene. Come back quickly!"

But William's irritated voice came through the phone.

"I'm going to save your sister-in-law now and don't have time. No matter what, you must stop that crazy woman for me!"

Hearing these two pronouns, my heart completely died.

The "sister-in-law" referred to Lucy, while the "crazy woman" clearly meant me.

At this moment, I couldn't hold back anymore. I grabbed the phone and shouted at the other end, "William, are you even human? Lily needs you now, but you're ignoring her danger!"

"I have nothing to say if you have a grudge against me. I've endured you wanting to get back with Lucy. But don't forget, Lily is your own flesh and blood!"

William's voice on the other end was indifferent.

"It doesn't matter. No one is more important than Lucy right now. As for Lily? Heh..."

His next words completely chilled my heart.

"I'll just consider her a bastard child I had with a dog!" Then the line went dead.

Kevin snatched back the phone with a schadenfreude expression.

"Did you hear that? Your little act is over. Now get out immediately and stop interfering with our work!"

Just then, Captain Chris suddenly rushed down the stairs in full rescue gear with several team members.

I immediately went up to him, "Captain Chris, Lily is stranded at sea now. Please have mercy and save my daughter!"

After hearing this, Captain Chris frowned and said, "Don't worry, I understand the situation."

Kevin also immediately came forward to play the victim.

"Captain, this crazy woman has been causing trouble here..."

But before Kevin could finish, Captain Chris slapped him across the face, sending him flying back and crashing into a desk.

Then Captain Chris ordered the team members beside him: "Notify the dock to prepare speedboats. Everyone put on gear and head to the incident area immediately!"

He then coldly looked at the dumbfounded Kevin and roared.

"I don't have a disciple like you, you piece of shit. If anything happens to the children, I'll skin you alive when I get back!"
