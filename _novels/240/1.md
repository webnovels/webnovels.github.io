Chapter 1

My husband got a flirty text from my "BFF."

She totally underestimated the bond Mark and I have.

Little does she know, every text she's sent Mark? It's been me replying the whole time.

1.

Mark was in the shower, his phone chilling on the couch.

Ding! A notification lit up the screen.

Curiosity got the better of me, so I unlocked his phone and peeked.

Friend request.

The sender? This chick who's suddenly been all over me the last few weeks, pretending to be my new bestie.

The request note was short and sweet, too.

"Hey! I work with Ashley and we're super close. It's Carol."

Huh? I never gave Carol Mark's handle. How did she even find him?

Curiosity officially piqued, I hit "Accept."

A message popped up instantly.

Carol: Hey Mark! Ashley's told me so much about you. I think we met when you picked her up after work the other day?

And an emoji wink, just for good measure.

I don't know what came over me, but instead of outing myself, I played along, answering her as Mark.

Mark: Vaguely. What's up?

Carol: Lol, nothing much. Just playing Truth or Dare with the girls and I lost! Had to add you, haha. Hope you don't mind 😉

Then, a selfie. Her cheeks were flushed, eyes glazed over – definitely tipsy. A few other blurry girls were visible in the background, along with booze and dice on a table.

I frowned. Was Carol being shady, or was it just harmless fun?

We chatted a bit more, and something felt...off.

She was way too comfortable, like she was trying to reel him in on purpose.

Suddenly, the bathroom door swung open.

2.

Mark strolled out, toweling off his hair.

Just a towel wrapped around his waist, all steamy and fresh from the shower.

Even though I'm used to it, I can't help but think my man is fine.

He flashed me a grin, and I had to admit, my husband's a hottie.

He came over, leaned down, all innocent puppy-dog eyes. He knows that's my weakness.

"Hey babe, all clean. So, are we heading to bed?"

I playfully turned away, dodging his breath, and waved his phone at him.

"Explain this."

He grabbed the phone, read through the texts, and looked completely lost.

"Who is this person? I wouldn't recognize her if she bit me! Baby, you gotta trust me. My wife is a ten, why would I look at anyone else? If she's bugging you, I'll block her right now."

He reached for the phone, ready to delete her.

When I shook my head, he didn't push it, just snuggled up to me like a big teddy bear.

I couldn't help but giggle.

Seeing me smile, he got even more bold, wrapping his arms around me. Classic Mark.

But this wasn't over yet, and I wasn't letting it go that easily.

I couldn't decide if Carol was deliberately trying to stir something up, or if she really was just playing a silly game.

But adding someone's husband on a dare? That wasn't exactly normal behavior.

If she was innocent, deleting her would make me look insecure.

And if she was up to something, she'd just find another way to get to him. Better to keep her close and see what her game was.

After a bit more back-and-forth, Mark came up with a plan.

He had two numbers anyway – one for work, one for friends and family.

Carol had added his personal number, so he'd just stop using it for a few days. I could log in on my phone and handle any legit messages.

Seeing how open he was, I agreed.

Problem solved, he gave me that pleading look again.

If he had a tail, it would be wagging like crazy. Loyal husband material, right there.

"So, can I tempt you back to the bedroom now?"

I pretended to think it over, and when he started to look worried, I finally smiled.

"Okay, you twisted my arm."

3.

The next day at work, Carol greeted me with the same sugary sweetness, playing the perfect girlfriend.

I returned the sentiment without revealing my true intentions, and there was a strange harmony between us.

After a while, just as my work was getting better, my phone vibrated.

I opened it and saw a message on Mark's personal number.

It was from Carol.

Carol: Photo.jpg

It was a photo of me changing the water cooler bottle in the office - and I looked awful!

Carol: Ashley's so strong 💪 Does she boss you around at home? 😂

With an emoji laughing face.

I glanced at Carol.

She had a smile on her face, staring at her phone, waiting for a reply.

So angry, I forwarded the photo to Mark's work number.

Mark replied very quickly.

Mark: My wife's beautiful!

Ashley: When did you go blind?

Mark: Even if you are my wife, you can't say that about her!

... Okay, can't talk to this man, I'll reply to Carol myself.

Mark: It's just a water change, it's alright.

Carol: I'm so jealous of Ashley! Her husband is so good to her!

Carol: Unlike me, I can't even move the water bottle. I should work out some more, oh well...

I was a bit disgusted, I could feel her coquettishness through the screen.

You little green tea b*tch, you dare talk behind my back to my husband!

Thinking about this, I was a little angry and wanted to break up with her directly.

But then I thought about it again, with just a few chat records, I was afraid that no one would believe me if I talked about it, but it would easily give her an opportunity to fight back.

I should hang out with her first, and if she can give up despite the difficulties, I don't want to embarrass her.

If she insisted on taking her own humiliation, then I could only let her know that coveting someone else's husband was a very unkind character.

I said a few perfunctory words to her, but she didn't notice my perfunctory remarks at all.

I sent a message to ask my husband if he wanted to have dinner together.

Of course, for "their" first dinner together, she had to bring me along.

What a coincidence, my husband said last night that he would pick me up from work today and go out for dinner together.

After hesitating for a while, I agreed to her dinner invitation.

I also told my husband that the dinner for two had become a three-person trip.

My husband expressed his great displeasure about this.

In order to get him to agree, I promised him to make up for the date with him next time, and I would never break the appointment.

After saying a lot of nice things, I got his smile.

4.

After work, Carol took my hand and, as expected, asked me to have dinner together.

Walking to the gate of the company, my husband Mark was already waiting.

I looked over from afar, he had one hand in his pocket and was leaning against the door of the Mercedes G, which all scumbags loved.

With a height of 6 feet, a high nose bridge, and light eyebrows, he had an intimidating presence.

When he wasn't smiling, he was quite imposing, and it's no wonder people always wanted to attract his attention one after another.

Before I could speak, Carol beside me shouted out in surprise.

"Mark, over here, over here!"

I couldn't help frowning.

Mark? She called my husband so affectionately.

Mark looked over after hearing the sound, and at the moment when his eyes met mine, the ice and snow on his face melted away, and he raised a warm smile, and at the same time walked quickly towards me.

Carol wanted to say a few words of greeting.

"Mark, when did you come? How long have you been waiting? We are today..."

Before she could finish her words, she was interrupted by Mark.

He didn't give Carol a single look, he just took the bag in my hand and helped me press my shoulders.

"It must have been hard for my wife to go to work, right? I told you a long time ago, don't go to work, I'll take care of you, or you can come to my company, and you can choose any position you want."

Noticing Carol's pale face, I sighed in a low voice, but I didn't intend to get her out of the siege. I was not a saint.

Then, following Mark's topic just now, he rebuked.

"Your company doesn't match my major, and I still want to do something I like."

While talking, we had already walked to the side of the car, and he eagerly opened the passenger door for me.

Just as I was about to sit in, Carol suddenly pushed me aside.

Thanks to Mark's quick eyes and hands to help me, I didn't fall to the ground.

At the same time, she sat directly in the passenger seat.

Using her clamp-like voice, she said sweetly to us.

"I have carsickness. Ashley, you have always been fierce, so please let me sit in the passenger seat, okay?"

As she said that, she kept staring at Mark with her watery eyes.

This time, I was directly amused, so I didn't say a word, and stared straight at Mark to see what his reaction would be.

Sure enough, he rolled his eyes impatiently.

"I'm eating with my wife, you have to come in, we didn't say anything to you, and you dare to squeeze my wife now? Is this your car that makes you so arrogant?"

Don't look at Mark being so dog-like in front of me, he is very aloof to outsiders.

In other words, aloofness is his protective color. If anyone dares to continue to approach him regardless of the appearance of aloofness, then they can only face the endless poisonous tongue of this dog man.

A seat said that Carol was crying, and it seemed that she didn't expect the man who seemed to be easy to talk to on WeChat to be so unkind when they met.

She defended herself in a panic.

"No, I didn't mean it... I'm just a little dizzy..."

Mark frowned again.

"If you're dizzy, go back by yourself. If you vomit on my car, no matter how much you pay, you can't get my car back."

Seeing that the situation was about to escalate, I quickly came out to smooth things over and glared at him without leaving any trace.

"Okay, okay, what a big deal. Carol, Mark is not in a good mood, so don't mind too much, why don't you continue to sit in the passenger seat, and I'll drive."

"No!" Before Carol could say anything, Mark, who always followed me, directly expressed his opposition.

I raised my eyebrows, only to hear his muffled voice.

"I'm still here, how can there be any reason for my wife to drive?"

As he said that, he looked sharply at Carol, so frightened that she shuddered.

"If you are really uncomfortable, I will call a car for you now and send you home. If you have no problem, sit in the back yourself and apologize to Ashley."

Carol was a little reluctant, but seeing his expression, she knew that if she continued to be stubborn, the man in front of her might really take her out.

So she got out of the car obediently, walked to the back seat, and her tone was still delicate.

"I'm sorry, I thought the seat was free to sit on. It doesn't matter if I sit in the back. Don't be angry because of me."

What a big white lotus flower, Mark and I looked at each other, and the two of them tacitly didn't say anything to pick up her words.

I was more helpless, but Mark's face turned a little dark.

Isn't it?

His expected two-person space was gone. Even if I signed the unequal treaty, he was still unhappy.

However, now I also have my own ideas. Facing a thick-skinned person like Carol, it would be too painless to just drive her away like this.

The game has just begun, isn't it?

5.

Dinner was set in the Le Petite Coconut restaurant, a membership-only joint on the 18th floor with a live violinist.

Huge floor-to-ceiling windows gave a killer view of the city.

It was supposed to be a romantic table for two by the window, now crammed with a third seat. Carol got the window view, naturally.

That's when I started to regret this whole thing.

Mark probably wanted to have a date with me, but I got caught up in being petty and wanting to mess with Carol, and now I'd ruined the mood.

Too late now.

So, I leaned into the PDA.

"Here, Mark, open up!"

Mark played along, letting me feed him a bite. He gazed at me, all soft and focused.

"Don't just worry about me, baby. You need to eat too. See anything you like? We'll order it."

I pinched his cheek, satisfied, and made to add some desserts.

Carol's cloying voice cut in, shattering the lovey-dovey vibe.

"Ashley, you definitely need to eat more! Good for you to eat! The healthier the body is stronger. I really want to eat it too, but I have a small appetite, so I am especially prone to physical weakness, alas."

She even winked at Mark in a playful manner.

Mark frowned unhappily. I squeezed his hand, stopping him before he blew up.

I didn't want to start a fight in public. If I really went after Carol, the good mood would be gone.

Who knew, my tolerance only earned her more intensified.

She pretended to be a considerate big sister and persuaded me.

"But Ashley, don't you hate me for saying harsh things, this place is too expensive. With our salary, how can we afford to spend in this kind of place? It's enough for Mark to bring us here once. If we order so much, won't it increase his burden?"

what the hell? ? ?

Did she think my Cartier and Hermes bags were all knockoffs?

Or did she think I was relying on Mark? Didn't she know I was rich?

I suddenly felt speechless and a little complicated.

Mark suddenly laughed.

Carol thought this was an affirmation of her, and her expression became even more smug, wanting to open her mouth to continue lecturing me.

But Mark slowly interrupted her.

"Miss Carol, are you being a little too controlling?"

She was stunned and froze on the spot.

Mark didn't look at her, he gently wiped the corners of my mouth with a tissue, and then continued to laugh.

"Miss Carol, don't you know that I'm a sugar baby? My Ashley only goes to work because she's interested. She's not like you, who can't eat the next meal without a job."

Carol was about to open her mouth, but Mark gently shook his head, signaling her not to speak. He was still smiling, but his whole body exuded a domineering aura.

I saw a trace of fear on Carol's face.

He continued.

"Miss Carol will never come to this kind of store in her life, right? My Ashley is kind-hearted and brought you here. Just be a background board and you will be fine. Why do you always learn to be a fly, buzzing and annoying people?"
