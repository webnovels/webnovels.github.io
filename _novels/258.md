The year I loved Julian Thorne the most, I was forced to personally attend to his pregnant mistress.

When his mistress faked an illness, Julian was convinced I’d tampered with her soup.

He condemned me to three days and three nights kneeling in the freezing snow.

While he was inside the mansion, doting on his mistress.

I could hear them, for three days and three nights, their passionate sounds echoing.

At one point, I heard Melody Hayes say:

"Julian, if you treat Aubrey like this, what if Aubrey stops loving you?"

Julian scoffed, a cold sneer on his lips:

"Impossible. She loves me so much she'd throw her life away for me."

He was right, I did love him desperately.

But what he didn't know.

This love had an expiration date.

The doctor said I had ten days before I would completely lose my memory.
