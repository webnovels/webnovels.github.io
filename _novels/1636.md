I’d been running on fumes for two weeks straight, sacrificing weekends and late nights, but it finally paid off. I landed that twelve-million-dollar deal, the one that snatched the company back from the brink of insolvency.
My boss, Rick Graham, was ecstatic. At the victory dinner, he’d called me the “backbone of the firm” and promised me a substantial bonus.
But when the end-of-month pay stub hit my inbox, I stared at the line item for commission, and the blood drained from my face.
A debit of $250. My commission was negative?
I actually owed the company two hundred and fifty dollars?
I immediately called Finance.
“Brenda, my pay statement—there must be a mistake.”
Brenda, the payroll manager, sounded deliberately vague. “No mistake, Bella. That’s Mr. Graham’s specific cost-accounting method. He said you’d understand.”
My heart sank. I bypassed the phone and knocked directly on Graham’s door.
He handed me a sheet of convoluted figures, smiling benignly. “That twelve-million-dollar order you signed? After factoring in the resource concessions, the advance capital outlay, and hidden overhead, the company’s net loss was $150,000. Due to the, ah, personal way you structured the deal, you’re responsible for 5% of that loss, which is $7,500.”
He gestured to the sheet. “We were generous and used your entire base salary to offset it. But since your salary wasn’t enough, you still owe the company two hundred and fifty dollars. Don’t worry,” he added with a wave of his hand, “the company is big-hearted. We’ll waive that.”
Then, moments later, the firm announced a ten-thousand-dollar bonus for Piper Wells, the fresh-faced intern who had just started and was known to be a personal friend of the family.
Watching the obvious favorite excitedly invite the whole office out to celebrate her windfall, something inside me broke.
I was done. Utterly, irrevocably done.
I started doing the bare minimum. Clocking in, clocking out. Nothing more.
A few days later, a critical project faced a major flaw, threatening the company with a massive penalty. Graham begged me to fix it.
I smiled back, just as benignly as he had.
“My apologies, Graham,” I said, showing him a folder. “I just finished processing my resignation. I’m no longer an employee of this firm.”
“You’ll need to find the person who received that ten-thousand-dollar bonus to clean up the mess.”

Listening to him casually use the phrase “the company is big-hearted, we’ll waive that,” my entire body went cold. Even my fingertips were numb.
My voice shook. “Graham! To land that deal, I worked two weeks straight! I drank until I ended up in the emergency room with a bleeding ulcer! Every single concession, every clause, was reported to you and got your explicit sign-off! Now you’re claiming this is a loss caused by my personal actions?”
I pushed up the sleeve of my left arm. The red, fading scar, still clearly visible from when I’d scalded myself with coffee rushing a project report, was a perfect, angry testament.
“This is the ‘backbone of the firm’ you mentioned at the dinner? My value is negative two hundred and fifty?”
Graham’s face darkened.
“Bella Steele!” He stressed my name, his tone a clear warning. “Mind your attitude! This is a professional environment. We affirm success, but we do not ignore problems! Your value isn't measured by a headline contract amount, but by the net result! You need to think long-term, not just obsess over petty cash!”
The company was collapsing. I’d single-handedly pulled them out of the fire with that deal. And this was the reward. My soul shriveled. All the grand visions, all the promises of a future and career path—they all became sickeningly ridiculous in that moment.
I took the cost-accounting sheet and walked back to my desk.
I’d barely collapsed into my chair when Brenda, from the opposite cubicle, leaned over with a smile full of nosy anticipation. “Bella, back so soon? Mr. Graham must have given you a huge bonus, right? A contract that big, your commission must be… this much?”
She made a subtle hand gesture, her eyes wide with envy.
I opened my mouth, but no sound came out. Negative two hundred and fifty. The sheer absurdity made me want to laugh hysterically.
Before I could form a response, Ben, a younger colleague, walked by with a coffee cup and leaned in conspiratorially.
“Bella, did you hear? Piper Wells, the new intern in Admin—she’s only been here a month, and Graham just personally approved a ten-thousand-dollar bonus! Ten grand! It’s supposedly for her ‘potential contributions.’ Some people just have all the luck.”
Piper, the boss’s relative. Her potential contribution? Ten thousand?
I landed a twelve-million-dollar contract and incurred a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar debt.
All the accumulated frustration and anger boiled over.
“How much did I get?” I sneered, opening the company-wide chat. “I’ll show you how much I got.”
I attached my pay stub and posted it.

I took a deep, shuddering breath and typed furiously.
[Bella Steele] @RickGraham Rick, would you mind explaining to the team why, after signing a $12 Million contract for the company, your accounting method shows my commission as a negative $8,750, leaving me personally owing the company $250?
[Bella Steele] And why is it that a new intern, Piper Wells, who has been here for one month, received a special bonus of $10,000? What specific, quantifiable contribution valued at $10,000 did she make to the company?
I leaned back, my chest heaving, my hands still trembling slightly.
Graham’s public response popped up in the company chat, the tone instantly harsh and disciplinary.
[Rick Graham] @BellaSteele Who authorized you to discuss a colleague’s compensation in a public forum? This is a severe violation of company policy! As the CEO, I see and acknowledge Piper Wells’ contributions, and her compensation is entirely appropriate! It is not your place to question it!
[Rick Graham] You caused the company a calculated, actual loss! The company chose not to pursue damages, which is an act of extreme goodwill! Do not be ungrateful, do not muddy the waters, and do not try to incite dissent!
It turned out that twisting reality could be done with a straight face and full self-righteousness.
My fingers shook as I typed my final reply: [Bella Steele] Since my hard work securing $12 Million is considered a loss, I will, from today onward, dedicate myself to being a quiet, compliant employee, ensuring I will not generate the company a single dollar of new, negative return!
I closed all my work-related documents and webpages, and clicked open the system’s pre-installed game of Spider Solitaire.
No orders, no negative returns. Simple. I was officially playing the corporate martyr.
At five-thirty, the end of the workday.
I didn’t, as I had countless nights before, glance over any pending tasks or strategize for the next day’s client calls.
I shut down my computer and stood up to leave.
“Bella… you’re leaving already?” Ben from the next cubicle asked instinctively, staring at his pile of unfinished work.
“Yep,” I nodded, my tone even. “Clocked out. Why stay? To create new negative profit?”
As I reached the main exit, Graham’s angry voice boomed behind me: “Bella Steele! Where is the client data analysis report? Mr. Thompson needs it first thing tomorrow!”
I paused, turning back slightly. “Graham, I’m clearly incompetent. You should find a more capable colleague—or one whose contributions are valued—to handle it.”
Graham’s face was dark purple. He roared, “Fine! Piper, you take over the Thompson account! And you’re out as Team Lead, effective immediately!”
Piper’s voice was full of breathless excitement. “I won’t let you down, Mr. Graham!”
I walked out, a cold smile forming. Let’s see her handle it, I thought.

The next morning, Graham’s voice was booming in the office.
“Mr. Thompson, Bella’s been under the weather lately, yes. But we’ve assigned a more senior colleague to the follow-up. Absolutely no issues!”
My heart gave a faint, cynical skip. It was Mr. Thompson, the twelve-million-dollar client.
More senior? I scoffed internally. Who else in this company understood the complex, customized requirements of that project the way I did?
Graham deliberately walked over to my desk.
“Bella, the company has decided to focus on developing Piper’s skills, and she’s now Project Lead. You need to adjust your attitude and check your emotions at the door. The company keeps turning, with or without you!”
I gave him a sweet, fake smile. “Understood, Graham. I’m completely unbothered.”
Piper smugly took her place at my old Team Lead desk.
The crucial project coordination meeting began precisely on time that afternoon.
Mr. Thompson and his team were already seated in the conference room.
I sat at my cubicle and could just faintly hear the muffled conversation, which, surprisingly, didn’t sound like the intense argument I’d expected.
A long while later, the door opened. Graham walked out, accompanying Mr. Thompson and his team, wearing a look of relieved satisfaction.
“Mr. Thompson, don’t worry, Piper is young, but she’s a quick study. We will absolutely deliver on this project!” Graham’s voice was sickeningly sycophantic.
Mr. Thompson nodded faintly, then spoke to a clearly expectant Piper. “Ms. Wells, that initial report and your presentation outline were very clear. Good foundation. Keep it up.”
It wasn't a glowing review, but to Graham and Piper, it was the sound of a heavenly choir.
“Thank you, Mr. Thompson! I’ll work even harder!” Piper’s voice trembled with excitement.
After seeing off the client, Graham clapped Piper heavily on the shoulder and declared loudly, making sure the entire office heard: “Excellent! Well done! I knew you could do it! Some people, who think too highly of themselves, need to see the new guard taking over!”
The office eyes shifted, intentionally or not, toward me.
Piper, clutching a folder, walked over to me, her face alight with triumph.
“Bella,” she said, flaunting the folder. “You heard Mr. Thompson, right? Honestly, it wasn’t much—just a basic analysis report. Maybe it’s complicated for some people, but I think, if you just apply yourself, it’s no big deal.”
She deliberately held the folder up and shook it in front of me. “Looks like the company keeps turning just fine without anyone, doesn’t it? Maybe even better.”
I recognized the report instantly. It was a draft file I had saved on my work computer.
My voice remained calm. “That report you handed Mr. Thompson, that was a file from my computer, correct?”
Piper’s face went rigid with indignation. “So what if it was? The computer is company property, so the files are company assets! As the Project Lead, what’s the problem with using company data?”
“The problem is presenting someone else’s labor as your own, and using it to claim credit. That’s theft.”
“You’re lying!” Piper shrieked, like a cornered animal. “I referenced it! I borrowed it! Graham said all resources must be used for the project! I already copied every single follow-up folder for this account from your computer! It’s all gone! Whether you’re here or not is irrelevant to the project now!”
I allowed myself a small, internal smile. “Then I sincerely wish you success with the project follow-up.”
The files on my computer were the initial, first-generation versions, with zero connection to the project’s actual core logic. A simple analysis report wouldn’t show the difference yet. But if she continued to use those files…
The real show was just about to begin.

Under Piper’s lead, the project, supported by the foundational work and framework she had essentially stolen from me, continued smoothly for a while.
This convinced Graham that he no longer needed me.
The few remaining legacy clients still under my management were forcibly transferred to other colleagues under the guise of “unified management.”
He began chipping away at me in public forums, his passive-aggressive hostility palpable.
During the morning huddle, he’d randomly call me out: “Bella, I looked at your workload statistics for the month. It’s almost blank! We don’t pay people to sit around. Show some initiative!”
If he walked past my desk and saw me browsing industry news, he’d sneer: “Well, look at you, so relaxed. Found a new job, have we? If so, pack up and leave. Don't occupy a valuable seat.”
He even had HR send an email, citing an “office space optimization” initiative, demanding I move my desk to a desolate corner by the breakroom, a space that never saw sunlight.
I didn't protest. I quietly packed my things and moved.
I took every petty obstacle he threw at me, waiting. Graham, however, finally lost his patience and decided to force the issue.
He called me into his office, getting straight to the point.
“Bella, let’s be adults about this.” He leaned back in his CEO chair, looking down on me. “Everyone sees your recent behavior—the slacking, the zero work ethic. It’s severely damaging the team morale and the company culture.”
I played dumb. “Graham, I don’t understand. When did I start slacking off?”
He scoffed. “Still denying it? You clock in and out exactly on time, you refuse new assignments, you’re not communicating with your old clients, and you spend your day playing solitaire or browsing the web! What else would you call it?”
“You misunderstand, Graham.” My tone was sincere. “I don’t dare answer client calls easily, for fear of saying the wrong thing; I don’t dare take on complex projects, for fear of miscalculating costs; and I certainly don’t dare work overtime, for fear of consuming more company resources and causing an even greater loss.”
“I am strictly adhering to your explicit instructions to mitigate risk and avoid creating any new, actual losses for the company.”
He pointed at me, sputtered for a full minute, and could not land a single syllable.
Graham just wanted me to quit so he wouldn’t have to pay my severance package.
I cut to the chase. “Graham, you just don’t want to pay the N+1, do you?”
“That is slander!” He raised his voice, volume hiding his guilt. “The company adheres to policy! You have an attitude problem, you’re not keeping up with the company’s trajectory!”
I looked at his flustered, paper-tiger expression and simply found it pitiful. Using the smallest possible cost to resolve the biggest headache—that was his guiding principle.
I decided not to argue over the severance money. It was beneath me. I was simply waiting for the grand drama I had set in motion.
I said lightly, “I’ll resign. In the next two days.”
Two days. That was enough.
Enough time for the stolen, outdated analysis report to detonate all the hidden issues during the truly critical project testing phase.
Graham’s face lit up with satisfied triumph. He clearly assumed I was folding under the pressure, giving up the fight.
“Hmph,” he grunted through his nose. “Smart move.”
He waved his hand, dismissing me like a bothersome fly. “Process your paperwork quickly. Don’t drag it out and disrupt the others.”
“Will do.”
I turned and left his office.
The project entered its most crucial testing phase right on schedule.
On the morning of the test, the documentation described logic and data that were fundamentally inconsistent with the actual system. A critical, fatal flaw. The entire project team went into a panic.
Mr. Thompson’s acceptance team was already en route. If we couldn't demonstrate today, the partnership would be over, and the company would face massive breach of contract penalties.
Graham roared, “Piper Wells! What the hell is going on? These reports, these proposals—didn’t you prepare them?”
Piper flinched, tears instantly welling up. “T-these foundational reports and core modules were all done by Bella! I, I just built the follow-up work on her basis!”
He bellowed toward the door, “Bella! Get her in here!”
“No need to call, Graham.” I walked in, holding a slim folder.
He lunged toward me. “Bella, quick! What’s wrong with this? Fix it, Thompson’s team is almost here!”
I held up a hand, looking perfectly innocent.
“Graham, I’m afraid I can’t. I just finalized my separation paperwork. I’m no longer an employee of this company.”
