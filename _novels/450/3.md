Early the next morning, I didn't wait for the driver.

Contrary to my usual style, I put on elaborate makeup and changed into the white dress Gabriel liked best.

Seeing me come downstairs, Gabriel looked up and scanned me, his eyes filled with scrutiny and warning.

I returned a docile smile, obediently sitting across from him.

"Gabriel, I've thought it through."

My tone was calm. "You're right. Helping Miss Aria won't cost me anything."

"I'll be good and do as you say."

Gabriel clearly hadn't expected me to agree so quickly.

"It's good that you see it that way."

"I'll have the lawyers redraft that agreement. If you cooperate, the compensation can be increased by another $500,000."

He was always so confident about me.

I lowered my eyes, hiding the mockery in them.

"The money's not important. What's important is, I have one condition."

"Go on."

I raised my head, looking straight into his eyes. "I want to meet Miss Aria."

"After all, I'm the child's mother. I have the right to know who my child is saving."

"And... I want to see for myself what kind of woman is worth you going to such lengths for."

Gabriel's brow furrowed, as if weighing the pros and cons.

I continued to push, my voice tinged with a hint of grievance and trembling.

"Don't worry, I won't do anything. I just... just want to let myself give up completely."

"Let me see her, and I can let go of all my fantasies about you, and calmly... complete this transaction."

Perhaps the word "transaction" pleased him.

Or perhaps my current appearance, sufficiently pitiful and submissive, was enough.

He was silent for a moment, then finally nodded.

"Fine."

"I'll arrange it for this afternoon."

The first step of my plan was successful.

That afternoon, Gabriel personally drove me to that expensive private hospital.

Compared to the ordinary single room where I had my prenatal checkups,

Aria's room was a VIP suite on the top floor, filled with sunlight, as cozy as a princess's chamber.

It seems favoritism is evident in every detail.

Hiding my bitterness, I looked up.

Aria was wearing pink hospital pajamas, her face pale as she leaned weakly against the headboard.

Seeing Gabriel enter, her eyes lit up, her voice sweet and soft.

"Gabriel, you're here."

Her gaze fell on me, especially on my belly. That fragility instantly mixed with a barely noticeable hint of scrutiny and smugness.

Gabriel walked over, tucking her blanket with practiced tenderness that could melt ice.

"Aria, I brought Olivia to see you."

Only then did Aria turn her full attention to me, giving me an apologetic smile.

"Mrs. Gu, hello."

"I'm so sorry that my illness has caused you so much trouble."

As she spoke, she gave a weak cough, her eyes rimming with red.

"If there was any other way, I wouldn't have agreed to Gabriel doing this."

"I hope you don't blame him, he's just too worried about me."

What a pitiful white lotus.

In a few words, she absolved herself of all responsibility, while highlighting Gabriel's deep love for her.

I stood silently, just quietly looking at her.

Then I smiled.

I walked to her bedside, leaned down, and whispered so only the two of us could hear.

"Miss Song, your acting is truly impressive."

"But you'd better be able to fool Gabriel for the rest of your life, and pray that I never reveal the truth."

Aria's expression changed instantly!
