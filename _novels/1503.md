My husband was cheating, and he wanted me to walk away from our marriage with nothing. Heartbroken, I decided to jump off a bridge.
I had just climbed over the railing when a voice suddenly spoke from inside my belly:
【Mom! Don’t do it!】
【I’ve been reborn! In my last life, that deadbeat dad kicked us out for his mistress, and then he won eighty million dollars from a lottery ticket he found!】
The news just made me sadder. I was about to let go when the voice piped up again:
【I know the winning numbers for that ticket. We can snatch it from him. You can’t die!】
【But first things first: Deadbeat Dad has a stash of cash hidden in the bedroom ceiling. Let’s grab the money, then we can divorce him!】
My legs stopped shaking. My heart stopped pounding.
The first thing I did when I got home was borrow a ladder and start taking apart the ceiling.
…
I’d run home in tears, so the housekeeper didn’t dare stop me.
I locked the bedroom door.
I set up the ladder, kicked off my shoes, and glanced down at my slightly rounded belly.
“Son, you sure about the location? Your father will be back soon. If we get this wrong, we won’t get a second chance.”
A voice, young but full of swagger, echoed in my mind:
【Trust me, Mom! In the last life, this was his favorite spot to hide gold bars.】
【Third panel from the left. Push hard!】
I took a deep breath and climbed the ladder.
My hands were trembling.
Not from fear, but from excitement.
To force me into a divorce, Liam had frozen all my cards. He called it giving me time to “cool off,” but really, he was cutting off my resources to make me submit.
And he wanted me to leave with nothing?
In his dreams.
I pushed hard against the decorative drop-ceiling tile.
A cloud of dust rained down, stinging my eyes.
But I didn’t have time to rub them.
Because my fingers had touched a heavy canvas bag.
Damn, it was heavy.
I struggled to drag the bag out, nearly losing my balance and falling off the ladder.
【Careful, Mom! A fall like that, and it’s game over for both of us!】
“Don’t jinx it.”
With trembling hands, I opened the bag.
A golden glint nearly blinded me.
It was full of gold bars.
I’d never seen this much physical gold in my life.
I dug deeper and found a stack of hundred-dollar bills underneath.
“How much is in here?”
【About five million. It’s money Deadbeat Dad siphoned from the company behind his partner’s back. It was supposed to be his startup fund to go live it up overseas with that homewrecker.】
【In the last life, you foolishly jumped off that bridge and let those two get away with everything!】
【They used this money to reinvent themselves abroad, then came back as famous entrepreneurs and forgot you ever existed!】
Hearing that, a fire ignited in my chest.
Liam, you bastard.
I was with you when we were building this from nothing, when we were scraping by on instant noodles. You get rich, and not only do you find a mistress, but you hide a fortune and hope I’ll just die?
I took the gold bars out one by one and packed them into a suitcase I’d prepared.
“What happens when Liam comes back and finds the money gone?” I worried, staring at the dark hole in the ceiling.
If he found out, forget divorce. I might not make it out of this house alive today.

【Are you kidding, Mom?】
【Stuff a few of those old books from that box in there to give it some weight, then put the panel back!】
【He won’t open that thing for years. By the time he notices, we’ll be long gone!】
It hit me. Of course.
I grabbed a few of the dense, academic books Liam kept on a high shelf to look smart, shoved them into the canvas bag, and placed it back in the ceiling.
I carefully clicked the panel back into place.
I even wiped away my fingerprints from the edges.
When I was done, I sat on the floor, my heart hammering against my ribs like a drum.
This was more thrilling than standing on the edge of that bridge.
Just then, I heard the front door open downstairs.
It was Liam’s impatient voice. “Maria, is that crazy woman back yet?”
I froze.
【Mom! Don’t lose your nerve!】
【You’re the victim here. You have to act completely broken, make him think you’ve given up the fight!】
I kicked the suitcase full of gold deep under the bed.
Then, I mussed my hair, sat on the edge of the bed, and summoned the despair.
The tears came on command.
When Liam pushed the door open, he was greeted by the sight of my "utterly defeated" self.
A flash of disgust crossed his face.
“Not dead yet? I thought you had more backbone.”
He loosened his tie, his expression dripping with annoyance. “Since you’re still here, you can sign this.”
A set of divorce papers slapped against my face.
“If you agree to walk away with nothing, I’ll even pay for you to get rid of the thing in your belly. After all, it’ll be hard for you to remarry with a kid in tow.”
Get rid of it?
Even the most vicious animals don’t eat their young.
How could he say something so monstrous?
Hatred grew in my heart like a weed.
But I knew this wasn’t the time to let it show.
I slowly lifted my head, my eyes vacant.
Just as my son taught me, I had to play the part of a woman whose heart was shattered beyond repair.
“Liam, after seven years of marriage, are you really going to be this cruel?” My voice was hoarse and trembling.
Liam scoffed and lit a cigarette, completely ignoring the fact that I was pregnant.
“Hannah, we’re adults. Let’s not make this ugly.”
“Jenna’s pregnant. It’s a boy. I need to give them a proper family.”
“We don’t even know if yours is a boy or a girl. If it’s a girl, I’d be losing out.”
【Please! I’m your daddy!】 my little ancestor cursed from inside.
【Ignore him, Mom. The idiot doesn’t even know the kid his mistress is carrying isn’t his!】
【It’s her personal trainer’s!】
I almost burst out laughing.
I quickly bowed my head, covering my face with my hands as my shoulders shook.
To Liam, I was sobbing my heart out.
“Fine… I’ll sign.”
I looked up, my face streaked with tears, my eyes full of grim resolve.
“But I have one condition.”
Liam frowned, his eyes narrowing with suspicion. “You want money? Let me tell you, the company has no cash on the books right now. I’m drowning in debt…”
“I don’t want money.”
I cut him off, my voice tragic. “I just want to take my clothes and some of my personal things.”
“I don’t want anything else in this house.”
“I want to make a clean break from you.”
Liam was stunned. He clearly hadn’t expected me to be so agreeable.
A flicker of delight crossed his face before he quickly suppressed it.
“Fine. Glad you’ve got some sense.”
“Pack your things and get out tonight. We’ll go to the courthouse first thing in the morning.”
With that, he turned and left, as if looking at me for a second longer would bring him bad luck.
The moment the door closed, I wiped away my tears.
I dragged the suitcase out from under the bed.
I covered the gold with a layer of old clothes and threw in some cheap toiletries.
Then I wheeled the suitcase out, ready for a quick exit.
Liam was on the sofa, video-chatting with Jenna, his voice dripping with a tenderness I hadn’t heard in years.
When he saw me, he stood up and walked over.
“Hold on. Open it. I want to make sure you didn’t take anything you shouldn’t have.”

My heart leaped into my throat. For a second, I debated whether I should just knock him out and run.
But when Liam saw my clothes, he just curled his lip in disdain.
“Is that all you’re taking? This junk? You sure you don’t want to look again? Don’t say I never gave you a chance.”
I gave him a pitiful smile. “No, thank you. Everything in this house… is tainted.”
Liam’s face darkened. “Get out! Just get out!”
I pushed the heavy suitcase out of the door that I once thought was the entrance to my forever home.
The moment I was out of the complex, I hailed a cab and went straight to a five-star hotel downtown.
【Nice one, Mom!】
【That scumbag is probably still dreaming about all his money. His face when he finds that empty ceiling is going to be priceless.】
【But we have to hurry, Mom.】
【After you get the divorce finalized tomorrow, we have to buy that lottery ticket!】
【Eighty million dollars is waiting!】
I sat in the back of the cab, watching the city lights blur past.
The knot of resentment that had been strangling me for so long finally started to loosen.
Liam, you think you got rid of a washed-up housewife.
You have no idea you just kicked your personal cash cow out the door.
That night, in a luxury suite, I ordered a seafood feast I never would have dreamed of affording before.
As I devoured a king crab leg, my son filled me in on the gossip from his past life.
Apparently, after I’d died by suicide, Liam hadn’t shed a single tear. Instead, he released a statement saying I’d had mental health issues. He used my death to craft a public persona of a devoted, grieving husband, and his company’s stock soared.
The mistress, Jenna, used my life insurance payout to buy limited-edition handbags.
They even had my ashes scattered over some random, godforsaken mountain.
Hearing this, I crushed the crab leg in my hand.
“Son, I will get revenge for you. I swear it.”
【You bet! And Mom, there’s going to be a big show at the courthouse tomorrow.】
【Jenna will definitely be there to gloat.】
【You have to hold back. Whatever you do, don’t hit her.】
【Because… all her designer stuff is fake. The color will rub off if you touch it, and then she’ll try to sue us for damages.】
I snorted with laughter.
This kid was even more savage than I was.
The next morning, at the courthouse.
Liam was practically glowing, his hair slicked back with gel.
Clinging to his arm was Jenna.
Her pregnant belly was on full display in a tight dress, as if to make sure everyone knew.
Seeing me standing there alone, Jenna covered her mouth and giggled. “Oh, dear. You look terrible. Did you have nowhere to stay last night? Sleep under a bridge?”
Liam patted her on the butt, feigning concern. “Don’t say that. You’ll upset Hannah and she’ll go jump off another one.”
Then he turned to me with a condescending look. “You have your papers? Let’s get this over with. I have to get back to the office.”

I ignored them and walked straight inside.
Sign, stamp, collect the certificate.
I was completely silent and cooperative through the entire process.
The moment the divorce decree was in his hand, Liam let out a huge sigh of relief, as if he’d just shed a massive burden.
As we walked out, Jenna deliberately kissed him right in front of me.
“We’re finally free, honey! Let’s go celebrate!”
Liam wrapped an arm around her, pinching her cheek affectionately. “Whatever you want, sweetheart.”
Then he turned to me, pulled a few crisp hundred-dollar bills from his wallet, and threw them on the ground.
“Here. For the cab. Don’t say I have no heart.”
The bills fluttered to the pavement, mocking my powerlessness.
People around us started to stare and whisper.
I bent down.
A triumphant smirk spread across Liam and Jenna’s faces.
They thought I was going to pick up the money.
Instead, I just retied my shoelace.
When I stood up, I planted my foot on the bills and ground them into the dirty concrete.
“Keep it, Liam. You might need it for your medical bills.”
“You have a dark cloud hanging over you. I sense a great disaster in your future.”
Liam’s face turned green with rage. “Hannah! Don’t push your luck!”
Jenna shrieked, “Who are you cursing?”
I just smiled coldly, hailed a cab, and left them standing there.
In the car, my palms were sweating.
“Son, what if he finds out the stuff in the ceiling is gone?”
【So what if he does?】
【The divorce is final, and the asset division agreement is signed.】
【It says in black and white that personal belongings are not to be shared.】
【Those gold bars are your ‘personal belongings.’ Does he have any proof they were his?】
【That was his secret stash, money he couldn't legally account for! You think he’s going to call the cops and admit to embezzling company assets?】
I slapped my thigh.
He was right!
Liam was completely screwed. He had to eat this loss.
Now, for the most important part: the lottery ticket.
Following my son’s instructions, I went to a nondescript convenience store on the outskirts of the city.
“Five quick picks, please.”
【No! Mom! Not quick picks!】
【I’ll give you the numbers, write them down!】
【05, 12, 19, 26, 31, and the power numbers, 08, 14.】
I quickly corrected myself. “Sorry, I’d like to choose my own numbers.”
Holding that thin slip of paper, I felt it burn hotter than the bag of gold.
Eighty million dollars.
If this hit, I’d be set for life.
“Son, are you sure about this?”
【Positive! In the last life, the winner was a homeless man. He bought a bottle of booze, got drunk, and lost the ticket. Deadbeat Dad found it and claimed the prize.】
【This time, we’re cutting him off at the pass!】
Just as excitement surged through me, the ticket was snatched from my hand.
I looked up. It was Liam.
