Alexander came back ten minutes later.
He didn't dare look at me, just handed me what he bought and quickly got into the driver's seat, locking the car doors.
"I had someone send over some ginger tea with red dates. It's at home. Do you... want to go back and drink it?"
Alexander's words carried a hint of caution.
It made me laugh a little.
Alexander was a well-known second generation rich kid in the city.
He was also Jack's best friend.
In the past when I went out to eat with Jack, Alexander was always there.
Back then he was very cold towards me, especially when people around us urged Jack and me to show affection, he wouldn't even give us a glance.
He even sneered and showed disgust.
To the point where people in that circle all thought he hated me.
Until later, on the day of Jack's "fatal" car accident, I received a video.
A video sent by Alexander.
In the video Jack was laughing as he told someone:
"The thought of being with only Emily after marriage is unbearable.
"I'll fake my death and play around for a few more years. Comfort her often, don't let her do anything stupid."
But I never expected that this fake death was actually Alexander's idea.
This man was quite scheming.
