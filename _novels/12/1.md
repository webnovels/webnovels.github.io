The friends around us were stunned, then quickly tried to persuade me:
"Emily, how can you say you don't know Jack? We kept it from you, it's not Jack's fault."
"Yeah, Emily, we did it for your own good, afraid you'd always be worried. Now that Jack's finally awake, don't be petty with him."
The room was filled with accusations.
Before I could speak, a scornful laugh rang out.
Jack stood up from the couch, cigarette between his fingers, looking lazy and smug as he said, "If we don't know each other, then forget it. Saves me the trouble of being responsible."
The young woman by his side clung to Jack's arm, looking up at him shyly and nervously:
"Jack... I know you. She doesn't appreciate you, I... I'm willing to marry you, okay?"
Jack didn't respond. He glanced at me coldly, then wrapped his arm around the girl's waist and kissed her deeply.
Seeing this, the friends around us quickly blocked my view.
They comforted me:
"Emily, Jack lost his memory. You know he loved you the most before."
"Yeah, Em, you should take care of Jack and help him remember you. Don't be upset."
I opened my mouth, about to say something to Jack's friends, when a sudden pain shot through my stomach.
My face paled involuntarily. I didn't linger, turning to leave the room.
I left so quickly that the people in the room didn't react in time.
After I disappeared completely, they sighed to Jack:
"Jack, you went too far. Emily's really jealous and angry now, her face went white. Don't let her really leave you."
Jack smiled, sitting back on the couch.
"Emily's easy to coax. After two years apart, I don't believe she doesn't miss me.
"Besides, I've lost my memory now. When I'm done playing around, I'll tell her my memory's back, say the past wasn't my intention. I won't even need to apologize, just beckon and she'll come running back."
