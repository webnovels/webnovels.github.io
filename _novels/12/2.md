After leaving the room, I could no longer hold back and crouched down.
The pain in my stomach came in waves, leaving me without the strength to even go to the restroom.
Until a shadow fell over me.
A familiar voice said:
"What, heartbroken? Want to rekindle the flame?"
I looked up to see Alexander Hughes leaning against the doorframe not far away, arms crossed, looking at me impassively.
He was dressed all in black, with a high bridge nose and eyes hidden in the dim light, emotions unreadable.
In the light, his thin lips had beautiful, clean lines.
In that moment, a feeling of being wrongly accused welled up in my heart.
Tears fell uncontrollably.
Alexander panicked, quickly dropping his arms and walking over to me.
"Don't cry, I won't say that again."
He had a great physique, strong and powerful.
He picked me up from the ground with one arm.
The scent of cedar entered my nose, stirring my heartstrings.
I wrapped my arms around his neck and said:
"My stomach hurts..."
Alexander paused slightly: "It's early?"
I nodded, my lips inadvertently brushing his jaw as I rested my head on his broad shoulder.
Alexander carried me to the car, turned on the heat and said:
"Wait in the car, I'll go buy you some things."
After saying that, he closed the car door and left.
The dim streetlight poured down from above, outlining his tall figure.
Not long after, a video call came in.
It was from Alexander.
"Your usual brand is sold out. Do you see any you like among these?"
I was about to choose when a familiar voice tinged with surprise came from the video.
Jack walked into the store with his arm around the young woman's waist. He looked Alexander up and down in surprise and said:
"We invited you out for drinks tonight but you didn't come. Turns out you're here buying things for a woman!
"Are you on a video call with her? Let me see who the amazing woman is that got our Mr. Hughes to open up!"
Jack reached out to grab Alexander's phone.
I instinctively moved my face away from the camera.
But Jack didn't touch Alexander's phone.
Alexander just gave him a cold look, and Jack's hand retracted.
"Alright, alright, I see you're protective of your treasure. Next time you must bring her out to meet us!
"By the way, Alex, I ran into Emily. She walked into the wrong room and caught me kissing another woman. I was scared to death, but luckily the other guys were quick-witted and said I had amnesia. I'll play around a bit more, then regain my memory.
"Of course, you really helped me out too, bro. Back then when I wasn't done playing, your idea of faking my death was brilliant!"
The phone screen shook, and the next second my end showed the call had been disconnected.
