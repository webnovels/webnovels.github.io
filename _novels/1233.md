I was about to give birth, my body wracked with contractions, yet my husband stood there, his face a mask of cold indifference, barring my entry to the delivery suite.

"You don't deserve this VIP suite," Harrison said, his voice flat.

I collapsed to the floor, clutching my stomach as pain tore through me. A gaggle of relatives approached, wrapping their snickers in faux whispers.

"Harrison, you truly have the patience of a saint. You spent three years coaxing this counterfeit heiress to carry your child, but from now on, you'll only acknowledge the real one."

Moments later, Veronica, the "real" daughter who had been switched at birth twenty years ago, walked past me. She was wearing the same maternity gown I was. Supported gently by Harrison’s arm, she glided into the VIP suite.

Nurses swarmed them, ushering them away. I tried to struggle to my feet, but my own biological parents held me down.

My father, Dr. Whitman, the hospital director, spoke with a heavy, final tone. "Veronica’s constitution is weak. She can’t handle stress. The VIP resources must go to her."

My mother, a former head nurse, wiped a tear from her eye. "Sarah, Veronica suffered so much living on that farm. She’s finally home. Don't fight her for this."

My grandmother, Nana Rose, who had always doted on me, let out a sigh. "You stole twenty years of a luxurious life from her. Giving up a delivery room is the least you can do. Consider it a bargain."

They ignored the plummeting heart rate of my unborn child. They ignored the medical indicators screaming for a C-section. They wheeled me toward a general ward for a natural birth.

I gripped the hem of my gown until my knuckles turned white. I didn't cry. I didn't scream. But the corner of my mouth twitched upward. I couldn't hide the smile.

After failing to find any family members willing to sign for me, the nurse handed me a thick stack of surgical consent forms.

I signed without hesitation. As the pen lifted from the paper, a mechanical prompt echoed in my mind.

"Host life threat detected. Trigger 'Cost Liquidation' mode to exit?"

Trigger, I recited silently in my heart, my fingertips pale from the pressure.

"Please confirm liquidation targets: Husband Harrison King, Father Dr. Whitman, Mother Linda Whitman?"

Add one more. I watched Nana Rose through the open door, standing on her tiptoes, haggling with the nurse for the "most economical" natural birth package. My voice was ice.

And Veronica.

"Liquidation targets locked. Host vital signs currently meet the criteria for 'Desperate Counterattack.' Initiate immediate protection mechanism?"

Initiate immediately.

I had arranged everything long ago. Even the midwives were my own hires; I hadn't let my parents' staff near me.

The nurse came back, looking uncomfortable. She told me the family's consensus was to use the cheapest package just to get the baby out.

Even the consent form regarding "save the mother or the child" had been left to me to decide.

My heart turned to ash. I grabbed the nurse's hand, pleading. "Give me the best natural birth package available. I have my own money."

This was my twenty-fifth year in this world, and the first year since Veronica had been found and brought home.

Before her return, I was the princess, held in the palm of this family's hand.

In my original world, I had a miserable marriage and parents who favored my brother. So when the System first approached me, I refused to leave.

I wanted to accompany my parents and Nana Rose into their old age.

Now, it seemed, it was all smoke and mirrors.

All they cared about was the blood that bound them.

Ten minutes passed. The delivery team the nurse summoned saw that my vitals clearly indicated a need for a C-section. They called the family in again.

Nana Rose walked in, clutching the consent forms, her face a storm of displeasure.

"Your belly looks heavy, but the baby isn't that big. What do we need all these people for? Stop thinking about a C-section. You think our money grows on trees?"

The doctor couldn't stand it and interjected. "The fetal heart rate is dropping rapidly. We need to operate immediately."

I was sweating profusely from the pain, but Nana Rose dismissed everyone else, claiming she needed to speak with me alone.

She walked up to the bed and held up her phone, her voice dropping to a threat. "Everyone is busy with Veronica. You be a good girl. There’s twenty percent of the company shares waiting to be transferred to your name after the birth. If you don't cooperate, you won't see a dime."

I looked at my grandmother, usually so gentle, now glaring at me with undisguised disgust. It was as if the love she had shown me for decades never existed.

I reached out to press the nurse call button. She slapped my hand away.

She picked up the phone and barked an order.

"Send two men in. This girl isn't cooperating. She still wants a C-section. She's obviously trying to compete with Veronica!"

Moments later, two bodyguards carrying stun batons walked into the delivery room.

I screamed for help, but Nana Rose clamped her hand over my mouth and nose.

"This is our hospital," she hissed. "You could scream until your throat bleeds, and no one would come."

Harrison pushed the door open then, carrying a gift bag from a high-end jeweler.

He frowned when he saw me, drenched in sweat, my lips ghostly pale.

"We're doing this for your own good, Sarah. Natural birth has a faster recovery time. I've already spoken to the doctor."

"Spoken to them? You mean you told them to suppress my C-section indicators?"

I slowly lifted my head, my gaze sweeping over their evasive faces.

"Harrison, last week you told me the company had cash flow issues. You made me mortgage the house I bought two years ago. Was that just to get cash for Veronica?"

Harrison’s face flushed red. "What are you talking about? That was strictly company business."

"Is that so? And maxing out my supplementary card to buy a twenty-thousand-dollar bag for a 'client'—was that real too?"

I let out a bitter laugh. Suddenly, a sharp, tearing pain radiated from my abdomen. The fetal heart monitor began to scream an alarm.

Harrison looked panicked for a second, then composed himself. "Stop screaming! You're making it worse by getting agitated. Dr. Lee is coming. She'll handle it."

"Handle it? You’re forcing me to forego surgery because you want me and the baby dead. That way, you and Veronica can be together legitimately, right?"

My body shook with agony. The System prompt chimed in my head.

"Immediate protection mechanism active. Automatically contacting the emergency team from the rival Tier-1 Trauma Center. Estimated arrival: ten minutes. Evidence of Dr. Lee’s malpractice detected. Synchronizing with the State Medical Board reporting channel."

Dr. Lee rushed in. Her face paled when she saw the numbers on the monitor.

She opened her mouth to speak, but after catching a glimpse of Nana Rose’s dark expression, she steeled herself. "Don't be nervous. It's just Braxton Hicks. I'll give you something to suppress the contractions..."

"No need."

Dr. Lee’s hand trembled in confusion, dropping the syringe to the floor.

Harrison grabbed my wrist, his brow furrowed tight. "What the hell are you trying to do?"

I waved my phone, a weak smile curling my lips. "Nothing much. Just letting you know that I've been livestreaming everything in this room."

"I met the criteria for a C-section thirty minutes ago. You disregarded my life and the life of my child. The internet will call the police for me."

Harrison signaled the bodyguards. They swarmed forward, smashing my phone to pieces.

The men pinned me down, rendering me immobile.

Harrison walked up to me, his eyes bloodshot with rage, and grabbed my chin.

"You still think you're the Princess of the King family? You're nothing but a switched-at-birth mistake! A mutt!"

"Even if you meet the surgical standards, so what? Until Veronica delivers safely, there is no place for you."

I suddenly laughed. "So, in a hospital this big, other mothers' lives are worthless?"

I struggled furiously. Harrison, in a fit of rage, slapped me twice across the face.

Blood trickled from the corner of my mouth. No one raised a hand to wipe it away.

Nana Rose stood by, listening to the frantic beep-beep-beep of the alarms, acting as if she heard nothing.

Seeing my gaze fixed on her, she sighed lightly.

"Veronica is different from you. She can't handle pain."

I looked down at the amniotic fluid flooding the bed, my eyes reddening.

So, I can?

The bodyguards didn't let go.

Until, three minutes later, a group of people burst into the delivery room.

The police were with them.

"We received a report. This hospital is engaging in malpractice. We need to transfer this patient immediately!"

The police quickly secured the scene.

The chaotic delivery room fell into a stunned silence.

When Harrison saw the doctors from the rival hospital checking my vitals, he stepped angrily in front of me.

"Sarah! Do you want our family on the front page of every tabloid?!"

"Stop this nonsense! Give me your phone and record a clarification video right now!"

Just then, my mother, the head nurse, walked in upon hearing the commotion. There were still bloodstains on her white coat.

Seeing my body convulsing and my face devoid of color, she asked with concern, "Did the hospital make a mistake in the scheduling? Why are there outside experts here?"

My father charged in right after her, furious. He threw my broken phone onto my chest.

"The hospital is undergoing its accreditation review! You know that! Are you trying to cause a medical scandal?!"

"How cruel can you be? Veronica needs her parents' warmth right now, yet you force us to come here to deal with you!"

My mother saw the blood on my forehead and reached out to wipe it, but Harrison pushed her hand away. "This is all a show she directed herself. She wants sympathy to gain leverage."

Mom muttered a few more words to me, but after receiving an urgent page from the operating room, she dragged Dad away and rushed out.

I struggled to sit up, pointing a trembling finger at Harrison. "He blocked my treatment the entire time! Arrest him!"

The doctor from the rival hospital saw I was bleeding profusely. He shoved Harrison aside and opened his medical kit to bandage me.

With the police watching, Harrison couldn't get physical. Instead, he pulled out his phone and recorded the rival doctor treating me.

He sneered. "Entering an operating room without scrubbing in? You're a hack. Wait for the lawsuit!"

Harrison forwarded the video directly to the hospital board right in front of us, demanding they file a report immediately.

Terrified, I called out to the System in my mind.

"Host, rest assured. The team filed all necessary paperwork before arrival. The outcome will not be affected."

Relieved, I murmured, "When does the liquidation begin?"

The System didn't reply, but Harrison caught the tail end of my whisper. He pointed at me, enraged.

"What liquidation?! Who are you liquidating?!"

The doctor finished bandaging me and stared at the latest test results, stunned.

"The fetal heart rate dropped three times in the last hour! Preeclampsia is setting in. She's in critical condition. We need to move her to surgery now!"

Harrison didn't care. He blocked the gurney.

"Taking her away won't help. If I don't sign, no one dares to operate on her!"

The doctor grabbed the diagnostic report and showed it to the police. Finally, with my consent, they pushed me out of the delivery room.

I felt fluid leaking continuously from my lower body. I grabbed the doctor's sleeve.

My mother, who had been signing papers nearby, saw the blood soaking my pants. She covered her mouth, her eyes tearing up.

"You... it's this serious? You need a C-section immediately!"

Harrison, who had been blocking my exit, recoiled in shock when he saw the blood-soaked bed.

Mom held my hand, whispering comfort. "I'll arrange an operating room for you right now!"

My eyes were red as I gripped her wrist. "I have something to tell you."

Just then, the doors to the other operating room opened. Veronica was wheeled out.

Harrison immediately grabbed a bouquet of flowers and rushed over, shouting, "You did great, honey!"

Dad rushed forward too, carrying two bags of luxury goods. Listening to the family's joyous celebration, I couldn't help but speak up.

"Can I go in for surgery now?"

Harrison walked closer, holding a baby boy, his face twisted in disgust.

"Your sister just came out of surgery. The family is gathering around to say a few words. Do you have to be such a killjoy?"

The nurse pushed Veronica’s gurney in front of me. She looked at me twice, then handed me a red woven bracelet.

"Harrison prayed for this specifically before the birth. I'm passing my good luck to you."

I let out a cold laugh and refused it.

Veronica’s eyes instantly reddened. She reached out and tugged at my sleeve. "Is my little sister blaming me? In that situation just now, I really had no choice. The doctor said I needed surgery immediately."

Before I could speak, the relatives Harrison had kept waiting nearby rushed over with gifts.

Seeing my dark expression toward Veronica, they voiced their dissatisfaction.

"Sarah, you're both mothers now. Your sister just finished surgery. Isn't your attitude a bit excessive?"

Seeing this, Veronica started to cry.

"Don't blame Sarah. It's my fault for taking the operating room without asking her. Please don't be mad at her; it's bad for the baby."

In the three months since she returned, she had outwardly defended me at every turn. She even insisted on taking the nanny's room opposite mine, claiming sisters should be close.

But behind the scenes, anything I looked at, she would buy at double the price.

Then she would fake a smile and say, "Dad told the sales clerk to save the good stuff for me. If you like it, I'll give it to you."

I snorted and shook off her hand, my tone icy.

"Move! I need to give birth!"

Unexpectedly, Harrison grabbed my wrist, forcing me to stop. "Apologize to Veronica. Now!"

"Harrison!" Veronica’s voice trembled. "Let her go have the baby!"

Harrison patted her hand gently to comfort her, but when he turned back to me, his eyes were cold.

He enunciated every word. "Sarah, you must apologize to Veronica today. Otherwise, you aren't going anywhere."

I was shaking from the pain. The contractions in my lower abdomen were coming in rapid waves.

But Harrison stood before me like a mountain, with no intention of moving.

The surrounding relatives accused me of being immature and willful.

I finally snapped.

"Harrison King, so you would rather see me and the baby die than forgo this apology, is that it?"

Harrison stepped forward, grabbing my hair and forcing my head up. "I don't want to say it a second time!"

The police finally stepped in to control the situation. The monitors beside the bed began to scream their alarms.

My consciousness started to blur.

I looked at the time. Soon. Five more minutes and I could leave this world completely.

Now, all I needed was a push.

Fighting through the agony, I ripped the sensors off my body and threw them aside, screaming. "I'm not giving birth! You want me dead? Fine! I'll die for you right now!"

The doctor from the rival hospital saw me giving up and rushed to persuade me.

"Don't be foolish! Your life matters. If the hospital cooperates, we can start surgery in ten minutes."

Harrison exploded in rage. He picked up the monitor and smashed it onto the floor, pointing at me and cursing. "You shrew! What? You want to take revenge on us and extort money?!"

The faces of the relatives instantly changed.

Mom, having arranged the operating room, stopped in her tracks upon hearing this, looking at me in disbelief.

"Sarah, why must you always compete with Veronica? She is different from you."

I laughed out loud, my vision blurring into vague shapes.

"Yes, I'm just the fake heiress! I’ll give my life back to you!"

Harrison sneered. "Mom, Dad, let's take Veronica back to the ward first. If she wants to throw a tantrum, let her."

The System’s voice echoed in my mind again.

"Host blood loss indicators have reached the agreed value. Detach immediately?"

I murmured a response. "Immediately."

The next second, I let out a pained scream and completely passed out.

The doctor looked at the heart monitor and panicked.

"The patient has lost vital signs!"
