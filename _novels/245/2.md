My daughter and I had become accustomed to Chadwick's rage.

Lily clumsily ladled a bowl of soup and respectfully handed it to Aaliyah, but she didn't take it.

Aaliyah scooped a spoonful of curry for me.

"Pregnant women should have more supplements. It's also because I have rhinitis and can't stand the smell on your body, that's why Chad gets so angry."

Looking at the curry in front of me, my stomach churned.

My morning sickness was already bad, and this month I couldn't bear any heavy flavors.

When I hesitated, Aaliyah stomped hard on my foot under the table, and glanced smugly at my daughter.

Lily's hand holding the soup was scalded red.

I could only endure the discomfort and drink that spoonful of curry.

Only then did Aaliyah take the bowl of soup with satisfaction.

"As the eldest sister-in-law, you make Aaliyah serve you food, you really are a good daughter-in-law of our Shen household!"

Chadwick snorted coldly at me.

"Evelyn is pregnant, she should be taken care of."

"Aaliyah, you're just too kind."

He stroked Aaliyah's head dotingly.

Then he pointed to several dishes of African cuisine on the table and instructed:

"This is African royal cuisine made for you by Aaliyah herself. If you don't know what's good for you and deliberately don't finish it, then don't eat at all in the future!"

...

In the middle of the night, my daughter vomited and had diarrhea.

"Ah... Mom... Mom, it hurts..."

She mumbled a few words.

Her uncomfortable appearance made my heart feel like it was being twisted into a ball.

I wiped the cold sweat from her forehead. "Baby, be good, Mommy's here."

To cater to Aaliyah's eating habits, all the water in the house was replaced with a cooling system.

I had no choice but to boil hot water myself.

At this time, she was already burning hot.

And because she was so uncomfortable, her mouth was bitten through.

The sound of boiling water woke Aaliyah.

She quickly stepped forward, grabbed her daughter's ear and pulled her off the wheelchair.

"No wonder she is a little bitch born from a slut, so many things, I can not even get my beauty sleep well."

"Don't!"

I leaned forward to stop her, but accidentally fell to the ground.

My daughter was still curled up, hugging her abdomen.

"I beg you Aaliyah, even if you just let Lily drink a mouthful of hot water, okay?"

"I was wrong, I shouldn't have offended you, I'm willing to do anything you want me to do."

Aaliyah showed a dangerous smile,

"Really? Then kneel here and massage me until dawn."

She dragged our mother and daughter into the master bedroom, with red lace panties stained with traces hanging on the doorknob.

I bit my lip and looked away.

After drinking hot water, my daughter finally felt better, but Aaliyah still made her lie on the cold floor.

Aaliyah suddenly became interested in looking at the daughter on the ground.

"In our African country, children only need to drink the blood of nobles when they are sick, and they will be safe all their lives."

She cut open her wrist with a knife, and said condescendingly:

"I will bestow it on her today."

But I clearly saw some red rashes on her legs and wrists just now, and some of them were broken.

There was also a wound on the corner of her daughter's mouth, and a terrible thought appeared in my mind.

Without thinking, I hugged her leg,

"Let me drink, let me drink, Lily is still young, I beg you..."

"Hahaha!" Aaliyah laughed, "Rural uncivilized woman, ignorant and uncultured, fighting to drink human blood."

She pressed her bleeding wrist against my mouth.

Suddenly, with a "bang," Chadwick broke into the door.
