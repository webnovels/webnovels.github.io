"My first trip to Southeast Asia was a disaster.

I got drugged and sold to a gambling ring.

Then, I was given as a prize fighter's trophy to some mob boss's son.

My life turned into a living hell.

I knelt before a golden Buddha, praying for all those who wronged me to rot in hell.

Ironically, the devil himself, dressed in red robes and fingering prayer beads, stood beside me.

He stared at the Buddha with utter disrespect.

""Money and power are the only things that can save you here,"" he said.

He looked down at me, arrogance radiating from him.

""Praying to me is more effective than praying to Buddha,"" he continued. ""I can make your wishes come true.""

At that moment, I understood.

When law and religion fail, money and power rule."
