I had been pretending to be good by Lucas Foster's side for four years.

Four years ago, when the video of Natalie Nelson killing my sister in a car accident was exposed, my boyfriend Charlie West hired a top lawyer for her, helping her clear her name. When I was left alone and helpless, it was Natalie's stepbrother, Lucas Foster, who stepped up and chose justice over family ties.

He found a lawyer for me, collected evidence and witness testimonies everywhere, and finally sent Natalie to prison. When the dust settled, Lucas proposed to me, and I agreed.

But in our fourth year of marriage, I saw a birthday wish from Natalie in Lucas's email. It was accompanied by a happy selfie of her on the beach. The date in the bottom right corner of the photo was yesterday.

[Happy birthday, bro!]

[Claire Hayes's heart has been with me for four years now, with no adverse reactions. Thanks to you and Charlie, I've been given a new lease on life.]

[It's just a pity that you have to be forced to stay with Chloe to keep her from causing trouble.]

Lucas's reply was: [As long as you're happy, I'm willing to do anything, sis.]

After reading this, I smiled brightly. These three murderers still want happiness? After four years, their time is up!
