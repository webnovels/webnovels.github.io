After Veronica abused me for the 98th time, all for Marcus, my spirit was utterly crushed. That’s when I finally gave in to Genevieve Thorne's relentless pursuit.

After a passionate night with Genevieve, she promised to help me fake my death, so I could start a new life with her, marry her abroad.

I swallowed the faux-death drug she gave me, only to wake up too soon, trapped inside my own coffin.

My body was paralyzed, but I could hear Genevieve talking to someone just outside.

“Ms. Thorne, you had Veronica abuse Adrian, then pretended to be his savior. You’ve completely won his trust. Why arrange a fake death and burial now?”

“Only then will the Sterlings believe he’s dead. Marcus’s position as heir will be secure, and no one will ever bring up him being illegitimate again.”

The other person hesitated. “Won’t seven days be too long, waiting until your wedding with Marcus before digging him out?”

“The faux-death drug lasts for five days. I’ve already had water, food, and an oxygen tank placed inside the coffin. He won’t die.”
