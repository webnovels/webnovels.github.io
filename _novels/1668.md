My wife personally butchered my million-dollar racehorse to make a meal for her intern.
That male intern, Leo Dubois, was devouring the exotic dish with gusto, not forgetting to post a video bragging about it.
"Huge thanks to my amazing boss! Just tasted a champion racehorse delicacy. Absolutely delicious~"
In the background, Scarlett Hayes's voice offered instructions.
"The choicest cuts are the most tender. It's best if you carve them out just before the horse is completely gone…"
My hands trembled with rage. I immediately shot Scarlett a message.
"Get Leo to kneel before me in an hour, or face the consequences."
Scarlett didn't reply.
As the countdown ended, a hundred police officers stormed into the banquet hall.
Leo, still with grease on his lips, was slammed onto the kitchen counter by a cop.

"Alex Thorne! How dare you call the police?!"
Scarlett kicked open the door. A bloody horse's head landed at my feet, instantly soaking my pants.
Blaze's eyes were cloudy, yet still stared at me with an unseeing accusation.
"It's just a horse? Here, I'll give it back!"
I curved my lips into a cruel smile, my eyes icy.
"Then what if I chop your little plaything into pieces and give him back to you? Would that be alright?"
"Leo is just a recent grad!"
Scarlett's pupils constricted, and she pointed a furious finger at my nose.
"For a stupid horse, you ruined his life with a criminal record, and now you want to destroy him completely?"
"Alex, how can you be so vicious?!"
Three years married, and we'd never once had a real fight. Now, she was calling me vicious, for a complete stranger.
My gaze sharpened. I stared at her, enunciating each word.
"Section 275 of the Criminal Code: intentional destruction of property exceeding half a million dollars…"
"Scarlett, you're a lawyer, you know this statute better than anyone, don't you?"
Scarlett flinched, then suddenly grabbed the ashtray from the table and hurled it at me.
I dodged, and the wedding photo I'd spent three months painting was smashed, leaving a gaping hole in the wall.
"There are hundreds of other horses in your stable! What's wrong with letting Leo try something new?!"
As she mentioned him, a flicker of pained anger colored her eyes.
"He's a French international student, left home for four years, all he wanted was to taste a truly authentic horse meat dish!"
"As his boss, is it wrong for me to just want to take care of him a little more?"
I scoffed, "Take care of him?"
"Thousands of international students come here every year. Why does your generosity only apply to him?"
"Anyone who didn't know better would think you two have been sleeping together behind my back…"
Scarlett's lips trembled, and it took her a long moment to force out a reply through gritted teeth.
"Alex, you're absolutely impossible!"
I sneered, opening Leo's social media and thrusting it in front of her.
"Last year on my birthday, you lied and said you were on a business trip. And what really happened?"
"You splurged millions, booking a five-star hotel to celebrate Leo's dog's birthday!"
Scarlett's furious expression instantly dissolved into guilt.
"That was our dog, the one we adopted together. It was his first birthday, I couldn't possibly miss it…"
"Are you really jealous of a dog? Is that necessary?"
Her absurd logic left me speechless. I swiped to the next post.
"A kiss from Scarlett makes the boo-boo disappear!"
The accompanying photo showed Scarlett carefully applying ointment to a tiny cut on his fingertip, by his hospital bed.
"He got a little scratch from a rose, and you stayed up two days and two nights to care for him."
"I was in the hospital with a bleeding ulcer after covering for you at that client event, and you just said you were 'busy with work,' then gave me a bowl of oatmeal and dismissed me."
"Scarlett, do you even remember who your husband is?"
She bit her lip, stubbornly trying to defend herself.
"So many people are trying to suck up to you, do you really need my little bit of attention? Unlike Leo, he's all alone in this country, with no one but me to count on…"
Listening to her blatant favoritism, my heart turned to ice, inch by agonizing inch.
Seeing my silence, she stepped forward, tugging at my sleeve, her tone softening slightly.
"Alex, please, let go of this thing with Leo."
"Absolutely not!" I coldly shook her off.
"Either he rots in jail, or he pays up and gets out of the country. If I find out you're secretly helping him get away, then we're getting a divorce."
Her face went pale, and she retreated a step, disbelief in her eyes.
"For this little thing, you're threatening me with divorce?"
"It's not a threat. It's a notification."
With that, I ignored her hysterical outburst, picked up the horse's head at my feet, and walked out.
