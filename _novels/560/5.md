When consciousness returned, both my hands were wrapped in thick, white bandages. The pain had dulled to a throb.

Mr. Henderson, our old butler, was standing by the bed, his eyes filled with sorrow.

"Madam, you're finally awake. I'll go inform the master."

"No need." I managed a weak smile, my voice hoarse as if sandpaper had scraped it.

"These hands, he destroyed them."

Mr. Henderson's body stiffened, his face etched with incredulity.

"How could... the master used to not even let you clip your own nails, fearing the scissors would harm you..."

Tears finally streamed uncontrollably from my eyes.

Yes, the whole world knew he once cherished me.

But why, after being reborn, was that deep affection completely gone?

It didn't matter now, anyway.

The agreement was signed; soon, I'd be completely free of him.

Thinking that I would leave soon, I had to say goodbye to Grandpa Arthur, no matter what.

As soon as I entered, I saw him leaning on the couch, looking unwell.

"Grandpa, Dax and I... are separating."

Noticing the pain in my voice, Grandpa Arthur sighed deeply and patted my hand: "Never mind, that boy doesn't have the good fortune. Even if I die, I'll never let that kind of woman into my family's home!"

My nose stung. In my past life, Grandpa Arthur protected me just the same way.

"Grandpa, it's time for your blood pressure medicine." I stood up. "I'll get it from the next room for you."

When I returned with the medicine, I was about to knock, but heard a muffled groan from inside through the door crack.


Pushing the door open, I saw Seraphina standing in front of Grandpa Arthur, a pillow on the floor.

The old man's wizened hands hung limply, he was close to suffocating.

"Let him go!" I pushed her away like a madwoman. Grandpa Arthur was breathing weakly, his eyes rolled back.

"Help! Call a doctor, fast!"

My scream drew everyone's attention.

Dax's face changed instantly at the sight: "Grandpa!"

He roughly pushed me aside and rushed out, carrying Grandpa.

Inside the recovery room, Dax looked at us, his face grim. "Tell me, what happened?"

"It was Elara!" Seraphina shrieked, pointing at me. "I saw her smother Grandpa with a pillow!"

"She... she was trying to harm Grandpa! I tried to stop her, but she tried to attack me too..."

Dax's gaze was like ice: "Grandpa treated you like his own granddaughter. How could you do such a thing?"
