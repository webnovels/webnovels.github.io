I pushed the door open completely and walked in.

At the sound, he glared at me, annoyed.

"Why didn't you knock?"

I didn't understand his question. I flung the divorce papers at his feet.

"Sign it."

He was perhaps eager to return to their interrupted spectacle. He snatched the pen without even looking at the document.

He scribbled his name carelessly. His hormones were clearly dictating his actions.

I picked up the agreement and turned to leave, without a single shred of regret.

Half an hour later, I had just stepped out of the villa's front door.

A Rolls-Royce pulled up directly in front of me, blocking my path.

The window rolled down. Seraphina, the dancer, sat in the back, greeting me.

"Elara, where are you going? Dax is taking me to the 'Black Orchid' private auction tonight to bid on a dance outfit. Want to come along?"

"No." My voice was cold.

Seraphina's eyes instantly welled up: "Elara, do you hate me?!"

"Elara," Dax's voice was icy, devoid of any emotion. "Seraphina is kindly inviting you. Don't be ungrateful."

In the end, I was shoved into the back seat of that car.

The auction house was set up in a private estate.

Dax was incredibly generous, bidding on a performance outfit worn by the famous star Lady Gaga for Seraphina, drawing gasps of admiration from the crowd.

The auctioneer cleared his throat, his voice carrying a hint of mystery: "The next item up for bid is somewhat special. It's an original, never-before-seen copy of a video. The protagonist is a rising star in the dance world. Starting bid, five million."

A highly intimate video of Seraphina and her ex-boyfriend flashed across the large screen. The entire room erupted in uproar!

The high-definition footage, amplified gasps, made every explicit detail excruciatingly clear.

"What a figure, truly explosive..."

"Those twin peaks, I'd love to play with them. Must feel great."

Lewd laughter from men, mixed with women's gasps and disdain, instantly exploded into chaos.

Seraphina's face went ashen. She pointed at the screen, trembling uncontrollably: "It's not me! That's not me!"

Suddenly, she spun towards me, tears streaming down her face: "Elara! Can you really not tolerate me?! Did you have to use such a low-down trick to ruin me?!"

With that, she sobbed, covered her face, and ran out.

Dax's eyes darkened. He stood up, his voice low, yet it made the entire room dead silent.

"This video, and all its backups, sent to my office within an hour. One second late,"

He scanned the room, "I promise you, no one in this room will see the sun tomorrow."

Then, he turned and stared at me: "Elara, you'd better pray this has nothing to do with you."
