In the seventh year of my secret crush on Jasper, I ended up marrying him. On our wedding night, he handed me a divorce agreement. "

After a year, we'll go our separate ways peacefully," he said, glancing at my lace nightgown with a slight smile. "

Miss Adeline, is there something on your mind?"

When the year was up, I asked, "When are we going to the civil affairs bureau?" He acted as if he didn't hear me. "Who was that guy earlier?"

 I laughed and replied, "Mr. Lu, is something on your mind?"
