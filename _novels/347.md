I got canned from my job, so I packed my bags and headed back to the sticks, spending my days playing mahjong with Grandma.

Meanwhile, my whole family was freaking out, searching high and low for me.

Turns out, my genius jewelry designer sister couldn't sketch a thing after I left.

Last time around, at the National Jewelry Design Competition, my little sister always managed to whip up designs that were carbon copies of mine, but, like, five minutes sooner.

Everyone accused me of plagiarism, and my own family jumped on the bandwagon to testify against me.

The company decided I was a liability, a copycat ruining their reputation, so they handed me a pink slip and a bill for damages.

My family treated me like dead weight, kicking me to the curb.

The weight of their betrayal and public shame crushed me, and I spiraled into depression. I ended up getting mowed down by one of my sister's crazed fans while walking down the street.

Before blacking out, I couldn't figure out how my sister always got her hands on my designs first.

Then, bam! I woke up, back to the day before the National Jewelry Design Competition.
