I once overheard our son talking to Adrian.

The 5-year-old was innocent yet sensitive, asking Adrian if he wasn't behaving well enough.

"Why doesn't mommy like me? Is it because I'm not obedient?"

Adrian held him on his lap, gently stroking his face.

"Maybe... it's because you look too much like daddy."

When I went downstairs, our son had just walked in. Seeing me, his eyes lit up, but he only inched cautiously towards me.

"Mommy..."

His gaze kept scanning me until it suddenly fell on the bruise on my forehead from being hit. His eyes widened and he rushed over without hesitation.

"Mommy, what happened to your head?"

"I accidentally bumped my head. Have you been good at kindergarten this week?"

Looking at his cautious demeanor, I couldn't help but reach out to wipe the sweat from his forehead.

Our son was visibly startled, but still nuzzled my hand obediently.

"I've been good. I even got a gold star from the teacher."

The housekeeper watched us nervously and carefully approached.

"Young master, why don't we go play with your toys instead of bothering mommy?"

Our son looked at me reluctantly, clearly not wanting to leave, but still let go of my hand.

We rarely had intimate moments. In the past, I had mixed feelings of love and hate towards this child. But now I just wanted to make it up to him.

"Am I not allowed to talk to my own son?" I raised an eyebrow at the housekeeper, who flinched and immediately backed away.

It seems my past crazy behavior in the villa had left quite an impression, making everyone in the house wary of me.

Only my son looked at me in confusion, his chubby little hands fidgeting with his clothes. After a while, I finally heard his tentative voice.

"Mommy, do you want to see my gold star?"

I finally noticed the gold star he was holding and nodded immediately. Seeing his face light up with a smile, he happily placed the star in my palm.

"It's beautiful. My baby is so clever."

Everyone looked at me in shock. My son was so excited he couldn't speak.

For the whole day, my son played nearby, not too close but not too far, glancing at me from time to time.

Finally, I couldn't resist patting my lap.

"Do you want to sit on mommy's lap and play?"

My son stood up, looked at his toy thoughtfully for a while, then smiled brightly and ran over to me happily.

He sat in my lap very obediently, looking up at my expression every so often while playing.

"Mommy, do you want to play with the toys? Or read a storybook?"

Behind the well-behaved child was a long-term lack of maternal love. He was always cautious, afraid of angering me.

My heart melted at the sight. I pulled my son close and hugged him tightly.

"It's okay, sweetie. From now on, mommy will do whatever you want to do with you."
