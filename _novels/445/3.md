I played with my son all day. By evening, I was unusually tired as soon as my head hit the pillow.

In the middle of the night, I suddenly felt cold next to me. I tried to pull the blanket, but my hand was restrained by something.

A body pressed down on me, so heavy I could barely breathe. I could only groggily open my eyes in my sleepy state.

As soon as I opened my eyes, I met a pair of almond-shaped eyes, instantly captivated.

Adrian was undeniably handsome. This was something I could never deny.

He had alluring almond eyes with a beauty mark below them.

The first time we met, I even wondered if fox spirits really existed in this world.

How else could a man wearing a complex three-piece suit, covered from head to toe, still silently seduce you with just a glance?

"Hazel." He softened his voice, husky and magnetic, as if bewitching me.

"It's been a while. Did you miss me?"

His cold fingers trailed across my face, sliding down my neck, raising goosebumps.

"Let go of my hands first."

My wrists were tied with Adrian's tie. I couldn't move and could only quietly plead with him.

Although Adrian was very tolerant of my tantrums in the villa, smashing glasses and crystal lamps, the truly sick one in our relationship was Adrian.

He had an obsessive disorder, never letting go of things he was fixated on. He was sensitive, suspicious, and extremely possessive.

Once, after arguing with Adrian due to Rachel's instigation, I was directly locked up in the villa by him.

"Baby, I don't want to do this either. But once I let you go, who knows where you'll run off to."

He caressed my face with one hand while skillfully unbuttoning my clothes with the other.

Adrian's body temperature was always low. As soon as he touched me, I felt a chill.

"I really won't run away. It's uncomfortable being tied up like this."

Adrian ignored my words. Only after we were done did he finally release me. I was exhausted and could only lie panting in bed.

He gently massaged my hands. I managed to open my eyes and saw Adrian kneeling by the bed, intently focused on my hands, his movements becoming increasingly gentle.

"What do you want to say to me?"

Adrian met my gaze, his eyes filled with complex emotions.

"You suddenly messaged me. What did you want to discuss? Letting you leave? I've said before that I won't agree..."

For once, I argued with Adrian. Using my last bit of strength, I sat up and threw myself into his arms.

Adrian was clearly stunned, his body stiffening. He just tightly wrapped his arms around me.

I was too tired to talk to Adrian and fell fast asleep.

When I woke up the next morning, I heard soft voices outside the door.

"Is mommy still not awake? She said she'd have breakfast with me today."

"Mommy is very tired and needs to rest."

My son fell silent. Through the door crack, I saw him sit down on the floor.

"Then I'll wait here for mommy. This way she'll see me when she wakes up."

Genetics truly are a mysterious thing. Not only did my son look similar to Adrian, sometimes his stubbornness was exactly the same.

I softly called out "baby", and hearing my voice, my son immediately got up and rushed towards the room.

"Good morning, mommy."

Yesterday's interactions had broken down the barriers between us. My son happily pounced in front of me, his chubby little hands holding mine.

Adrian stood at the bedroom door, looking at me with a complex expression.

He had tried every way to please me before, even begging me not to leave on his knees.

Every time he got close, it only triggered greater disgust from me.

So Adrian got used to standing at a distance, just awkwardly staring at me.

Well, the best way to deal with an awkward person is to be direct.

I looked at Adrian and smiled.

"Good morning, hubby."


On Saturday morning, because of that one "hubby", Adrian accidentally knocked over two water glasses. By the third time, I finally couldn't hold back.

"If you don't like it, I won't call you that anymore in the future."

"I do like it!"

Good, this time he denied it faster than anyone.

At the dining table, the housekeeper brought today's breakfast.

I met the housekeeper's gaze. The moment our eyes met, she instinctively avoided it.

"Mrs. Wood, how long have you been working in this house?"

"Almost ten years. I used to work at the old mansion, but came here after the master married you."
