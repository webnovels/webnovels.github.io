After being hit on the head by a book that fell from the sky, a new set of memories appeared in my mind.

Because of these memories, my obsession with my first love completely vanished.

When I woke up, I was still a bit dazed, thinking I was cramped in a dark, damp basement, waking up every day worrying about how to make money, or else I'd be homeless the next day.

I looked around the room - it was luxuriously decorated, with everything arranged according to my preferences.

The extra memories were so vivid, as if heaven was deliberately reminding me.

If I remained stubborn and unrepentant, I would end up in a miserable situation in the future.

I pulled back the curtains and saw a large field of roses. My husband Adrian had hired professional gardeners to plant them. The entire villa's decor, down to every flower in the garden, was designed based on my preferences.

But in the past, I saw it as a beautiful cage.

I opened my phone and, unsurprisingly, there were many messages from my best friend Rachel.

We had originally planned to go out three days ago, but I was knocked unconscious by the falling book right before leaving, so the plan fell through.

"Hazel, did Adrian lock you up at home again? He's such a psycho. I'll definitely help you escape. Jack is still waiting for you."

I couldn't help but laugh. She called Adrian a psycho, but she used all sorts of tricks to seduce him after I left.

And Jack, my first love who was supposedly waiting for me, had already dated countless women abroad.

In the new memories, I used suicide to force Adrian to divorce me. He was left scarred and broken, but still willing to give me most of his assets.

Unfortunately, that money was quickly swindled away by Jack.

It was only then that I realized everything had been fake.

...

I hadn't responded to Rachel for three days, and she was clearly getting anxious. She kept sending messages, trying to drive a wedge between Adrian and me, while painting Jack as deeply in love with me.

"Adrian is coming back from abroad in two days. You'll really have no chance after that."

Adrian's whereabouts were always kept secret, yet she even knew when he was returning.

It seems Rachel had quite a few spies around Adrian.

I pondered for a moment, then opened my chat with Adrian. All the messages were from him, ranging from daily greetings to itinerary updates.

But I had never replied.

The last message was from last night. Adrian said his flight had been rescheduled and he would be back today.

In the past, I would have gotten a headache seeing this message.

But at this moment, I suddenly felt an overwhelming longing for my husband.

"Okay, I'll wait for you to come back. Be careful on the way."

Just after I sent the message, there was a sudden commotion downstairs. A car had stopped at the entrance of the estate.

A 5-year-old boy got out of the car, wearing a kindergarten backpack and holding something in his hand.

As he walked into the estate, everyone he passed stopped to greet him.

Because he was Adrian's and my child.

The child who looked 80% like Adrian, so I had never liked him.
