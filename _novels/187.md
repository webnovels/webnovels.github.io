"Nathan, are you really going to divorce Olivia and study abroad?"

In the quiet living room, Nathan looked at Mrs. Sullivan's shocked face across from him and nodded.

"Yes, Mrs. Sullivan. As you know, I wasn't the one who was supposed to marry her in the first place. For Olivia, I was just an unexpected stand-in, a substitute when the real groom didn't show up. Now that he's back, she's been so happy lately. It's time for me to go."

Outside, a light snow was falling, creating a beautiful winter scene.

He smiled lightly. "Studying abroad has always been my dream anyway."
