I slowly walked to the emcee's platform and took the microphone from the bewildered MC.

"Everyone, it seems today's engagement party will have an added show."

"Adeline!"

Jasper urgently let go of Phoebe, "Let me explain, I was drunk last night and mistook Phoebe for you..."

"Really?"

I opened my phone, "Then on the 15th of last month, room 2808 at the Hilton Hotel, did you mistake someone then too?"

The large screen suddenly lit up, playing a high-definition video—

Jasper was holding Phoebe's waist as they entered the elevator, kissing eagerly, and Phoebe even provocatively made a V-sign at the camera.

The date was clearly displayed: 23 days ago.

"No! This can't be!"

Phoebe screamed and lunged at the control panel, then turned to me, "Sister, you misunderstood! It's fake!"

I easily sidestepped and pressed play on the recording pen pinned to my skirt—

"Jasper, I don't want you to marry my sister, when will we..."

Phoebe's voice was sickeningly sweet, and the moans made one's blood boil.

"Don't worry, she's not as good as you, really a waste of a pretty face, our Phoebe is better~"

"The kind that... can't be detected."

The moans rose higher and higher, and the children in the room had already been taken away by their elders when the video started.

The faint sounds were abruptly cut off.

The room was dead silent.

"What misunderstanding? That you're calling me sister while climbing into my fiancé's bed?"

I wanted to laugh out loud.

Jasper's face was ashen: "Adeline, were you monitoring me?"

"Monitoring?"

I threw the engagement ring at his face, "I was afraid of dying for no reason!"

I sneered inside.

In my past life, they had imprisoned me in a mental hospital, forcing me to listen to this pair of scum flaunt their deeds.

Things like "I had him before your engagement~"

Or "We pick a hotel on the 15th of every month~"

Or "Even though I promised Jasper to hold back at the engagement party, I just couldn't help it~"

Or "Sister, everything you have is inferior to me~ I want you to live in my shadow forever~"

Jasper would only fondly tap Phoebe's nose while laughing at my drug-induced torment.

"You were impulsive at the engagement party, but fortunately, we convinced Mrs. Anderson to switch people on the spot."

"Indeed, who cares about alliances in the face of benefits, honey, luckily it was you~"

The two shamelessly performed their live show in front of me, and just recalling it made me sick.

"Trash matches scum, I wish you both an eternal bond."

By this time, my mother was already furious, and my father swung his fist at Jasper's head.

"I gave you face and you want to sleep with my precious one!"

Jasper was so frightened by the fierce punch that he instinctively dodged.

My father, even angrier, grabbed his collar and punched him again.

Tears welled up in my eyes, not everything is about interests.

My parents weren't.

It was they who wanted to estrange me from my parents before I died.

In my past life, I was enraged by Phoebe's act of snatching my fiancé, and the mocking and ridiculing eyes from so many people.

Having always been smooth sailing, I covered my face and went to the bathroom to fix my makeup.

My pride wouldn't allow me to want something used, even if...

This person was my beloved childhood sweetheart.

But I fainted in the bathroom and woke up to be told the engagement party was over.

The alliance partner was not me.

The engagement party, broadcast live, had me mocked to no end.

Comments like "Anderson's young lady is nothing special" were unbearable.

My mother visited once when I first woke up.

"Adeline, Jasper is not your soulmate."

My conversation with my parents ended with that sentence.

Afterwards, there was no word from them.

Watching my parents rage and beating Phoebe and Jasper, I suddenly understood.

It was their scheme.

This time, I didn't play into their hands, didn't beg, didn't plead, and didn't have any ridiculous infatuation.
