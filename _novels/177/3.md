"Adeline, trust me once! I really know I'm wrong!"

Jasper, being beaten, desperately grabbed my hand, his face bruised and swollen, pleading with me.

The Harris family also realized what was happening and began to urge me.

I knew I was susceptible to this.

My usually gentle and elegant parents had their lips tightly pressed; they knew I liked Jasper, liked him dearly.

They feared I would soften and plead.

I raised my lips and slapped him backhanded.

"Slap!"

The crisp sound echoed throughout the banquet hall.

Jasper's face turned to the side, and another red mark appeared on his face.

"Jasper, Mr. Harris,"

I sneered, shaking off my numb hand, "Do you think I'm still as stupid as before?"

I took out my phone and pulled up the bank statements: "In the past three months, what you've embezzled from Anderson Corporation..."

"Adeline!"

Several voices drowned out my next words.

Luke Aiden's rebuke, Jasper's interruption, and Phoebe's shame and anger.

Luke Aiden was the first to react, slamming the table and questioning: "Adeline! Are you trying to ruin the cooperation between our two families?"

I paused for a moment, and Luke Aiden was satisfied with my reaction, bringing all the business pressure onto me.

"Miss Anderson,"

Luke Aiden's face was dark, his voice low, "It's normal for young people to have conflicts, why be so aggressive?"

Jasper understood, limping to turn off the screen, then confessing.

"Adeline, today is our engagement day, I know I'm wrong, give me another chance."

The face Jasper wore made me sick.

My mind whirled, my gaze meeting my mother's wink.

A childhood signal, whenever this happened, my father would lose the game.

I smiled inside, my parents were supporting me.

They wanted to see my performance, they were willing to back me up.

I had a plan, and instead of looking at Jasper, I stared directly at Luke Aiden.

"Uncle Aiden, your son slept with my foster sister, and you call this 'a little conflict'?"

Jasper limped over to switch off the big screen, then turned to seek forgiveness.

"Adeline, it's our engagement day. I realize my mistake. Please give me another chance."

Jasper's face was truly unpleasant to behold.

My mind was racing, and I caught my mother giving me a knowing wink.

It was a childhood signal. Every time this happened, my father would inevitably lose the game.

I smiled inwardly; my parents were backing me.

They wanted me to succeed, and they were ready to support me.

Resolute, I ignored Jasper and addressed Mr. Harris directly.

"Uncle Harris, your son slept with my foster sister, and you call that 'a minor disagreement'?"

Mr. Harris's expression grew even darker. "Jasper made a mistake any man might make, but the cooperation between Anderson Corporation and the Harris Family cannot stop. Does your father know you're causing such a scene today?"

He was trying to intimidate me.

I was well-acquainted with Mr. Harris's tactics.

In my previous life, he was the one who orchestrated the downfall of the Anderson Family, step by step.

"Uncle Harris,"

I put on an innocent facade, "I just want some fairness."

"Fairness?"

Mr. Harris sneered, turning to my father, whose clothes were slightly rumpled. "Mr. Anderson, don't forget, the project in the west of the city is still under my control."

He left the sentence unfinished, but I understood, as did everyone present.

It was my father's most crucial project recently, with a significant part of Anderson Corporation’s funds invested.

"And also, last month's loan, the approval materials seem to have some issues..."

My heart sank heavily.

So, the Harris Family had started laying the groundwork this early.

Mr. Harris, seeing his point made, signaled for Jasper to approach and take my hand.

"Get away! Uncle Harris, are you threatening me?"

"Adeline! You don't..." Jasper protested.

"Ha."

My mother, who had been silent, chuckled and clapped.

"What a show, truly a farce. Adeline, come to your mother."

I smiled and lifted my dress as I headed toward my mom.

My mother was a strong woman, with a sharp eye, and she naturally saw through the Harris Family's intentions.

She never thought much of Jasper’s weak methods, and this time it was beyond her expectations.

"Mr. Harris, are you threatening the Anderson and Yin Families?"

My mother was from the Yin Family, a clan that had remained hidden from the world, and today they sent her to congratulate her granddaughter's wedding.

Since she married my father, she had never suffered such humiliation.

She elegantly curved her lips, her eyes filled with coldness.

"Young Mr. Harris, my Adeline has never owed you anything, but you... are ungrateful."

"Phoebe, come here."

Caught off guard, Phoebe trembled as she was brought forward.

Watching this scene, I felt truly delighted.

I didn't mind my parents taking it out on them.

It would be best if this pair were locked away forever.

"Mom."

Phoebe's pitiful voice sounded, and I clearly saw Jasper’s eyes avoidantly shifting.

"Call me aunt, I have only one daughter."

My mother mercilessly stripped away this layer of pretense.

She could love Phoebe, but Phoebe couldn't take it for granted.

After all, Phoebe had always vaguely hinted at Mrs. Anderson's affection for her.

"Tell me, was it Adeline who slandered you on the 15th of last month?"

Before Phoebe could speak, my mother turned to Jasper.

"And you, tell me, where was the mistake in this matter?"

Jasper's lips moved but he didn’t speak, and I chuckled lightly.

How poor my judgment must have been to like this person for over ten years.

Phoebe couldn't sit still. She knew her parents' personalities too well, they were resolute and clear in their likes and dislikes.

Without my mother's affection, she feared she wouldn't survive till tomorrow, with her father being so spineless.

"Auntie, I know I wronged my sister, but Jasper and I... we truly love each other."

Phoebe looked pitiful, evoking sympathy from several men present.

Jasper made his choice, kneeling on the spot and knocking his head twice in front of my parents.

"Uncle, Auntie, I'm the one who was foolish, I'm the one who wronged Adeline." He looked deeply at Phoebe.

"I'm sorry to Phoebe, I want to marry her, please Uncle, Auntie, allow it!"

I watched this play with amusement, wondering if the new couple could go far without financial support.

Phoebe was the daughter of a friend who was abandoned after a friend's accident.

After the accident, my father discussed with my mother to adopt her.

Back then, I was full of hope, looking forward to my new sister's arrival.

I remember the first time I saw her, so small and thin, and took her hand.

But later, why did it turn into self-destructive pleasing of the other?

When did the other gain such control?
