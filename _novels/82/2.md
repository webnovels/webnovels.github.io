Seeing that I hadn't responded for a while, Olivia elbowed me and said coquettishly:

"Mia, I'm talking to you, why aren't you answering! This event will be so fun, let's go together."

Seeing her round chubby face lean in close, I wanted to slap her.

The event she wanted me to attend was a hiking trip organized by the university's outdoor club. It was a big activity.

I remembered that after this trip, my reputation gradually worsened.

It was also during this trip that she fell for James at first sight, but James liked me.

I was socially anxious and shy. James was assigned to the same group as me and took care of me the whole way. He coldly rejected Olivia's flirtations and attempts to get close, which caused Olivia's resentment towards me to fully explode.

"Do we really have to go? You know I don't like these group activities, and it'll probably cost a lot too, right?"

"Come on, come on, it'll be so fun! And this little bit of money is nothing."

Hearing my refusal, Olivia kept whining in my ear, pestering me to agree to go on the trip with her.

She definitely wanted me to go because she wanted to go.

Only when I was by her side could she better highlight her good personality, have me pay for her, and ultimately build up her own good reputation.

"I..."

"Oh come on, my dear Mia, it's settled then. I'm going to sign you up right now."

With that, Olivia turned and ran out of the dorm room.

I curled my lips in a cold smile. She was still as self-centered as before.

"Mia, if you really don't want to go, just cancel the registration early. There's still time before the departure date, it shouldn't be a problem," Emma said after Olivia left.

"Forget it, Olivia will keep bugging me to pay. If I don't go she'll be really annoying."

I smiled lightly as I explained.

I still had to go on this trip. After all, it was a good opportunity to meet James.

In my past life, he was very good to me. Even when my reputation was in tatters, he still ran around explaining things for me.

Now that I've been reborn, I don't want to lose James.
