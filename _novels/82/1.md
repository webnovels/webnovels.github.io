"Mia, let's go to this event together!"

Seeing the smiling, slightly chubby girl in front of me, I realized I had been reborn.

Olivia was my best friend. We grew up in the same orphanage. Later, we were adopted by different families, but reunited again in college.

She had an ordinary appearance and was a bit chubby, but she had always been outgoing and sunny since childhood. I was the opposite - delicate and pretty, tall and slender, but always quiet and reserved.

We were adopted on the same day.

Olivia, with her outgoing personality and sweet talk, was taken by a wealthy merchant couple.

I was adopted by a professor couple.

When we reunited in college, Olivia learned that my adoptive parents never had children of their own. A flash of jealousy crossed her face.

Her adoptive parents had a son seven years younger than her after adopting her, but according to her, she was still the favorite at home.

I was shy and slow to warm up to people, not good at interacting with strangers.

By the end of the first semester of freshman year, I hadn't made a single friend. The only person I could talk to was still just Olivia.

But later, towards the end of the second semester, my reputation started getting worse and worse.

Rumors started spreading around campus about me.

They said I was always getting into luxury cars off campus, going to certain places with different men.

That I bullied classmates behind their backs, insulted teachers, and was close with delinquents off campus.

I tried hard to refute the rumors, but to little effect.

Later, my private photos - changing in the locker room, using the bathroom, showering in the public bathroom...

All those photos were posted online. Nosy netizens dug up my personal information, and even my adoptive parents were affected at the university.

It was all Olivia's doing. She wanted to completely ruin me.

Because of this, I developed severe depression. I was afraid to go out, afraid to go online, afraid to see people...

But my adoptive parents always believed in me. They reported it to the police, hoping to find the source of the rumors and clear my name.

When I got sick and couldn't attend classes, they put aside their work to accompany me and take care of me until my condition improved.

But unexpectedly, when Olivia came to visit me at home and saw how much my adoptive parents cared for me, she was enraged again.

She paid some thugs to kidnap me when I went for a follow-up at the hospital.

In the struggle and shouting, I was accidentally hit on the head by one of the thugs.

Panicking, the two thought I had died on the spot and dumped my body in the river.

Before I completely died, I vaguely heard Olivia muttering to herself:

"We're both orphans, why do you get to live such a happy life?"

"I have a good personality and many talents, why wasn't I the one they took back then?"

"Why did he choose you, a gloomy block of wood, instead of cheerful me when we traveled together?"

"Since he likes your face so much, I'll just destroy it!"

"Mia, I just wanted you to leave them, it's your fault for not listening, so you brought this on yourself. Don't blame me."

So it was all because of Olivia's jealousy.

Jealous that I had adoptive parents who wholeheartedly devoted themselves to me, while she wasn't as happy in the Lu family as she claimed.

Jealous that when she brought me along to travel, I ended up dating the guy she had her eye on.

Now that heaven has given me a chance to start over, I will definitely make Olivia experience everything she tried to do to me!
