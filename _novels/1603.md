As the year ended, my husband, Mark, awarded a million-dollar bonus to his company's top salesperson, Cassandra, taking it directly from our son's medical fund.

When I confronted him, his face was full of impatience.

"What are you complaining about now? It's just a million! That's nothing compared to what Cassandra brings in. You contribute nothing to the company, and you dare question her bonus?"

But those orders came from clients I introduced!

Cassandra ran her hand up Mark's thigh, a mocking smirk on her lips.

"Mark and I are both dedicated to this company. After all, you just live off him now."

I watched them with a cold smile.

Mark never knew that my parents had strongly opposed our marriage years ago. They made a deal with me: if Mark truly loved and valued me for three years, they would accept him.

Clearly, I had lost.

Thinking of my son in the hospital, I pulled out the divorce papers.

You took my son's lifeline. Now my parents will take yours!


When Mark saw the divorce papers, he froze.

"What's this, another mind game? Trying to scare me with divorce?"

Impatiently, he tore the documents to shreds and threw them in my face. A jagged edge caught my cheek, drawing a thin line of blood.

My phone was flooded with their explicit photos and videos. I'd screamed and pleaded with him countless times before. His answer was always the same:

"You're always going to be Mrs. Miller. She's just a bit of fun."

I refused to admit I'd loved the wrong man, so I waited for him to change. But he actually took our son's medical funds to give to his mistress!

He had crossed my line!

"Give the money back! Leo has a matched donor organ, and his surgery can happen tomorrow!"

Mark paused for a moment, then frowned.

"Leo is so young; what's a month or two more? Without Cassandra, there's no company. You wouldn't be living this pampered life as Mrs. Miller, you wouldn't have that million dollars!"

I stared at Mark in disbelief.

Years ago, to help him gain my parents' acceptance sooner, I worked tirelessly, pulling in clients even while heavily pregnant. That's why Leo was born with a rare heart condition. The doctors said he needed a heart transplant before he turned three, or else...

Cassandra rose from the sofa, a triumphant glint in her eyes.

"Scarlett, a housewife like you probably has no idea how much revenue I bring in. That million is rightfully mine."

"Mark and I both came from nothing. How could you raise a child so spoiled, he can't even wait two months? He's nothing like Mark!"

A year ago, Mark hired Cassandra straight out of high school. He said she had the same relentless drive he used to have. They also shared the experience of having abusive fathers. I didn't object. I trained Cassandra and handed her my own client contacts.

Later, to care for my son with his congenital heart condition, I resigned and became a full-time mother.

I never imagined Cassandra would repay me by stealing my husband and stabbing me in the back.

The thought made me slap her across the face.

But in the next second, Mark's palm connected with my cheek, sending me stumbling. My back slammed hard into the corner of the table, and I gasped, a cold sweat breaking out.

Mark helped Cassandra up before even looking at me.

"What's gotten into you? You're being completely unreasonable! Leo is my son too, and I care about him, but the company comes first right now. If Cassandra gets this million, she'll create even more value for the company in the future."

He paused when he saw the slap mark on my face, then spoke, as if granting a favor.

"Alright, you wouldn't understand company matters anyway. Apologize to Cassandra, then get out."

I braced myself against the table, straightened up, and pulled another document from my bag, tossing it at his face.

"Divorce!"
