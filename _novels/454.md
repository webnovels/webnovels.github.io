My dad called me at the classified government agency where I work, telling me to go back home for an arranged date.

The potential match seemed great on paper - not only was he handsome, but also a renowned entrepreneur in the area.

Before I left, my boss specifically instructed the airline to keep my identity confidential.

I boarded the plane at the scheduled time and was about to take my seat when someone suddenly shoved me from behind.

Before I could react, the person arrogantly pulled out a wad of cash.

"I want this seat. Take the money and get lost."

I suppressed my anger and retorted, "This is clearly the seat I reserved in advance. What gives you the right to kick me out?"

Faced with my questioning, the woman looked at me with disdain.

"What gives me the right? I'm Mr. Smith's personal assistant. In Bay City, even the birds in the sky have to answer to the Smith family, got it?"

I was stunned for a few seconds, then took out my phone and called my potential fiancé.

"I heard from your company that the Smith family can do whatever they want in Bay City. Is that true?"
