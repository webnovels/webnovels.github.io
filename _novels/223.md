The day I was taken into the operating room, my family and boyfriend were all with my adoptive sister, watching her competition. 

That day, my surgery had complications. 

The tumor in my brain was removed, but my nerves were damaged.

 I lost the ability to feel emotions like a normal person.

I had a tumor in my brain. I initially wanted to tell my parents and boyfriend about it. 

But my parents were busy buying plane tickets to accompany my adoptive sister abroad for a dance competition. 

My boyfriend was also working overtime a lot lately. My finger hovered over the message for a long time before I chose to delete it. 

I knew that anything about me, even if I said it, wouldn't matter to anyone.

After all, in everyone's eyes, my existence isn't even a fraction as important as my adoptive sister's.
