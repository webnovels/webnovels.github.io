Olivia Harper watched in disbelief as her husband Marcus threw a lavish party to celebrate his first love's daughter getting into community college. Meanwhile, their own son Ethan, the school valedictorian, was forced to work as a waiter at the very same event.

Chloe Gardner, Marcus's first love, approached Ethan with a fake smile. "Ethan, it's been a while since you've had your dad's cooking, hasn't it? Why don't you try this special fish dish he made for Rose?"

Ethan hesitated, but before he could respond, Marcus intervened. "If Chloe's offering, just eat it. Stop being so picky – you're just like your useless mother!"

Without warning, Marcus forcefully opened Ethan's mouth and shoved a piece of fish inside, making him swallow it.

Ethan collapsed, clutching his throat in agony. Marcus simply walked away, arm in arm with Chloe and Rose.

By the time Olivia wheeled herself to her son's side, Ethan's face had turned an alarming shade of purple. She frantically dialed 91
Desperate, she called Marcus, hoping he would help their son. But his voice was full of irritation: "He probably just got a fish bone stuck in his throat. Give him some vinegar and he'll be fine. Stop making such a fuss."
