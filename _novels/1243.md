It was the first time my parents, my brother, and my sister-in-law had met my fiancé, Graham Scott.

Graham was poised, courteous, and handled the grilling with practiced ease. My parents, David and Carol, and my brother, Aaron, seemed placated. Satisfied, even.

But Sienna, my sister-in-law, frowned.

She looked at me with an expression of deep disapproval and spoke in a tone heavy with misplaced wisdom.

“Willow, I’ve been around the block, and I can tell you: you’re clearly still hung up on Patrick, the man we met last week! You need to stop this.”

“This is your whole life, darling. You cannot be rushing into this marriage, using Graham as a fallback just because you’re pregnant!”

“Yes, the doctor warned you that one more termination might leave you infertile, but you cannot settle! I’d rather support you for the rest of your life than watch you compromise like this.”

I rushed to deny it, appealing to my parents and Aaron to back me up.

But they only started to waffle, their clarification vague, effectively muddying the waters instead of clearing them.

Graham looked utterly defeated. He left in a fit of anger, driving away only to die in a car accident moments later.

I went insane, demanding answers, cornering Sienna and the rest of my family.

But Sienna merely shrugged, her voice light and dismissive.

“I was only trying to help you, Willow. I was testing if he had one hundred percent faith in you.”

My family nodded along in support.

“Thank God we tested him, then! Imagine if you’d actually married that short-lived loser—you’d be crying for years!”

Rage blinding me, I grabbed them, insisting they come with me to Graham’s grave to repent.

I never made it. I was shoved down the stairs by one of them and died.

I woke up, back at the beginning.

I looked at Sienna, who was already starting to give me her knowing, conspiratorial eye-roll. I smiled.

If you’re so intent on "testing" my fiancé, Sienna, then I’ll be "testing" my brother for you.

Dinner had just wrapped up. We were settled on the plush sectional in my new living room, the conversation inevitably turning to the wedding plans with Graham.

Sienna Marshall couldn't hold it in any longer.

“Willow, this is a lifelong commitment. You can’t shortchange yourself like this.”

“Where is Patrick, the man we had lunch with just last week? The handsome one with the investment banking job and the condo in the West Village? He was so much better, and you clearly liked him more! Why are you settling for this Graham Scott?”

I paused, but I didn't feel the surge of anger I had the first time. I only felt a strange detachment.

“Sienna, what on earth are you talking about? I never—”

She cut me off before I could finish, not even looking at me, barreling forward with her speech.

“Even if you don’t want me to say it, I have to, darling. If I don’t say it now, it will be too late forever!”

“I know you’re rushing to get married because of the baby! But I stand by what I said: don’t let a big house and a fancy car from this man force you to have a child that will only be used as an illegitimate pawn in a family fortune fight!”

“I still hope you’ll reconsider, Willow. Terminate the pregnancy. Move on with your life. You’ve had so many, what’s one more?”

“If what the doctor said is true, and this one really does make you infertile, so be it. Mom, Dad, Aaron, and I—we will all take care of you for the rest of your life!”

Sienna went on and on, weaving a story about me being promiscuous and a gold-digger who was trying to trap an unsuspecting man for his money.

I remained perfectly calm.

I had lived through this exact scene before.

Last time, everything had gone smoothly until we started talking about the wedding, and then Sienna suddenly went manic. Under the "neutral" oversight of my parents and brother, I couldn't get a single word in edgewise. Graham believed me, but he couldn't stand against the united "testimony" of my whole family. He left, he crashed, and I didn't survive long after him.

I had been reborn.

I wasn’t about to fall into the same trap twice. I had been ready for Sienna's attack, and as she grew more animated, my expression grew colder.

But I didn't try to refute her. Instead, I stood up abruptly, raised my hand, and slapped Sienna across the face with every ounce of force I had.

“I don’t care if you’re drunk or possessed, I order you to snap out of it!”

The silence that followed the smack was absolute.

Sienna was stunned. My parents and Aaron were also shocked into stillness.

They couldn't pretend they hadn't seen it, nor could they keep playing dumb. They all jumped up, pulling me aside, a cacophony of outrage rising around me.

Aaron Reed shielded Sienna behind him, his finger nearly poking me in the eye. “What in God’s name is wrong with you, Willow? How could you put your hands on her?”

“She’s your sister-in-law! Don’t you remember how much she’s done for you over the years?”

“No matter what she said, it was for your own good! You don’t have to appreciate it, but you certainly don’t get to hit her!”

I let out a cold, cynical laugh.

So, when Sienna was slandering me, they were deaf, dumb, and blind. The second I defended myself, they “came alive.”

But Aaron’s attempt at moral blackmail failed. I spoke softly, my voice laced with steel. “She only deserves respect when she acts respectable.”

“Did she do good things for me? Yes. But have I been good to her? You look at what she’s wearing, what jewelry she’s flaunting. Who paid for it? I did.”

“She doesn't have to thank me, but she certainly can't spew lies in front of my fiancé. That’s for my good? For whose good?”

“If we want to talk about good, I slapped her for your good. If you don't rein in that filthy mouth of hers, she’ll bring down ruin on the entire Reed family. After all, trouble comes out of an open mouth.”

All four of them were speechless.

I hadn't even bothered to deny her claims, yet I was armed with a superior logic they weren't prepared for. This was completely off-script.

In their plan, I was supposed to be sobbing, begging Graham to believe me, then pleading with them to vouch for my purity and virtue.

But you can’t clarify something that never happened using only words. So this time, I wasn't going to waste time on a battle of wits.

Sienna, however, was nearly spitting mad from the blow.

She hid behind Aaron and yelled across the room at Graham.

“I didn’t lie!”

“Willow is right; maybe I wasn’t doing this for her good. I just can’t stand how she treats relationships! I can see you’re a good man, Graham, and I don't want you to be blindsided. I don't want you to be a cuckold!”

Graham’s expression was an odd mix of confusion and stoicism.

After a long pause, he spoke. “I trust Willow’s character. Furthermore, she has been with me for most of last week. She had no time to meet any ‘stranger’ for an engagement talk.”

He was right.

My rebirth didn’t happen at this moment; it happened ten days ago.

I had already spoken to Graham. Last time, he was 80% convinced; this time, he was 100% on my side.

I stepped forward, took Graham’s hand, and turned back to Sienna, a triumphant smirk on my face.

“Sienna, you are either lying or having a sudden mental breakdown. Since you’ve always been such a sweet sister-in-law, it must be the latter. I’ll call the clinic right now and have you admitted for a mandatory 72-hour hold for psychological observation.”

“I’m sure Mom, Dad, and Aaron won’t have any objection to that, right?”

David, Carol, and Aaron didn't dare object.

Not only was my reasoning sound, but more importantly, I was essentially their sole financial backer.

I paid their mortgage, bought their life insurance policies, paid for their car, and even the utility bills were tied to my bank account.

I wasn’t bluffing. I actually reached for my phone to make the call.

Sienna looked terrified.

Her relationship with Aaron was already strained, and if I hadn't been constantly supporting her, her life in the Reed family would have been hell. If I sent her to a locked psychiatric ward, she might never get out.

She gritted her teeth.

“I’m not lying! I have proof! You’ve all been deceived by Willow Reed.”

As she spoke, she hesitated, then pulled a folded A4 paper out of her handbag. I recognized it immediately: a sonogram image.

The results slip bore my name.

Sienna stammered, “I went with Willow for a check-up last week. It shows she’s seven weeks pregnant. Everything I said just now—that she was trying to trap an unsuspecting man—was what she told the doctor. I haven’t lied about a single thing!”

In the previous life, Graham had been driven away by their chaotic yelling before Sienna could even produce this evidence. I had no idea it existed. But I wasn't scared; I simply shook my head.

“That result? AI can generate thousands of those in a minute.”

Sienna didn’t argue. She snatched my phone, typed in my unlock code with practiced ease, and navigated to the City Medical Center's patient portal.

“This is the official patient portal for Tri-State General. I just logged in with your information. This is the electronic medical record for that check-up. The paper can be fake, but this digital record can’t be!”

This time, even I couldn't find a quick retort.

Sienna was right. A paper copy could be forged, but the official hospital electronic file could not.

Seeing my silence, my mother, Carol Reed, seemed to sigh in relief. She looked at me with a touch of guilt. “Willow, I know your sister-in-law has a cruel way of putting things, but she truly is looking out for your future. You can’t hide something like this forever.”

My father, David, nodded in agreement.

“That’s right. If you want to keep the baby, we won’t stop you. But marrying him under false pretenses is no good. You can always have the baby and let Aaron adopt him. Your reputation won’t suffer at all.”

Aaron bypassed me completely and patted Graham on the shoulder.

“Buddy, I sincerely hoped you’d become my brother-in-law. You’re a great guy, well-mannered, and you treat Willow well. But my sister really isn't good enough for you. She's not a good girl.”

“We’re the ones who failed you, Graham. We didn’t raise her right. So I have to apologize to you, on behalf of our whole family.”

Sienna looked like she’d won the lottery. She was waiting for Graham to explode, to maybe even slap me or drag me out of the room.

But Graham didn’t move.

He just looked at me with an extremely odd expression, as if to say, Why is this all happening exactly as you predicted?

Because I had specifically told him to listen and not speak, he could only close his mouth, his face a mask of confusing composure.

I didn’t answer his silent question. Instead, I let out a genuine laugh. “What a coincidence!”

“Graham’s uncle gave me a voucher for a full executive physical. Graham and I went together yesterday. Full body workup. And somehow… they missed the seven-week pregnancy.”

As I spoke, I pulled out my own detailed medical report for verification.

“This one is from a reputable health center. It also has a verified digital file. And Graham was with me when I had the blood work done. So I don't just have physical proof, I have a verifiable human witness.”

Sienna stared at me in disbelief.

I didn't give her a chance to recover. I picked up my phone again.

“But Sienna would never try to hurt me. She must have known something to get so upset. This is clearly the fault of whoever used my medical ID for insurance fraud.”

“I’m calling the police right now to report the fraud...”

Sienna slapped the phone out of my hand. “Don’t try to change the subject!”

“Maybe you had an abortion after you saw me! That's why your results are clean! As for witnesses, we are four witnesses! We can all testify that you brought a different man home last Wednesday to discuss an engagement!”

Sienna shot a hard look at the three Reeds.

They hesitated for a moment but eventually nodded.

“She’s right. It was Wednesday. I remember clearly.”

“If you want to deny it, tell us where you were that Wednesday!”

I couldn’t answer. Last Wednesday, Carol had dragged me shopping all day, and she clearly wouldn't be my witness now.

I found the situation even more ridiculous than before.

It turned out their plan wasn’t riddled with holes; they had thought of every possible angle.

But I wasn't worried.

I pointed to the large screen TV in the corner.

“Even more of a coincidence.”

“I installed a hidden security system ten days ago. Since you claim I brought a man home last Wednesday to discuss marriage, why don’t we roll the footage? Let’s see what man I brought home.”

Hearing this, Sienna’s face instantly went pale. She screamed, running toward the TV, clawing and yelling that I couldn't turn on the monitor.

“You can’t watch the monitor! If you watch the monitor, your engagement with Graham is completely ruined!”

“If you must watch it, at least send Graham away first! He’ll be heartbroken to see it!”

I almost laughed out loud.

Graham, however, looked uncomfortable for a different reason. “Sienna, you don’t need to worry about me. I trust Willow. I'm willing to watch the monitor to confirm her innocence.”

I chimed in, “Sienna, this is my house, and Graham is my fiancé. I’m not scared. Why are you so scared?”

I held back the frantic Sienna and nodded to Graham to proceed.

Graham had helped me install the system, so he was perfectly comfortable projecting the feed onto the TV. In seconds, the security camera facing the front door showed a strange man entering the house, moving with the familiarity of a homeowner, and heading straight for the guest bedroom.

The Reeds gasped in surprise.

Sienna quickly seized the moment. “See? There’s the man! Turn it off! There will definitely be some R-rated scenes!”

But Graham didn’t turn it off. He simply hit the pause button.

Sienna breathed a sigh of relief. Aaron looked at me with a furious, disappointed stare.

“Willow Reed, the evidence is undeniable. What do you have to say for yourself? You hit your sister-in-law just for speaking the truth! You owe her an apology immediately!”

Just as he finished speaking, Graham fast-forwarded a few minutes, as I had instructed.

A second figure appeared in the surveillance footage. And that person was none other than Sienna Marshall.
