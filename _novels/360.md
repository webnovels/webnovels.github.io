Julian Thorne's ex, Seraphina, was back from overseas, divorced, and pregnant.

The moment she returned, my husband of five years, Julian, just told me to take care of her every need.

I didn’t argue or make a fuss; I simply accepted. After all, everyone in the family knew I was just a stand-in for Seraphina.

All these years, he'd ignored my dedication to this family.

One casual comment from his ex about wanting a 'servant' and I'd be running myself ragged for her. If she so much as sighed, Julian would practically hand her his soul.

When Seraphina saw me, she immediately flung herself into Julian's arms.

"Brother Julian always had good taste, marrying a free housekeeper."

"I just wonder if asking Amelia to take care of me will make her angry…"

Angry? There was no need. Julian had already signed the divorce papers three days ago.

From now on, we were going our separate ways, no strings attached.
