Eight months pregnant, I was forced to kneel on the cold marble floor in the snowy night, all because my husband's childhood sweetheart falsely accused me of killing his mother.
Alexander Foster, my husband, was in the glass greenhouse warming the frozen feet of his sweetheart, his expression full of doting affection.
I caught a chill and my water broke. I was rushed to the emergency room, but Alexander accused me of acting weak.
I suffered severe bleeding and faced a life-threatening situation, yet Alexander callously signed a life-or-death agreement:
"As long as the child can be saved, there's no need to rescue Olivia if she dies."
However, I gave birth to a stillborn child and fell into postpartum depression, while my husband was accompanying his sweetheart for prenatal checkups.
To please his sweetheart, on my birthday, Alexander even forced me to eat the placenta raw.
"You killed my mother. This is the retribution you deserve."
It turned out that the love and marriage I had been guarding was nothing but my own wishful thinking.
Filled with endless anger and humiliation, I decided to seek revenge.
