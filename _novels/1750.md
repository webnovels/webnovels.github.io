I cut my wrist to feed Dominic Keller my blood, keeping him alive while we were trapped in the blizzard. My own sacrifice cost me the feeling in my legs, frostbite stealing my mobility and leaving me a vegetable for five years.
The exact moment my consciousness flickered back to life, the first sound I heard was his voice—a clear, even cadence—speaking to a doctor.
“Mr. Keller, your wife is stable and shows promising signs of awakening. Are you absolutely certain about proceeding with euthanasia?”
Dominic’s voice was too calm, too rational. “Money is no object, but I’ve invested five years of my life into this. I’m tapped out. She’s not living like this. It’s better to just let her go.”
A searing, dizzying acidity flooded my heart.
Five years had changed everything. The man who had once wept, begging me not to die, had finally been taken by the relentless, erosive march of time.
...

The sound of footsteps stopped beside the bed, and I lifted my head to see Dominic for the first time in five years.
He wasn't as frantic or elated as I had imagined. His gaze held a strange, complicated opacity. He opened his mouth, but the only thing that came out was a quiet, almost perfunctory question.
“Is there anything you need? Anywhere you feel pain? I’ll call the doctor.”
My throat was desert dry, but no sound would come out. I could only offer a slow, almost imperceptible shake of my head.
The atmosphere in the sterile room was suffocatingly quiet.
It shattered when the door flew open and a bright, quick voice chirped, “Dom, you promised we’d head out to get my birthday sapphire!”
The young woman who burst in froze immediately, our eyes locking. Her smile—so wide, so radiant—collapsed entirely. Hesitantly, she looked toward Dominic.
Dominic shifted, an awkward flush creeping up his neck. He avoided her gaze and offered a quick, strained explanation to me.
“Jen, this is my assistant, Skylar Reed.”
Skylar obviously resented the clinical title, but she merely blinked, her eyes clouding with tears, and said nothing.
I lowered my gaze, a dull ache throbbing in my chest. The girl, Skylar, was the ghost of my twenty-five-year-old self. Young, vibrant, with that distinctive smile that crinkled her nose and exposed the youthful prominence of her canine teeth. It was the look Dominic had always claimed to love the most.
He seemed desperate to escape the tense bubble we were in. He took Skylar’s elbow and ushered her out. Moments later, the medical team swept in for my full physical assessment.
The diagnosis was a formal confirmation of what I already knew: I was awake, but the damage to my legs was permanent. I would likely never stand unaided again. It wasn't a shock. I hadn't expected to live through the blizzard in the first place.
For the next few days, Dominic came with clockwork regularity. He was skilled and meticulous: he massaged my withered legs, he peeled fruit for me with practiced ease. But he was quiet. When I tried to engage him, he would only listen patiently, offering no real response, no argument, just silence. He operated on a strict schedule, leaving precisely the moment the sun began to dip below the horizon.
Every time I reached out to stop him, he would offer the same dismissive excuse.
“I have work to handle, Jen. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
The hospital door closed yet again.
I stared blankly at the fading afternoon light, and the muffled chatter of the nurses in the hall drifted in, every cruel word audible.
“Did you hear? The vegetable who’s been comatose for five years finally woke up.”
“Can you believe it? And her husband was about to pull the plug, right?”
My fingers, resting on the blanket, curled into a fist. I hadn’t had the chance to understand the last five years of Dominic’s life. He had stonewalled every question.
“You don’t know the half of it. Her husband is loaded. He’s poured tens of millions into experimental treatments and imported meds just to keep her going.” The envy in the voice was palpable, before the tone soured. “But he has a new girl now. That’s why he wanted to sign the DNR.”
The moment they mentioned the “new girl,” Skylar’s bright, hurt face flashed in my mind. The knowledge wasn't new, but the blunt cruelty of it was. How could twenty years—a lifetime—with Dominic be dismissed so easily?
It was the day I was discharged. As Dominic helped me into the car, I looked up at his chiseled profile and asked a question I knew was pointless.
“Could you let your assistant go?”
His hand, which was bracing my elbow, paused. He didn't answer, instead deflecting as he always did.
“The weather’s beautiful today. I thought we could stop by the waterfront for a bit of sun before heading home?”
I tightened my grip on his wrist, holding him in place. “Dominic. What are you afraid of? You told me she was just your assistant.”
The smile he’d been forcing evaporated completely. He pulled his wrist back sharply, creating a distance between us that was wider than the car seat. He took a deep, ragged breath.
“Jenny, I didn’t beg you to save me five years ago.” The words were a gunshot. “I’ve done my duty, Jen. More than. I’ve wasted money, I’ve wasted my youth. If I had known… if I had known it would turn out like this, we should have just died together on that mountain!”
My breath hitched. He saw the blank devastation in my eyes and suddenly deflated.
“No, Skylar is not my assistant. We’ve been together for three years.” Dominic’s voice was hard and hollow. “It’s her birthday today. I need to be with her.”
He threw the last words out and all but fled, a clear, wide distance between us, his escape executed with the panic of a trapped animal.
I sat in the back of the car, silent and numb, watching the city blur outside the window. His words were a relentless loop in my mind.
The driver dropped me off at the house. I pushed myself on the wheelchair toward the entrance.
Five years had blurred my memory, but the emptiness of the house was immediate. It was not warm. It looked abandoned. Dust covered the furniture like a thin shroud. In the yard, the swing set Dominic had built for me was just two rotten posts holding up a splintered plank.
It was all gone.
The framed wedding photos had been taken down from the wall. I wheeled through the cavernous, empty living room. My bedroom only contained a bed draped in a protective plastic sheet.
Seeing the evidence of his total abandonment, I closed my eyes and sighed. The haze behind my eyelids gathered into tears.
We had been together for two decades. We met young, married young, and had spent years grinding it out in a cramped Lower East Side walk-up, working tirelessly until we finally made it in Manhattan. We used our first real money to buy this house—this impossible, beautiful place right on Long Island Sound, where Dominic said he could open the window and see the ocean every morning.
I thought we had everything.
For our honeymoon, I asked to see the sunrise from the peak of a remote mountain. He took me to the Wyoming backcountry. The weather turned on us, and we were caught in an unprecedented blizzard as we descended, scrambling into a shallow, desperate cave.
He stripped the coat off his own back and wrapped me in it, trying to transfer what little warmth he had. We were trapped for seven days, without food or water. The relentless snow felt like a suffocating weight.
“Jen, I’m sorry. I couldn’t protect you.” Dominic had clung to the guilt.
But I never blamed him.
To keep him from slipping away, I used my knife to slit my palm, guiding the thick, vital blood to his lips. My legs were already dead, numb. Every time I felt myself drifting, Dominic would pinch my wrist, shouting.
“Jenny, you have to hold on! We promised forever. If you die, I won’t live either.”
When the search and rescue team finally reached us, I was gone. As I lost consciousness, Dominic was sobbing like a child. He was pleading with me not to leave him.
“Whatever it takes, I’ll make sure you live. Even if it costs me my life.”
“Don’t go too far ahead. Wait for me.”
“When you wake up, I’ll still be your husband.”
I wiped a slow tear from the corner of my eye, opening and closing my hand. When I had grabbed his wrist to stop him from leaving the hospital, I had felt the subtle, instantaneous tension of his withdrawal. I knew about his cleanliness obsession, but he had never once flinched from touching me before.
Dominic had forgotten his promises.
But he was right. He had done his duty for five years. I pulled out my phone and checked my accounts. The money I had set aside from before the coma was untouched. It would be enough to leave.
I would give them their future.
Dominic returned only after dark. He was carrying several large shopping bags filled with groceries and household essentials. When he saw me still in the desolate living room, he set the bags on the counter and knelt awkwardly in front of my wheelchair. His voice was softer, less strained.
“Jen, don’t take what I said earlier to heart. I was just…”
“I was just exhausted. For five years, I watched you lie there, motionless, and I felt so powerless. I often wondered why I was allowed to live.”
He was explaining, carefully, cautiously. “After the accident, I couldn’t bear to be here. I haven’t lived here since. But don’t worry, I’ve hired a team of private aides. They’ll take care of everything now.”
If I had heard this even a week ago, I might have been moved. But I knew the truth now: he had found someone better, someone easier.
He stood up and glanced at the flight information glowing on my phone screen. He offered a light, almost forced smile.
“Once your legs get a little stronger, we can travel. Anywhere you want. I’ll go with you.”
I pursed my lips and simply nodded.
Dominic glanced at his watch. “I have to go now.”
“Skylar has a temper. If she thinks I’m here… hands-on… she’ll get upset.” His tone was hesitant, laced with a testing uncertainty, as if he expected me to throw a scene.
I let out a silent sigh. “I know. I’ll take care of myself.”
A flash of genuine surprise crossed his face. I shifted my gaze, unable to bear the sight of his shock at my sudden compliance.
Before he could say anything else, his phone rang sharply. Skylar's complaining voice was audible even before he answered. He spoke to her patiently, his tone gentle, utterly lacking the frustration he showed me.
I sat in the wheelchair, watching my husband console his mistress. In this house, the house we built, I felt like the intruder, the inconvenience.
I looked at Dominic, almost avariciously, searching for a glimmer of the man who had loved me. There was none.
As he visibly prepared to bolt, I asked the question again, my voice flat.
“When will we file for divorce? When will you give your little girlfriend her official title?”
His forced smile snapped. He frowned. “Don’t start with this, Jen. I have to go. I’ll call you.”
The door slammed shut again, the sound echoing through the empty house.
As promised, Dominic had arranged my life perfectly. The private aides were fastidious, helping me transition from bed to chair, assisting with bathing to prevent falls. He was the only thing missing.
When I eventually asked for his new contact information, he was immediately defensive, irritable.
“Jenny, I have a career. I can’t be glued to you twenty-four-seven.”
“You have the aides. Ask them.”
“I’m not giving you my new cell number. You’ll probably spend the whole month’s retainer just on talking to me.”
After hearing variations of this a hundred times, I learned my lesson. For a full month, I never once contacted him.
I thought this was how my life would be—a quiet, supported end. Then, Dominic suddenly remembered me.
He brought Skylar to the house.
Skylar was dressed impeccably, a new, glittering ring on her finger that perfectly matched the one on Dominic’s. They were standing before me, fingers interlaced.
Skylar smiled brightly as she greeted me. “Jen, my friend is a rehabilitation specialist. He’s seen loads of cases like yours. With intense physical therapy, there’s a real chance you could walk again.”
Dominic looked at me, his mouth curved in an approving smile. “Skylar’s friend is notoriously hard to book, Jen. You should really thank her.”
Watching their nauseating, performative intimacy, a bitter taste filled my mouth. Doctors had given up; this “friend” was clearly an invention.
Before I could decline, Skylar stepped forward and pressed down on my immobile legs. She leaned close, dropping her voice to a vicious, barely audible whisper.
“Jenny Walsh, you’re dead weight. Do you really not know how to leave gracefully?”
“Dom was listening to me. He was going to put you to sleep. Why not just go back to sleep and die in peace? It’s less suffering.”
Her fingertips dug hard into my damaged thigh. The shock of the sharp, targeted pain was so jarring that I reflexively pushed her away.
To Dominic, however, it looked like I had intentionally attacked her. His face darkened instantly. He caught Skylar, helped her up, and, without asking what happened, began to lecture me.
“Jenny, a little gratitude is required! I know you’re frustrated, but Skylar is only trying to help.”
He took a sharp breath, his tone turning to pure, withering sarcasm. “They say disability changes people, makes them bitter. I never believed it, but you’re proving them right. You genuinely disappoint me.”
After his explosive outburst, Dominic fired the aides. He glanced back at me before he left.
“Since you think you’re so capable, you can manage for yourself now.”
“Don’t come crawling to Skylar for help.”
Without assistance, I couldn’t do anything. Getting into the wheelchair meant struggling and pulling myself up. Showering was terrifying, always a hair's breadth from a fall.
Three days later, I slipped in the bathroom, fell, and broke my arm.
Dominic only rushed to the hospital when the surgeon required a spouse to sign the consent form. He saw my ashen face. Something in the sight of my injury must have triggered a wave of guilt, and he started to apologize, his words tripping over themselves.
“I was just so angry last time. I’m sorry, honey. So sorry.”
“It’s fine.” I cut him off, stopping his weak justifications dead in his throat.
Dominic looked confused, perhaps expecting the usual fight, the hysterical scene, the demand for explanations. He assumed my silence meant I would eventually fight, that I would always demand the terms of our marriage.
“You’ve thought it through?” he asked, wary.
I nodded, the words coming out calmly, naturally. “You’ve done enough for me over the years. You’re right. I can’t hold your freedom hostage just because I saved your life.”
I had finally seen the full picture. Twenty years of love had been obliterated by five years of my absence.
But Dominic didn’t look relieved. His face cycled through shock and fear. He mumbled, “Jenny, please. Don’t do this.”
For the next few days in the hospital, Dominic stayed, a constant shadow. He took over the role of a personal aide, meticulous and attentive. He even tried to chat, weaving stories about a future we could have.
“When you’re stronger, we’ll go to Finland to see the Northern Lights.”
“And Iceland. The hot springs are incredible.”
I looked calmly at his profile. I had already seen those places. I had seen them on his social media feeds—with Skylar. The landscape photos, the shared meals, the staged selfies in front of their new house by the other coastline.
Suddenly, I was just tired of the charade.
As he sunk deeper into his fabricated future, I cut him short.
“Christmas is almost here. Can you meet me at Rockefeller Plaza that day? I have something to tell you.”
Dominic agreed immediately.
On Christmas Day, I arrived at Rockefeller Plaza at the agreed-upon time. After twenty years together, it was time for a clean, definitive farewell. The plaza was packed, but I saw him instantly.
And I saw Skylar standing right beside him.
“You promised you would divorce her. We’ve been waiting for three years.” Skylar was having a full meltdown, clinging to his arm.
“Jenny is dead weight now. How much longer are you going to let her cling to you?”
She grabbed his hand. “Divorce her, Dom. And make her our witness. I’ve already set the wedding date: January fifteenth.”
January fifteenth. The exact date, five years ago, that we were trapped in the blizzard.
Dominic didn't agree, but he didn't push her away, either. He hesitated.
That was all I needed.
The stone in my heart finally dropped with a quiet, relieving thud. I looked down at my phone—the boarding pass was already open. I pushed the wheelchair forward, away from them, and did not look back.
