With a sharp screech of brakes, my entire body was thrown into the air.

The moment my body hit the ground, I seemed to hear my bones shattering.

The pain blinded me.

Every bone ached excruciatingly.

"If anything happens to Ruby, you're dead!"

"Lock her in the room, don't let anyone release her!"

Throwing down these words, Lucas sped past me with the moaning Ruby.

I didn't even have the strength to struggle, helplessly allowing the bodyguards to lock me in the room.

The pain made me break out in a cold sweat. I don't know how long I lay on the ground.

The will to survive told me I had to save myself.

I gritted my teeth and slowly crawled up from the ground, staggering to find the first aid kit. I cleaned my wounds myself and took several painkillers.

Just then, a knock sounded at the door.

"Mrs. Reed, Mr. Reed instructed us to take you to the hospital to apologize to Ms. Sanders."

"Mrs. Reed?"

"Mrs. Reed!"

When they received no response from me, the bodyguards began forcefully twisting the doorknob.

But I had already locked the door from the inside.

Expressionlessly, I took out a lighter and began setting fire to this bedroom I had once lovingly decorated.

The flames devoured the past, as if burning away a ridiculous dream.

As the raging fire engulfed me, I closed my eyes and allowed the flames to consume me.

Billowing black smoke seeped out from under the door.

The door was suddenly pounded with thunderous force, but showed no signs of giving way.

Amidst the chaotic footsteps and screams, I tightly hugged my parents' ashes and jumped out the window, limping away from the villa.

Until that mansion was far behind me, the explosive "BOOM" still pierced the quiet night sky.

The shackles that had confined me for six years finally fell away at this moment.

Just as Lucas and I's lives would never intersect again.

Check-in, ticketing, baggage drop, security...

Before boarding, I took out my SIM card, snapped it in half, and casually tossed it in the trash.

Then I headed towards a brand new future without looking back.
