When I woke up again, it was three days later.

Lucas sat by the bed, his face expressionless as he brought over a bowl of porridge, making to feed me.

I discreetly avoided him, my voice hoarse.

"When will you give me the divorce papers?"

He barely lifted his eyelids, his voice low. "Open your mouth."

"I'm willing to leave with nothing. The divorce papers, you..."

"Ugh—"

The moment he forcefully shoved the porridge down my throat, I instinctively bent over, violently retching.

A lot of it splashed onto his legs.

He seemed oblivious, his face ashen as he smashed the bowl on the ground, forcefully gripping my neck, his tone icy cold.

"Aria Shaw, don't play the divorce card with me. You're destined to be trapped in the Reed family for life, struggling and atoning forever!"

"If you have the guts, just die! Otherwise, you'll never get rid of me."

He paused, his gaze falling on my flat abdomen, his eyes devoid of any warmth.

"You should be grateful that this bastard was stillborn. Otherwise, I wouldn't have let it live either. Carrying the Shaw family's bloodline only disgusts me!"

I was choking, struggling to breathe, but I masochistically dug my nails into my palms, looking at him, slowly breaking into laughter. The laughter grew louder and louder, yet tears streamed down my face.

So, so my six years had been this pathetic and laughable.

I closed my eyes in despair, my voice trembling: "Lucas Reed, just strangle me to death."

Lucas stared at me intently, his eyes bloodshot, his grip tightening.

Until a jarring phone ringtone suddenly broke the silence of the room.

His whole body shuddered. He glanced at the caller ID and roughly pushed me away, leaving without looking back.

I sprawled on the bed pathetically, clutching my neck and coughing violently like a drowning person, tears smearing my entire face.

The next moment, Ruby sent a picture.

It was a pregnancy test.

It clearly showed: 4 weeks gestation, threatened miscarriage.

Another message quickly followed.

"On your sixth anniversary, we tried all sorts of new positions under the starry sky where you two first fell in love. This child was conceived that night."

"Aria Shaw, if you know what's good for you, you'll leave the Reed family on your own."

My hand holding the phone turned white at the knuckles.

On our sixth anniversary, Lucas had disappeared until dawn before coming home.

He smelled of Ruby's perfume. I was already asleep and was roughly awakened by him.

He ignored my pleas and cries, seeming to have lost all reason as he ravaged me all night.

Until I started bleeding and was rushed to the hospital to save the pregnancy.

And that day, Lucas had actually come to me straight from her bed.

My stomach churned violently.

I could no longer control myself. Ignoring my torn wounds, I rushed to the bathroom and vomited until I saw stars.

I collapsed on the floor, hugging myself, breaking down in heart-wrenching sobs.

Later, I lay alone in the hospital for half a month. I never saw Lucas again until the day I was discharged.

Three hours before my flight to Germany, I still went back to the old mansion for my parents' ashes.

As I was driving away, suddenly, out of nowhere, Ruby rushed in front of my car.

My pupils constricted as I slammed on the brakes.

The tires let out a sharp screech, barely stopping an inch from her knees. Yet Ruby collapsed to the ground, covered in blood.

"Ruby!"

Lucas, who was behind me, saw this and his face changed. He quickly ran over to embrace the bloodied Ruby.

Ruby clutched his hand tightly, blood continuously spurting from her mouth.

"Lucas, don't blame Mrs. Shaw. She definitely didn't mean to."

I stumbled out of the car, instinctively looking towards Lucas, urgently saying: "It wasn't me, she ran in front of..."

But before I could finish, Lucas suddenly looked up, his eyes bloodshot as he stared at me, his neck flushed red with bulging veins.

The bone-deep hatred in his eyes rendered me speechless.

"Aria, wasn't killing my parents enough? Do you have to harm everyone around me?! What the hell did I do to deserve this from you?! Do you have to destroy my entire family?!"

By the end, his eyes were crimson, glaring at me viciously.

"Aria Shaw, you really deserve to die!"

A chill inexplicably rose in my heart.

The next second, he carried Ruby to the car, then sat in the driver's seat himself.

As the engine roared to life, Lucas's eyes grew increasingly red.

The next moment, he floored the accelerator, driving straight towards me.
