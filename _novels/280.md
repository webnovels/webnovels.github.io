Six years into our marriage, my husband, Liam, suddenly updated his Ins story:

"Whose adorable little noob is this, totally obsessed with gaming?"

The picture showed a girl in a tight-fitting bunny T-shirt, pouting and cross-legged on a gaming chair. It was Ashley, the new idol from his company.

I was staring, lost in thought, when a comment popped up from a mutual friend below:

"Dude! You forgot to switch accounts!"

Seconds later, Liam’s post vanished without a trace, only to reappear on Ashley’s Ins page shortly after.

Liam called me almost immediately.

Back in the day, I would have screenshot that post, saved it, and blown up at Liam, ready to raise hell until the world turned upside down.

But this time, I just quietly watched the screen, waiting for the call to automatically hang up.
