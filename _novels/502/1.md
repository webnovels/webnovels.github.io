Lily and I were both transported to this world.

Her identity here was the substitute for Callum's idealized love - the holy priestess Sophia.

In this savage tribe of shapeshifters, the priest held an exalted position blessed with divine power.

Callum was handsome and revered by everyone in the tribe.

Unfortunately, his heart was always fixated on the priestess Sophia.

No matter how beautiful, a cold butt that can't be warmed is useless.

As expected of best friends, my situation was even worse than hers.

When we first arrived, not understanding the situation, a row of naked men knelt before us begging to be chosen.

I just had to pick the most dangerous-looking one.

With a low, icy voice and a dangerous aura. Everyone in the tribe feared the Snake King's venom, and even more so his ruthless cruelty.

It wasn't until the man was in bed that I realized how powerful those two appendages of his were.

To protect myself, I became the Snake King Liam's devoted pet.

As long as he was happy, I suffered a little less.

In our previous life, Lily and I relied on our modern knowledge to greatly improve the tribe.

We built bridges and roads, constructed houses and wove cloth, and even dug a simple well.

But while our men were away, Sophia needed only one word to turn us into sacrificial offerings on the altar.

The two of us were tied to pillars, watching helplessly as Sophia, wearing a pristine white robe and an angelic smile, raised a dagger to my face.

Slice by slice, slice by slice.

My blood stained the altar red. I was beheaded, my body torn to pieces.

With a final burst of flame, Sophia burned our very souls.

"What did she actually talk to you about?"

"How would I know? I never went to meet her."

Lily gritted her teeth.

"Living a second time, I'm not that stupid."

I sighed, rubbing my forehead.

"Callum may be cold, but even if Sophia causes trouble, he'll just be distant for a few days. At worst, he might send you away."

I laughed coldly, though my heart was pounding:

"But that snake of mine..."

Lily shuddered along with me:

"Your psycho snake is truly terrifying. He might really flay you alive."

"It's not just 'might'."

I trembled, recalling the rumors about the Snake King:

Apparently, to extract information, Liam once cut off a prisoner's ears and then skinned the shapeshifter alive.

The screams echoed endlessly, scaring the enemy into fleeing in all directions. It became a legend that established his reputation.

Unfortunately, such a "god of death" had never stayed for me.

His heart and eyes were also fixed on the woman who had doomed Lily and me

— Sophia.

Thinking about having to die, I also needed to plan my escape luggage.

As soon as I entered the door, I was grabbed by the waist and pinned against the wall in a dizzying motion.

A voice that made my heart race sounded:

"Where have you been?"
