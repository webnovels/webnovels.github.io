Upon learning of her first love's death, my wife, with whom I was on our honeymoon, leaped from the cruise ship, ending her life.

It was then that I realized she had never truly let go of Lucas Graham.

Reborn into our youth, she decisively let go of my hand and strode towards her first love.

I watched them leave, then turned away.

From that moment on, our lives became two parallel lines, never to intersect.

Ten years later, we met again at a gala in Bay City.

She had become a new socialite, affectionately clinging to Lucas Graham's arm as they made their entrance.

Seeing me crash the gala looking for someone, she couldn't help but advise me.

"Why do you have to be so obsessed with me? Even if you waited for me for ten years, I still wouldn't fall in love with you."

I ignored her and pulled my son out from the corner where he was sneaking cake.

Her eyes suddenly reddened, and she gripped my hand tightly.

"Are you trying to make me jealous on purpose? Didn't you say you'd only love me in this lifetime?"
