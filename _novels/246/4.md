　　When I woke up on the sofa, their family of three had already left.

　　In their eyes, I had become invisible.

　　My phone buzzed. It was my special notification for Chloe; I knew the moment she posted anything.

　　Her SnapChat story showed wedding photos of Evelyn and Marcus.

　　For fifteen years, wedding photos had been a thorn in my side. We'd been in a hurry back then and never got around to taking any.

　　Every year after that, when I brought it up, Evelyn refused, saying we were too old for such "young people's antics."

　　But now, she was leaning into Marcus's embrace like a young girl, a picture of pure bliss.

　　It wasn't that she didn't want to take them; she just didn't want to take them with me.

　　When I swiped to the second photo, I froze in shock. It was Marcus and Evelyn's marriage certificate.

　　Two bright red documents stung my eyes. The marriage date was two years ago.

　　Chloe had commented: "So fortunate to witness my parents' love."

　　For fifteen years, every anniversary, I had suggested we get a marriage certificate, but Evelyn had always gracefully declined.

　　Turns out, she and Marcus had already remarried, keeping me completely in the dark.

　　I had been a complete fool, a free laborer for the mother and daughter.

　　Now that Marcus was back, they planned to kick me out.

　　My rage exploded at that moment. The indignation in my heart couldn't be quelled. I had to go demand an explanation.

　　I arrived at the bridal shop. Evelyn and Chloe were still inside, changing clothes.

　　Marcus sat in his car, a cigarette dangling from his lips. The moment he saw me, a flicker of malice appeared in his eyes.

　　He pressed the gas and charged toward me. Just as the car was about to hit me, in the nick of time, he slammed on the brakes.

　　He stuck his head out and sneered:

　　"Consider this a warning. I'm back. If you're smart, you'll leave them and vanish from their lives immediately."

　　"Otherwise, I can't guarantee I'll be able to stop the car next time."

　　"And if you dare show up at Chloe's wedding, I'll make sure you regret it."

　　With that, Marcus sped off, leaving a cloud of exhaust in his wake.

　　I was drenched in cold sweat, collapsing to the ground.

　　The moment I thought I was going to be hit, my blood pressure shot up, and my head swam.

Now, I felt the relief of a narrow escape. I lay on the ground, gasping for breath. 

That was the closest I'd come to death. I quickly pulled out my emergency heart medication and swallowed it.

　　Marcus's threats replayed in my mind, making my heart pound, refusing to calm down.

　　After that near-death experience, I had completely lost all last hope for that mother and daughter.

　　Back home, I pulled out the suitcase I’d already packed from under the bed and left that very night.

　　As the car drove towards the mansion, I finally pulled up to a large estate and knocked on the door.

　　The moment the door opened, a surprised cry rang out: "Dad, what are you doing here?"

　　"It's a long story, son."

　　Daniel took my suitcase and brought it inside, warmly inviting me into his home.

　　Seeing me looking weary from travel, he naturally knew I'd been wronged and gently comforted me:
