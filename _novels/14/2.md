After venting their frustrations without holding back, the neighbors suddenly remembered that Samuel's mother was standing right in front of them.

Tears streamed down Ella's face, her eyes clouded with sorrow. Her lips trembled for a long moment before she barely managed to speak, "Did that ungrateful man really say that?

"Mia, in this life, I owe you an apology. I've ruined your life. I'm useless, but I'll use this life to make it up to you."

She was so overwhelmed by the shock that she was on the verge of breaking down.

Under the heavy silence of the onlookers, I gritted my teeth and said, "Ella, this isn't your fault. It's Samuel. He's lost his way. I've never blamed you!

"If it weren't for you feeding me when I was little, I'd have starved to death long ago. I don't want you to apologize. I want you to live a good life!"

When I was very young, my parents died in a flood.

I was alone. It was Ella who adopted me, giving me food and raising me until I grew up safely.

Years ago, Samuel was in a relationship with Sarah. But Sarah, dissatisfied with Samuel being just a bomb disposal soldier with no future, left him a letter and ran off with a wealthy man from the town.

Since then, Samuel was deeply hurt and turned to me for comfort.

Ella had always liked me for being hardworking and capable, urging me to agree to marry him. I married Samuel with gratitude in my heart, but then Sarah returned.

Samuel wanted a divorce, but Ella firmly opposed it. The whole town was talking about it.

With Sarah's instigation, Samuel believed it was me who was causing trouble, and he hated me for it. To get back at me, he and Sarah would go to town every day, eating and drinking without care, wasting money recklessly.

My emotions were in turmoil, but I forced myself to comfort Ella.

Seeing she finally calmed down, I reached out and took her rough, weathered hand.

"Ella, your health isn't good. You won't last much longer.

"Let me switch places with you, okay?"

As soon as those words left my mouth, the crowd that had come to help erupted in protest.

"Mia, think this through. This is a landmine left from the battlefield. If something goes wrong, even if you survive, you'll be left crippled. Your whole future will be ruined!"

"You're so young, and you can read. Don't risk your future like this!"

Ella's tears wouldn't stop.

"Mia, I raised you, but it's only because your parents saved me from the flood all those years ago!

"I'm old, and if I die, so be it. Don't make things worse!"

I held onto her hand, refusing to let go.

"I can't just watch you die. If you won't switch, I'm not going anywhere. We'll both be blown to pieces together!"

After my pleading and threats, Ella finally agreed to switch places.

The community police, seeing they couldn't convince me, moved back with the crowd for safety's sake.

Back when Samuel and I were close, he'd once told me about how a teammate in his unit had to replace someone who stepped on a landmine. I carefully taught Ella the steps, moving my foot gingerly.

It wasn't easy. My legs felt like they were going to give out.

But now, I was beyond caring. The only person who had ever been kind to me was Ella, and I couldn't bear to watch her get hurt.

After a long, painful silence, Ella and I successfully swapped places.

She wiped her tears and looked at me, stamping her foot in frustration.

"Mia, wait here. I will personally go and get that bastard back!"

Seeing that I had actually swapped with Ella, the neighbors' eyes were filled with admiration.

The neighbors who had just caught their breath now spoke up again.

"We'll take you there. You need to teach Samuel a lesson. He's gone way too far!"

The group quickly helped Ella down the road, disappearing from sight.

I stood in silence with the community police, waiting for what felt like an eternity before they finally came back.
