The explosion that everyone expected did not happen.

The scene was eerily quiet.

I didn't know how long it took, but I finally mustered enough strength to open my eyes. That was when I realized that a man was holding onto my legs with all his might.

My body felt numb. My upper body was leaning forward, and my legs were firmly pressed down by him, yet I was still standing there as if nothing had happened.

A few military officers reacted first, hastily helping the man up.

"Mr. Foster, have you gone mad? This is a real war zone, a deadly minefield!"

"How could you be so reckless? If it had exploded, what would you have done?"

The man, Luke Foster, was cursed out thoroughly, but he didn't care.

"Then what do you suggest I do? This is an innocent life, how could I just stand by and watch her die right in front of me?"

As he spoke, everyone's gaze turned toward Samuel.

Samuel was unnerved by their stares and looked helpless.

"Are you all idiots? How can you all be so manipulated by this woman?

"I've been here before. I've cleaned this place. There are no landmines here!

"Mia, stop acting, apologize, and explain to everyone now!"

He said through gritted teeth, and Sarah, standing beside him, looked utterly innocent.

"Mia, doesn't everyone in the village know you're jealous of me? You're just making up excuses to get Samuel to come back!

"Now that you've gotten what you wanted, can't you just admit it?"

I nearly died, and I was still in a daze.

Seeing that I refused to speak, Sarah began to cry.

"Mia, it's my fault, is that enough to make you happy?

"I shouldn't have gone to town with Samuel, I shouldn't have made you jealous. I'll leave, is that okay with you?"

With that, Sarah turned to walk away. Samuel clenched his fists tightly and pulled her back.

"Sarah, you didn't do anything wrong, it's all this woman's fault.

"Mia, I married you because my mom forced me to. How long are you going to keep holding onto the title of my wife?"

As he spoke, he reached out to grab me, but his hand never made contact. Instead, Luke seized his wrist.

"Mr. Foster, you've been deceived by this scheming woman!

"This woman is a master of manipulation. I'll file for a divorce immediately. This doesn't concern you, so just leave."

Luke's face was cold as he gritted his teeth.

"Samuel! Even if she's not your wife, even if there's only a one-in-a-million chance, even if this landmine is a dud, human life is at stake. You have to save her first!

"Have you forgotten the values you were taught in the military?"

He then shifted his gaze to Sarah.

Sarah, frightened by the coldness in Luke's eyes, took a step back and weakly collapsed into Samuel's arms.

"Samuel, I see it now.

"No wonder so many people are willing to act with Mia. It's all because of him."

Although Sarah didn't make it explicit, everyone present understood her insinuation.

A few young neighbors couldn't hold their temper any longer and immediately spoke up for me.

"Sarah, I think you've lost your mind. Every time you open your mouth, you spread lies."

"Mr. Foster is someone we met on our way here. This is our first time meeting him today. There's no relationship!"

"Stop dirtying everything with your own filth. If you're trash, don't think everyone else is too!"

This statement didn't spare Sarah any dignity, and she burst into tears right there.
