At the centennial banquet of Perry Corporation, I accidentally wore a bracelet belonging to Declan Perry's ex-wife.

Seven-year-old Asher Perry pushed me down the stairs in front of everyone and splashed champagne all over me. He stood above me on the steps, his gaze cold and disdainful, just like his father's.

"Who do you think you are, wearing my mom's bracelet?"

"Don't think you can replace her by trying to win me over! When I grow up, I'll make sure you get kicked out of the Perry Family!"

The evening breeze blew softly, extinguishing the last warmth in my heart. Looking at this child I had raised since birth, I suddenly understood.

Awkwardly, I got up, meeting his gaze with calmness. "You don't have to wait until you grow up. I'll leave tomorrow."
