The chat history showed that the contact, noted as "Samantha - XX University," had been chatting with Asher for nearly two months. Above the latest message, Asher's avatar showed a reply:

[Been single too long, finally met someone who understands me.]

Scrolling further revealed more explicit conversations:

[You said during streaming you like girls with long hair, so I grew mine out [Photo]]

[So obedient? Next time we meet, I’ll have to check the length [Kiss emoji]]

Daphne felt the world spinning. With trembling fingers, she scrolled up, seeing that last Wednesday—when Asher claimed he was attending a "Platform business meeting"—he had sent this girl a hotel location.

"Found my phone?" Asher walked in, still flushed from the alcohol. When he saw the phone in Daphne's hand, his expression froze.

"Yeah, someone just messaged…" Daphne handed over the phone, her voice eerily calm, "What was today's stream about? It seemed popular."

Asher glanced at the phone, showing no emotion, then naturally locked the screen and pocketed it. "The usual, talked about life, sang some songs.

Just script stuff, don't overthink it." He kissed her forehead, the gesture now seeming so deliberate.

"I'll go see them off; you should rest early."

Daphne stood still, watching her husband's departing figure. She realized she hadn't watched Asher's streams as a viewer for a long time. She was always busy with backend work, and Asher never actively encouraged her to watch his content.

Back in the bedroom, Daphne opened her tablet and searched for Asher's stream replay. The latest episode was titled "A Thirty-Year-Old Single Man's Views on Dating."

In the video, Asher flashed his trademark gentle smile at the camera: "I've always been waiting for someone who truly understands me, not caring about appearance, just the connection of souls…"

Daphne turned off the video and went to the innermost part of the closet. There, in a locked drawer, she entered her birthdate as the password and took out a folder.

Inside was the equity certificate of StarTech Innovations—the inheritance from her parents, accounting for 27% of the company's total shares, valued at approximately 380 million yuan.

Over the years, she had never touched this wealth, choosing instead to support her husband's "career" from the shadows.

Outside, Asher was bidding farewell to team members, his laughter clearly reaching up.

Daphne stood behind the curtains, watching him embrace a young female assistant, his hand lingering on her waist for an unusually long time.

A decision took shape in her heart. She needed to see with her own eyes who her husband really was beyond the camera.
