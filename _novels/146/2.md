Nathan slept alone that night. By noon the next day, Olivia still hadn't returned.

When he woke up, it was still raining outside.

Nathan stayed at home, calmly deleting all the posts about their married life from his social media accounts.

Just as he finished cleaning everything up, he saw that Ethan, who had been threatening to die yesterday, had suddenly posted on social media:

"What's it like to be doted on by your ex-girlfriend?"

He included a grid of nine photos.

In the first, the usually cold and indifferent Olivia was in his arms, feeding him porridge.

In the second, the normally aloof Olivia was sitting by his bedside, holding his hand.

In the third, the usually proud Olivia was kneeling in front of him, her eyes full of concern as she helped him take medicine.

The fourth showed a pile of luxury goods, each worth millions. Ethan had captioned it: "Thanks to Olivia's connections, I'm not angry or upset anymore."

In the photos, the handsome man smiled sweetly, looking like the happiest prince on a phone call.

The comment section was full of envious remarks:

"Left and experienced hardships, returned and it's still true love. Ethan, did you save the galaxy in your past life?"

"No way! It must have been at least ten galaxies. Ethan, how did you manage to make your ex still so devoted to you?"

Besides the envy, there were naturally some who wanted to mock Nathan.

Nathan just glanced over them briefly, a few comments catching his eye:

"I wonder how Mr. Xu feels seeing all this?"

"What could a mere substitute feel? Did he really think that by stepping in to save face as the groom, he could win the heart of the Sullivan family's princess? He's probably dying of jealousy right now. Want to bet how many minutes before this lapdog shows up?"

"I bet 10 minutes!"

"I bet 5 minutes!"

"I bet 1 minute! He's probably already downstairs. I'll stake my new Lamborghini on it!"

Many people eagerly joined in the betting, with the stakes getting higher and higher.

But Nathan just smiled resignedly. He would soon no longer be "Mr. Sullivan" in others' eyes, so why chase after a woman who didn't belong to him?

So Nathan quickly typed out a response on his phone:

"I bet he won't show up for a lifetime."

His words stirred up a storm, with many people immediately messaging to ask if he was joking.

Nathan simply turned off his phone and stopped looking at any messages.

Instead, he turned to make himself a bowl of noodles.

Just then, the phone suddenly rang.

Nathan didn't answer, but the calls kept coming non-stop for five or six minutes before finally stopping.

But soon after, the housekeeper Mrs. Zhang came in holding her own phone, looking troubled.

"Sir, the young miss wants you to answer the phone."

Only then did Nathan pick up the phone and answer.

"Nathan, it's all a misunderstanding. I already made Ethan delete those posts. Don't overthink it. He was feeling very unwell yesterday, that's why I didn't come home. Nothing happened between us."

Olivia's anxious voice came through the phone. The moment she saw Nathan's comment, she had panicked.

Nathan looked at the noodles he had made and calmly said, "I made noodles. Are you coming home to eat?"

Olivia was stunned for a moment before replying, "I'm glad you're not angry. You can eat the noodles yourself. Ethan's heart is hurting again, so I'm taking him to the hospital for a check-up. Don't worry, we're really just frie-"

Before she could finish, Ethan's panicked voice came through on the other end.

"Olivia, where are you? I can't see you. Did I lose you again? My heart feels so anxious."

The call was abruptly hung up, leaving only Olivia's urgent voice addressing the other end:

"Ethan, I'm right here. You didn't lose me."

Looking at the ended call, Nathan sent Olivia a message: "That document you asked about yesterday is in the glove compartment on your side."

"Open it and you'll see what it is."

It wasn't until two hours later that Olivia finally replied with one sentence:

"No need. Whatever you had me sign, I'm sure it's not to harm me."

This meant she wouldn't look at it.

Of course. Right now she just wanted to be by Ethan's side. Why would she bother looking at anything unrelated to Ethan?

Even though that divorce agreement was right within her reach.

In the afternoon, Nathan drove to follow a truck delivering supplies to the orphanage where he grew up.

Nathan had been an orphan since childhood, raised here.

Seeing Nathan arrive, the children were all very excited, running up to cling to him and share their experiences.

After spending time with the kids, he went to the director's office to say goodbye.

"Mama Director, I'm going abroad for further studies."

The director was very happy. Nathan had been a top student in physics at Tsinghua University, but had suddenly given up studying abroad for a flash marriage. She had been regretful about it for a long time.

"Nathan, that's wonderful news." The director held Nathan's hand, smiling with satisfaction. But then she thought of something and her expression turned worried. "But... you going abroad to study means you and Olivia will be in a long-distance relationship. That can be very difficult."

Nathan looked out the window at a few children playing and running around, shaking his head with a light smile.

"It's not a long-distance relationship. We're getting divorced."

"Because... Ethan came back."

The director was stunned at first, then let out a long sigh, feeling both regretful and relieved.

"I guess I wasn't wrong in my initial assessment. This marriage of yours was never going to last long. You see, once a person still has someone else in their heart, no matter how loving things seem on the surface, it's all fake. As soon as that person comes back, the marriage is over. So it's good that you're divorcing."

She held Nathan's hand sympathetically, comforting him softly.

Nathan smiled back and hugged the director. Yes, it was good that it was ending.
