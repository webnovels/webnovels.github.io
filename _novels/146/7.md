Another day passed. There was just one day left before the divorce cooling-off period ended and Nathan would receive the divorce certificate.

Thinking that he could finally leave, he began mailing his luggage abroad.

Halfway through packing, Olivia called from the office, asking him to attend a high society party at the Sullivan family mansion.

Nathan wanted to refuse. With just one day left, their legal marriage was about to end. But thinking of how Mrs. Sullivan had taken care of him over the years, and that this was the last day after all, Nathan wanted to find a chance to speak with Olivia alone and explain things clearly.

Though the marriage had begun in confusion, Nathan wanted to end it with clarity.

In the bustling Sullivan family estate, everywhere was brightly lit, with elites gathered, clinking glasses.

But as soon as he entered, Nathan didn't see Olivia. After asking around, he learned from an old Sullivan family servant that Olivia was in a house to the north.

Nathan immediately headed in that direction.

The door to the house was slightly ajar, with some suggestive sounds coming from inside.

Nathan suddenly felt a wave of nausea. His body trembled as he slowly peered through the door crack.

Instantly, a jarring scene entered his eyes.

On the sofa, Ethan was roughly and urgently pulling at Olivia's evening gown while pinning her down.

His large hands gripped Olivia's waist as he trailed kisses from her collarbone downwards.

Olivia tilted her head back with closed eyes, frowning. She seemed somewhat resistant, but didn't push him away. Her expression was conflicted.

"Olivia! Promise me you won't leave me."

Ethan murmured. Olivia's eyes suddenly snapped open as she forcefully shoved him away.

"Ethan! What the hell is wrong with you?! I'm married! Why did you come back now? What exactly do you take me for? Something you can toss aside and pick up again whenever you feel like it? Do you know how afraid I am of being alone again?!"

Olivia was furious, but Ethan wouldn't listen. He stubbornly moved forward and embraced her waist again, pressing their bodies together.

"Olivia! I was wrong!"

"Ethan! Get lost!"

Over and over, relentlessly.

Finally, Olivia gave in and surrendered. This time she didn't let Ethan come embrace her.

She forcefully pulled Ethan to her and bit down hard on his lip. Then their lips and tongues intertwined, inseparable.

Moments later, the two finally parted.

Ethan wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and smirked triumphantly. Then he tilted up Olivia's chin.

"So, do you still love me?"

Nathan watched from outside, feeling as if countless knives were stabbing his heart.

Olivia stood frozen for a long while. Eventually, she raised her head and looked at him with eyes full of restrained love. Her tone was one of surrender.

The next moment, her red lips moved: "Yes!"

With that, Ethan's eyes filled with smug satisfaction. He pulled her in for another kiss, then asked,

"So, will you divorce that Nathan and marry me?"

Olivia's entire body suddenly went rigid.

Abruptly, she recalled that wedding years ago that she couldn't bear to remember. She thought of the figure who had resolutely stood up and walked steadily to her side amidst all the strange looks.

"...I."

Olivia turned her head, about to answer.

But in that instant, she saw a pair of grief-stricken eyes gazing at her through the slowly opening door.

All at once, darkness descended in Olivia's mind.

Nathan stood outside, calmly looking at her, tears streaming down his face.

"—Nathan!"
