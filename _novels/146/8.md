Nathan couldn't bear to watch anymore. He also didn't want to know the answer. He turned and walked away.

But the faster he walked, the more that scene replayed in his mind.

Three years ago, they went on a honeymoon to a tropical island.

Just because it was his first time at the beach and he glanced a second too long at some women in bikinis, Olivia's face instantly darkened.

She dragged him back to the presidential suite and didn't let him leave for seven whole days.

After seven days, when they ran out of strawberry-flavored supplies, they moved on. When the bed and sofa broke, they used the floor.

She held him in her arms again and again, eyes red with jealousy: "Nathan, I have everything they have. Don't look at other women. Don't leave me."

He had to swear over and over before her jealousy finally subsided.

Afterwards, Nathan's waist was sore for days, and she teased him about it for weeks.

From that day on, he never dared to look at another woman again. But in his heart, he was overjoyed at Olivia's jealousy.

Now, Nathan finally understood. Her jealousy didn't come from love. She was just afraid of being alone, afraid of standing helplessly on that stage again, not knowing what to do.

He had thought that after deciding to leave, his heart would no longer be moved.

Now... Nathan felt suffocated with pain. He just wanted to get away from this place as quickly as possible.

Never to see her again.

Passing through the bustling area of the Sullivan mansion, Nathan took a deep breath.

He was preparing to make his way through the crowd and leave.

"Nathan."

A voice suddenly came from behind. The familiar tone made Nathan stop in his tracks.

Nathan looked at the speaker, wanting to call her "Mom" but suddenly remembering something. In the end, he respectfully addressed her as "Mrs. Sullivan."

Hearing Nathan's form of address, Mrs. Sullivan sighed but didn't say anything. She just handed Nathan a new ID card.

"Nathan, I've taken care of all the procedures for you to emigrate and study abroad. From now on, the name Nathan Xu will no longer be associated with you. You'll have a completely new identity. Is there anything else you need me to do?"

Nathan looked at the stack of documents in his hand, feeling a great sense of relief.

Perhaps thinking of the scene in that small house earlier.

Or perhaps thinking of the brand new life and identity awaiting him, Nathan's hand began to tremble.

Mrs. Sullivan noticed Nathan's emotional state and asked with concern, "Nathan, what's wrong?"

Nathan took a deep breath to hold back his tears. He put the documents in his pocket and shook his head.

"Thank you so much, Mrs. Sullivan. I'm very grateful for your care all these years and for doing this for me now. I just have one request, please promise me."

Nathan struggled to control his emotions and said softly, "My whereabouts and location - please, please don't tell Olivia."

Nathan and Olivia should never meet again in this lifetime.

Hearing this, Mrs. Sullivan looked at him in shock. "Did something happen between you two again?"

Because just a few days ago, when talking about Olivia, Nathan would still smile.

But now, Mrs. Sullivan could only see extreme disappointment and grief in his eyes.

What could have happened in just a few days?

Thinking of this, Mrs. Sullivan looked Nathan up and down carefully. Her sharp eyes finally noticed the burn marks on Nathan's neck, partially concealed by makeup, and the bandages peeking out from his wrists.

Mrs. Sullivan was stunned. Worry evident in her voice, she exclaimed, "Nathan! What happened to cause those injuries?!"

Nathan pulled down his sleeves to cover the bandages on his wrists.

He looked at Mrs. Sullivan solemnly: "Mrs. Sullivan! Please don't ask anything. Just promise me what I asked earlier. I just want to leave quickly without causing any more trouble."

Nathan didn't tell Mrs. Sullivan about what happened in the small house.

Since he was leaving, never to return, what was the point in saying anything?

Or even if he did say something, what good would it do?

Her true love had returned. Even if he left, she probably wouldn't care.

Nathan smiled. "Mrs. Sullivan, thank you for taking care of the immigration paperwork. I'll be going now."

He had barely finished speaking when a female voice suddenly came from behind them. Nathan turned around and found himself looking into Sophie's deep, panicked eyes.

"What immigration?!"
