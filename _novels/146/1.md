Mrs. Sullivan looked at the young man before her, remembering Olivia's wedding three years ago. Ethan, who was supposed to be the groom, had fled abroad at the last minute.

Just as Olivia stood awkwardly on stage, red-eyed and unsure what to do, Nathan had put on an ill-fitting suit and slowly walked up.

He apologetically took the microphone and addressed all the guests: "I'm so sorry, there was traffic on the way. I'm late."

With that act, he had saved Olivia's dignity and the Sullivan family's reputation.

Mrs. Sullivan let out a long sigh, then asked uncertainly, "Will Olivia agree to the divorce?"

Nathan shook his head with a smile. "I already got her to sign the divorce papers."

Two weeks ago, he had given her the divorce agreement. At the time, Olivia was in a rush to finish work and meet Ethan. She had signed without even looking and left.

Now, in just seven more days, he would be able to get the official divorce certificate. He would be free.

After all, the Sullivan family had a three-generation military background and couldn't go abroad.

So once he left the country, he and Olivia would never have to see each other again.

Just as Mrs. Sullivan was about to speak, a gentle female voice came from behind them.

"Nathan, what are you chatting about with Mom?"

Nathan turned around to see Olivia, whom he hadn't seen in days, walking towards them in a black evening gown that occasionally revealed her long legs.

"...Olivia."

Seeing her daughter approach, Mrs. Sullivan was about to step forward to scold her.

"Why are you here?"

With a mix of surprise and reassurance, Nathan stood up, giving Mrs. Sullivan a pleading look to interrupt her.

"I missed you, so I came by to pick you up," Olivia said, her eyes looking a bit guilty. In truth, she had come on purpose after finding out Nathan's whereabouts.

After saying goodbye to the worried Mrs. Sullivan, the couple took their bags and left the Sullivan family home.

On the way back, heavy rain pounded on the car windows, while inside was completely silent.

Olivia remained quiet for a long time before finally speaking.

"Nathan."

"Ethan and I are really over. He just got back to the country and had heart surgery a few years ago, so his health isn't good. As an old... friend, I just went to help him get settled. I hope you can understand."

Nathan stared out the rain-blurred window and nodded.

If only he hadn't seen how Olivia had dropped everything and excitedly rushed to meet Ethan the day he returned.

If only he hadn't noticed Olivia selling the watch she had used for years and replacing it with a cheap bracelet Ethan had given her.

If only...

There were too many "if onlys."

Nathan no longer had any expectations or trust left.

A soft sigh filled the car. Faced with this husband she had married by chance years ago, Olivia wanted to explain further. But thinking of her own actions over the past two weeks, she ultimately chose to change the subject.

"Nathan, what was that document you had me sign two weeks ago?"

As soon as she finished speaking, Nathan turned to look at Olivia, his eyes showing three parts surprise and seven parts bitter amusement.

She was only now remembering to ask about that?

Then again, ever since Ethan came back, everything else in her life had faded into the background. How could she be expected to care about anything else?

Nathan was about to speak when Olivia's phone suddenly rang.

Seeing the name displayed on the car screen, Olivia's face instantly tensed up.

"It's fine, go ahead and answer. It might be something important," Nathan said, looking out the window with an indifferent expression that made Olivia suddenly feel afraid.

But she still answered the call, with the car's speakers automatically broadcasting the conversation.

"Olivia, I miss you so much. It hurts. Can we meet?"

Hearing the whiny tone on the other end, Olivia's knuckles turned white as she gripped the steering wheel. Her expression also suddenly turned cold.

"Ethan, I'm married now. I've told you many times, don't talk to me like that!"

There was a moment of silence on the other end before Ethan replied, "But Olivia, I was supposed to be the groom at that wedding."

The car suddenly screeched to a halt in the middle of the road, the tires making a huge noise as they skidded on the pavement.

In their three years of marriage, this was the first time Nathan had seen Olivia lose control. She shouted at the screen:

"But you left! You abandoned me and left!"

The phone went completely silent.

A moment later, Ethan's voice came back sounding choked up: "I'm sorry. I was sick at the time and didn't want you to worry. I had no idea it would have such serious consequences."

"Ah! Olivia! My heart hurts so much. It's okay, just let me die like this. Then I won't bother you anymore, and you can live happily with my substitute."

Soon, there was no more sound from the other end. Olivia instantly panicked. She immediately looked at Nathan.

Nathan spoke up first: "It's fine, I'll take a taxi home. You go check on him. Don't let anything really happen."

Olivia still felt somewhat guilty and said softly, "I'm not going to see him. I just remembered there's an urgent matter at the company, so I need to stop by there."

"I'll come back to be with you after I finish."

Nathan nodded and opened the car door to get out.

Watching her car speed away, Nathan stood in the rain holding an umbrella, his eyes darkening.

A moment later, he gave a bitter smile and started walking towards home, over ten miles away.

Three years. It was time to end it.

Three years ago, he had put on that ill-fitting suit and married a woman who could barely remember his name.

Friends and relatives privately said Nathan was pitiful, just a stand-in for his wife's true love.

But in the three years since, they had shared romantic moments together and dreamed of the future.

Nathan had thought he had melted the heart of this so-called ice queen.

But now, Nathan clearly knew he had been wrong.

If that was the case, he should return to where he truly belonged and give back this position as Mr. Sullivan.

It would fulfill Olivia's wishes.

And free himself as well.

Lightning split the night sky, followed closely by torrential rain that swept through like a tidal wave.

It also washed away the last of Nathan's feelings for Olivia.
