I gave birth on the same day as my best friend.

She delivered a healthy, chubby baby boy weighing 8 pounds 6 ounces. The Evans Group lavished her with endless wealth and glory as a reward.

I, on the other hand, gave birth to a stillborn baby with deformities, causing my husband Lucas, the heir to the Evans Group, to lose his position.

On the day of the baby shower, Mia cradled her chubby baby boy in front of me, mocking and cursing me.

She called me a barren hen, saying I was born to bring bad luck.

I couldn't stand it and argued with her, but she pushed me onto a fruit knife, causing me to bleed to death.

It wasn't until after my death that I learned the truth - she had switched our babies.

Her goal was for her husband to replace us and become the CEO of Evans Group.

When I opened my eyes again, I was back before my due date.
