Outside, Julian was still there. His lips moved, saying something. But my ears were ringing, my steps unsteady, and I had no energy to pay attention to him, no energy to process the situation.

I could only respond, my words tumbling out, disjointed and slurred: "Ears… hurt so much. Can't hear."

Even my hearing aid was useless.

Julian's eyes widened with urgency, and some other emotion I couldn't quite grasp. Before I could make sense of it, I fainted.

I had a dream. The dream was chaotic yet familiar.

A woman lay in a bathtub, gently beckoning to me. I ran to her, calling "Mom," and heard her sigh, "If only I couldn't hear anything, it would be so much better."

How could not hearing be better? Mom, I don't understand.

As I drew closer, I saw her skin was ashen, and the bathtub was filled with blood. Empty pill bottles were scattered across the cold, damp floor. 

I stumbled back a few steps, falling down the stairs. From then on, my ears heard no sound; the whole world seemed even quieter than a winter's night.

Looking up again, the scene suddenly shifted, but the empty pill bottles were still at my feet. 

Someone picked one up, shook a few pills into their mouth, and chewed them like candy. I cried out, rushing towards him, snatching the pills from his hand. 

"These are bitter. Little brother, I'll give you candy, okay?"

He took the candy, silently shedding tears, not speaking.

The scene shifted again. A beautifully dressed girl smirked and said to the person next to her, "That little deafy is always so dull, so boring. Why don't we cut her skirt?"

Suddenly, someone grabbed my hand from behind. 

I couldn't hear his voice, but his palm felt so warm and strong. Hope and joy surged in my heart, and I turned around, calling out, "Leo!"

He affectionately ruffled my hair, smiling brightly.

However, the next instant, his eyes turned cold, and he pushed me forward! I fell into a torrent of churning lava. Burning, painful, terrifying, bewildered.

 I couldn't break free.

In a blur, I felt parched. Suddenly, a soft, damp touch brushed my lips, bringing a comforting coolness.

 I used all my strength, my limbs wrapping around him, like a child desperate for candy, clinging on and refusing to let go. 

I ground against him, constantly taking, swallowing those few drops of moisture with desperate whimpers.

But that coolness quickly turned to scorching heat, accompanied by deep gasps and unrestrained affection.

"Hot," I frowned, pulling away.

"Little Apple…" someone whispered softly.

I stubbornly tried to move away. That person sighed, a helpless yet indulgent sound, incredibly gentle. When he returned, he carefully wiped my forehead, hands, and feet with an alcohol-scented damp towel, repeating the motion tirelessly.

Until I escaped the nightmare and fell into a peaceful sleep.

I woke up the next morning. I was at Julian's suburban mansion. He explained, "I was worried the night emergency room wouldn't take good care of you, so I took the liberty of bringing you here and calling my family doctor."

I nodded, then heard him say, "Ms. Hayes, I'm hosting a dinner party here tomorrow night. Would you consider being my escort?"

I instinctively wanted to escape. "I want to go back to school. My graduation project isn't finished yet…"

Julian thought for a moment, his expression serious.

 "This is a suburban area; you won't be able to get a cab. And given the current fluctuations in your hearing, I can't let you drive back alone. That would violate traffic safety laws."

…He had a point, and he had taken such good care of me yesterday. I couldn't refuse. I could only carefully ask, "Will Leo be there tomorrow?"

"Do you want to see him? If you don't…"

"No, no!" I quickly waved my hand. "It's fine." Julian had been so kind to take care of me when I was ill. Who was I to ask him to cause friction between brothers?

Julian didn't speak. After a long moment, he let out a soft, cool chuckle, and his gentle, clear eyes became unreadable.

"Alright," he said. "If you wish, then he'll come."
