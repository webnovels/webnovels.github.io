It was Valentine's Day, and I went to the hospital for a follow-up.

"Ms. Hayes, your hearing has recovered to 60%. You can gradually stop using your hearing aid from now on."

I was practically bursting with joy at the news. My first thought was to tell Leo.

But sitting in the hospital hallway, I called him three times in a row, and each call was rejected.

 I waited for a long time, but there was still no reply in our SnapChat chat.

Disappointed, I finally put my phone away.

Unexpectedly, as soon as I stepped out of the hospital, I bumped into Julian Hayes.

The man leaned against his car, tall and imposing, with a sharp, cold face. Dressed in a perfectly tailored suit, every move he made exuded an effortless grace and aristocratic charm that drew admiring glances from passersby.

"Mr. Hayes." I greeted him, feeling a little stiff. "What a coincidence."

Julian Hayes, the youngest CEO of The Hayes Corporation. I'd heard Leo complain more than once about how his brother was a cold-blooded, ruthless corporate shark.

At this moment, the handsome corporate shark pursed his lips and suddenly asked, "Are you planning to celebrate with Leo tonight?"

I answered, flustered, "Leo hasn't replied to my messages. He's probably still busy…"

Julian let out an almost imperceptible scoff. Seeing my confused gaze, he softened his voice, his tone laced with a hint of something tempting.

"It's alright. I'm not busy now. I'll take you to him."

Julian drove me to an exclusive club. As I was getting out of the car, he suddenly called my name.

"Ms. Hayes." The emotion in his eyes was dark and unreadable. "Do you truly, genuinely like him that much?"

I froze for a moment, then smiled. "Yes, I like him a lot."

I met Leo in high school. Back then, because of my hearing loss, I was bullied at school. Once, soaked to the bone and shivering like a drowned rat, covered in foul mop water, a confident, handsome boy appeared as if from nowhere. 

He took off his jacket and draped it over my head.

Through my damaged hearing aid, I couldn't hear anything, but I knew the hand that pulled me up was incredibly warm and strong. 

My young heart fluttered like a butterfly, soft and hopeful, stirred by that unexpected kindness.

Years passed, and he remained as he was that first day.

Julian watched me silently for a few seconds, then lowered his gaze. "Go on in. It's cold out here."

Before I could say anything, he had already floored the gas pedal and driven towards the parking lot. I had no choice but to take the gift I'd prepared for Leo and walk into the club.

From the slightly ajar door, flickering lights spilled out, and the smell of smoke and alcohol hit me. 

Leo was surrounded by people, his eyes slightly narrowed, a lazy, almost bored expression on his face.

I reached out to push the door open, but then I stopped.

Sitting next to Leo was a woman. Her back was to me, her figure tall and elegant, her face unseen. Only a cascade of red hair shone under the shifting lights, like silk.

A strange unease settled in my stomach.

Then I heard someone laugh loudly, "Scarlett, you don't stand a chance. Leo's already hooked by Little Apple. He's a taken man now!"

Suddenly, my ears felt hot.

My name is Audrey.

Little Apple. That was me.

Leo was naturally carefree and wild. Before we dated, he drank, smoked, raced cars…

 indulging in every pleasure imaginable. 

As for girlfriends, he'd change them weekly, never truly caring. Only after he confessed his feelings for me did he calm down a lot. 

Even his friends would tease him, "Leo's quieter than a mouse around his girlfriend. He'll probably be totally whipped later on."

At that moment, I shouldn't have doubted him.

The Ms. Scarlett with her back to me let out a soft chuckle.

 Her voice sounded sweet and delicate, with a hint of defiance. "Leo, are you really with her?"

Leo lifted his eyelids, giving her a dismissive glance, his expression cold.

 He took a sip of his drink before saying, "Audrey? She's just a boring, utterly unappealing deaf girl. Honestly, playing with her was a total drag."
