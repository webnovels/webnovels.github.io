The Hayes family, true to their name, were the epitome of power and wealth in this city's most affluent district. 

The room glittered with opulent gowns and sparkling jewels, filled with the murmur of conversations and the clinking of champagne flutes. The only downside was running into Scarlett.

With no one nearby, she dropped her gentle facade.

 "Talking about breaking up with Leo, but still sniffing around like a stray dog. Audrey, do you even belong here? Are you worthy?"

I didn't want to get into it with her and turned to leave. A flash of malice crossed Scarlett's eyes, and she actually grabbed my hair and yanked it back. "Did I say you could leave? Years apart, and your guts have certainly grown."

I was trembling with rage and tightly gripped Scarlett's hand. My nails dug into her skin, leaving several clear red marks. Scarlett cried out in pain, her fury intensifying.

 She violently flung my hair away, tearing off my left hearing aid in the process.

 My hearing, which had been gradually recovering, had already faded due to the previous shock. Without a hearing aid now, I was completely deaf.

"Stop!" My eyes burned red with fury as I tried to stop her.

However, in the next instant, Scarlett's high heel stomped fiercely on my hearing aid, grinding it into pieces.

"You…" I gasped for air, enraged. "You're going too far!"

Scarlett actually smiled sweetly. "Oh, and what of it?"

A fiery rage surged through me, threatening to consume me whole. I raised my hand and swung it, aiming for her temple!

"Audrey!" I heard Leo shout from not far away.

The commotion was quite loud, and scattered groups of people in the distance turned to look. Scarlett stood there, a bright red handprint on her face, utterly stunned.

Leo quickly walked over, his face somewhat grim. He shielded Scarlett behind him. "Audrey, what are you doing?"

My tone was cold. "What am I doing? Didn't you see?"

Leo sighed, softening his voice a little. "I know you came here specifically for me today. But in a place like this, you really shouldn't make such a scene. Audrey, apologize to Scarlett, and I'll forgive you, okay?"

For a moment, I didn't react. Then it dawned on me—he probably thought I had gone to all this trouble to show up here just to find a chance to get back together with him.

Could a person's cheek be this thick?

"Leo, I remember telling you," I said, every word slow and deliberate, "we're already broken up."

Leo's eyes darkened. "Audrey, don't make a fuss. Apologize."

I almost scoffed. "Leo, do you want a slap too?"

Leo abruptly seized my wrist, his expression clouded with dark fury. "Audrey, if you don't back down, you'll really lose your chance."

The next moment, someone chuckled from a distance. Leo looked behind me, his face suddenly changing.

Julian walked forward with a relaxed stride, wrapping an arm around my shoulders. His voice, unwavering like mountains and seas, spoke. "In that case, next time you see her, remember to call her sister-in-law."


Leo and Scarlett were escorted out by security. The expressions on their faces as they left were a mix of shock and rage.

Leo even yelled hoarsely, "Audrey, you can hate me, but you can't choose him! What kind of good guy is Julian Hayes?!"
