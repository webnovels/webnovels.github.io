Every word was slow, every syllable clear.

It felt like I'd been punched square in the gut; I couldn't react. The room fell silent, everyone staring at Leo in shock.

Ms. Scarlett chuckled again. "Is that so? I heard she's been with you for quite a while."

Leo's face held a carefree smile, casual and unconcerned. 

"So what? She's like an apple – not bad, but so boring, completely unappetizing. No one would actively seek one out, but if someone hands one to you, would you really refuse?"

I stood rooted to the spot, utterly disbelieving.

 A chill swept through me, sinking deep into my bones. The world around me started to blur, the sounds fading into a distant hum.

 In a daze, I thought I heard Ms. Scarlett ask, her voice playfully whiny, "If she's a boring apple, then what am I?"

Leo hooked her chin, his smile dangerously seductive. "You, my dear, are my little cherry."

My body trembled uncontrollably, and the gift in my hand slipped, clattering to the floor.

Everyone in the room turned to look at me. 

Leo froze for a second, then quickly regained his composure and started walking towards me. 

He didn't know I had heard all those words. Because I wasn't sure if the treatment would work, I had never told him that my hearing was gradually returning.

My mind went blank. I didn't know what to do, only frantically fumbling in my bag for my hearing aid.

 It was as if putting on the hearing aid would give me a sense of security.

When I looked up again, Scarlett stood before me. She smiled, her eyes sparkling. "What's with that expression? Ms. Hayes, don't you recognize me?"

My whole body trembled, my limbs stiff. It felt like I was naked, thrown into a brutal winter storm, every breath a struggle. 

The woman before me was strikingly beautiful, her smile open and generous, like a kind and pure princess of noble birth. But I knew the wicked heart beneath that mask!

It was overturned meals, foul-smelling sewage, never-ending ridicule and pranks, wanton insults and rumors… How could it be her? It really was her!

I used every ounce of strength I had to keep standing.


 Then I asked Leo, who was standing to the side, "She led the bullying against me in high school. Did you know?"

Scarlett stood smiling. Her expression was gentle, but her eyes held a hint of mockery.

Leo's gaze flickered, avoiding mine. His tone was casual. "Is that so? Was there such a thing? I don't really remember…"

In that instant, I saw through Leo's expression. 

My mind became crystal clear. I shook my head, a tearful smile on my face, correcting him. "You remember perfectly. You knew everything."

It was just that his heart had drifted away.

Leo frowned. "Scarlett's personality is a bit direct, but back then, it was just kids playing around. Audrey, don't be so sensitive. Besides, why would Scarlett specifically target you? Were you at fault first?"

The scars he had personally witnessed were now reduced to mere "sensitivity." He even turned it around, asking if I was at fault first. 

I used to believe that the most precious thing in the world was true affection. But it turns out, hearts can be so fickle, so easily swayed.

"Leo, you disgust me." My chest felt hollowed out, as if a knife had carved out my very soul, but my resolve was stronger than ever. "We're breaking up."

Leo's face instantly darkened, his eyes clouding with an ominous anger. "Breaking up?" He scoffed. "Audrey, who do you think would want you besides me?"

My face was pale, my head throbbing with pain, as I quickly turned and left.

"Audrey, don't you dare regret this!"

I wouldn't. Leo, I might be weak, but I will never regret this.
