Mrs. Thompson asked: "How is Lucas treating you? Is he bullying you?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes and didn't mention being choked by Lucas.

She just complained: "It's all because of those rumors before, saying Lucas had bipolar disorder, was weird and antisocial, and would beat people! It was all nonsense. Lucas is gentle and considerate, and very generous too. He just gave me a black card. That little bitch Aria really lucked out before."

"Mom, it was all her fault for stealing my identity. I couldn't even use my own name for these three years. I want to find a psychic to curse her so she can never find peace even in death."

I looked at my semi-transparent body and couldn't help but laugh bitterly. Wasn't this already a state of unrest?

Three years ago, when I married Lucas, Evelyn had her name changed and was sent abroad to lay low. Originally, it was said that she had married a foreigner, but later that man ran away owing huge gambling debts, leaving her to pay them off.

Evelyn raised her eyebrows and smiled: "Anyway, Lucas and the Gray family were supposed to be mine. It's just returning to the rightful owner. Aria, don't blame me for being ruthless."

Returning to the rightful owner.

How ridiculous.

When Evelyn refused to marry Lucas, I was pinned to the operating table, feeling the cold surgical knife moving across my face, gradually removing all traces of Aria.

Later, when Evelyn was burdened with huge debts and saw me appearing in public with Lucas in the news media, she regretted her decision.

She admired the cold and noble Lucas, while also hating me for having her face.

That night, Evelyn, who had finally gotten what she wanted, slept soundly.

Early the next morning, she carefully dressed up and prepared a sumptuous meal to take to Lucas's company.

Before leaving, she sprayed my perfume heavily.

The receptionist only took a few minutes to announce her arrival before Lucas came out to greet her personally.

He seemed to be in a good mood and asked gently: "Why did you come?"

Evelyn took his arm and smiled sweetly: "Because I missed you. I brought you lunch, let's eat together."

Lucas hummed in agreement and didn't push her hand away. The two walked arm in arm into the office.

I felt a twinge of jealousy.

Lucas didn't like me coming to the company.

I came once at the request of Mr. Gray, but I accidentally broke a cup in his office.

He pinned me to the desk with a gloomy face and tore my dress.

After venting, he said to me, who was completely exhausted: "Aria, know your place. Don't yearn for things you can't have."

I fled in a panic, wrapped in a shawl, and never came back.

How is it that when Evelyn came, he became so gentle?

Evelyn opened the thermal container and laid out the dishes layer by layer, then handed chopsticks to Lucas.

Lucas took the chopsticks and tasted each dish: "It's delicious."

Receiving his praise, Evelyn's eyes curved in happiness as she started eating herself.

Seeing her eating happily, a complex expression flashed in Lucas's eyes: "I remember you said you weren't feeling well before I left on my business trip, feeling nauseous. Are you better now?"

Evelyn hesitated for a moment and explained: "I'm fine now, it was just a bit of gastroenteritis before..."

Lucas pursed his lips and didn't continue this topic.

Instead, he had his assistant bring in a gown and said to Evelyn: "Put this on, I'll take you to an auction later."

An auction?

I suddenly understood. Every time Lucas hurt me during an episode, he would try to make it up to me.

He probably wanted to buy Evelyn some jewelry to compensate for choking her last night.

The camera flashes at the entrance were almost blinding as the CEO of Gray Corporation arrived with his beloved wife for the charity auction.

Evelyn, wearing a haute couture gown and holding Lucas's arm, smiled sweetly at the cameras.

This was the life she had always dreamed of, and she finally got it.

Lucas took Evelyn to a private box on the second floor. They stood on the balcony of the box, looking towards the central stage.

Jade jewelry, antique paintings, it was dazzling.

Under the dim yellow lights, Lucas's expression seemed particularly gentle.

He held Evelyn's waist and placed a restrained kiss on her crimson lips, his eyes soft and affectionate: "Aria, choose something you like for the baby. Don't hide it from me anymore, I know everything."

Evelyn was stunned.

I was stunned too.

She had a moment of confusion: "Know what? What baby?"

Lucas reached out to touch her abdomen: "I haven't touched you lately because I was afraid of hurting the baby. Don't worry, I won't let you get rid of it. Will you keep the baby for me?"

Evelyn's face turned a bit pale.

She almost instinctively, in disbelief, said: "You mean she... I'm pregnant?"
