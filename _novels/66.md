My younger sister became infatuated with stories about real and fake heiresses after finishing college. She convinced herself that she was the lost daughter of a Noble Aristocrat, living a life of luxury. She acted like an heiress, treating our mother as her maid, our father as her chauffeur, and using me as her emotional outlet. She even went to great lengths to prove that she wasn't biologically part of the Johnson Family.

Later, she heard that a Noble Aristocrat family was searching for their daughter, missing for eighteen years. She forged her ID and household registration, managing to pose as a twenty-year-old college student despite being twenty-four. She wept her way to their doorstep but was immediately exposed as a fraud and thrown out.

Soon afterward, at the recognition banquet for the Aristocrat’s daughter, my sister disguised herself as a server and attacked the true heiress. To reduce her sentence, our family sold the house and cars, drained our savings, only for her to give us a bottle of cyanide upon her release.
