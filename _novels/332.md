The year Gabriel Grant loved me the most.
During evening study hall, I was accidentally locked in the pitch-black dormitory building. He stood outside the window, singing all night to comfort me.
Later, on the day we were supposed to celebrate our anniversary.
He abandoned me and rented out a bar.
For a private concert dedicated to his childhood friend.
Singing the love song he once wrote only for me.
When I opened my eyes again, I was back in that night when I was trapped.
A bucket of cold water poured down from the window.
"Shut up, you sound terrible."
Today was supposed to be the day Gabriel Grant and I celebrated our anniversary.
We had invited only our closest friends and family.
I forced a smile on my face, wearing an uncomfortably tight dress and high heels. After bustling about for two hours and downing countless glasses of champagne, I didn't even have time to drink water.
Someone whispered quietly:
"Tsk, the party's almost over and the boyfriend is still nowhere to be seen. I feel so embarrassed for Chloe."
"Well, he is a big star now. It's normal for her to put up with this."
"But this is too much. Who doesn't show up to their own anniversary party?"
They were right.
This was a celebration without the other half of the couple.
Because Gabriel Grant never showed up from beginning to end.
I tried hard to suppress the churning in my stomach, my palms sweating as I kept calling Gabriel.
Usually, even if he had a schedule, his manager would contact me in advance.
But not today. There had been no word from him all day.
More than anything else, I was worried something had happened to him.
When it was over, my parents didn't look too happy.
Our family had always cared about face, so they never approved of my relationship with Gabriel from the start.
"I really don't know what you're thinking, choosing someone like him. You've embarrassed our entire family."
Before leaving, my mom held my hand and said earnestly: "Chloe, you know best about your own feelings. It's not too late to turn back now."
My eyes were moist, but I forced a smile.
"Mom, Dad, Gabriel just had something urgent come up. I'll bring him home another day, and you can scold him then."
After all the guests had left.
I called Gabriel's manager while stuffing leftover food into my mouth.
Until the call was disconnected again due to no answer.
I took a deep breath, staring blankly at the dark phone screen, my heart sinking heavily.
My best friend Jenny Johnson walked over angrily and handed me her phone.
"Look at this."
