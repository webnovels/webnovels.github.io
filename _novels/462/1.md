In the peak of summer, the cicadas were chirping loudly outside.

Emily tossed and turned, but was jolted awake by a stinging pain in her fingertip.

Fully awake now, she felt thoroughly annoyed. Today had been truly unlucky. While grocery shopping in the afternoon, some brat had put a needle on the seat of a rental bike, pricking her when she sat down. Then when she got home, her mother-in-law Margaret criticized her for not even being able to make a proper salad. In her flustered state, she had accidentally cut her finger while cooking.

The cicadas outside grew even louder. Emily gave up on sleep and decided to use the bathroom.

As soon as she stepped out, she heard intense female moaning coming from Margaret's bedroom. She could even faintly make out the sound of flesh slapping against flesh.

Emily was startled. Looking closely, she saw an old pair of men's leather shoes in the entryway. The shoes were a bit worn, with traces of dirt still on them.

It must be her father-in-law George who had returned.

George often traveled for work. Despite being alone at home, Margaret never neglected her appearance. She even had a more extensive makeup collection than Emily. It was understandable that George couldn't resist upon returning.

Emily didn't dare linger. She quickly ducked into the bathroom. When she came out, Margaret's voice hadn't quieted down. In fact, it had grown even more uninhibited. Emily was too embarrassed to stay outside and rushed back to her room without even getting a drink of water.

Looking at the pitch-black room and hearing the moans that even the closed door couldn't block out, Emily suddenly felt very empty inside. She also couldn't help but wonder.

David and George both worked at the same research institute. Usually they traveled and returned together. Why had only George come back this time?

The empty double bed held only her body heat. Outside, the cicadas gradually quieted down, and Emily drifted back to sleep.

The next morning, Emily woke up extra early.

George sometimes had to leave quickly for work when he returned home. Worried he might have to rush off again, Emily got up early to make breakfast.

Although she and Margaret didn't get along well, George had always been kind. Emily's relationship with Margaret was maintained largely thanks to George and David's mediation. Emily felt very grateful towards George.

After I set out the steamed buns and porridge on the table and turned to get Margaret's soy milk, I heard Margaret shouting again outside.

"Other people's daughters-in-law are frugal homemakers. But you just have to put on a grand feast for breakfast, as if you're serving the emperor! I bet you're just some country bumpkin who's never seen the world, trying to freeload off our family!"

The anger immediately rose in Emily's chest.

Emily had been abandoned at an orphanage as a newborn and adopted by a kind rural couple at age ten. After graduating college, she moved to the city for work and later married David.

After marriage, David and George often traveled for work. Margaret used the excuse of poor health to force Emily to quit her job and become a full-time housewife.

Emily had acquiesced to her wishes, but Margaret's nitpicking never stopped. Whenever David was away for work, Margaret would find fault with everything Emily did at home, always accusing her of being a freeloader.

Emily walked out of the kitchen, slamming down the soy milk forcefully. She was about to argue back when she caught sight of her wedding ring. The fire in her heart slowly died down.

Although Margaret had always looked down on her, Emily had seen David's care and love for her over the years.

Moreover, before he left last time, he had told her to wait just one more month. Once he finished his current work, he would take her to move out and live as a couple.

Emily took a deep breath and patiently explained: "I didn't mean to make so much. I just heard Father-in-law come home last night, so this extra portion of breakfast..."

Before Emily could finish speaking, Margaret suddenly stood up, grabbed the soy milk that had been placed on the table, and threw it in Emily's face.

"You little hussy, are you trying to act up?! You haven't even given our family an heir yet and you're already trying to manipulate me? Let me tell you, you'd better behave yourself, or I'll make David kick you out of this house sooner or later!"

Over the years, Margaret had inexplicably given Emily a hard time, but she had rarely been this directly physical. Emily was stunned for a moment. Meanwhile, Margaret sat down as if she had won a victory and began picking at her breakfast.

Emily gritted her teeth and swallowed her anger.

Fine, in just one more month David would take her to move out. There was no benefit to falling out with Margaret at this point.

Emily suppressed her anger and went back to her room to change clothes. Behind her, Margaret let out a cold snort, as if certain Emily wouldn't dare do anything to her.
