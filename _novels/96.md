James's first love was diagnosed with a terminal illness and didn't have much time left.

Just as we were about to board a plane for a family vacation, James received the news and immediately abandoned his family, leaving them with me while he rushed to be by his ex's side.

Furious, I suggested we break up. He retorted, "She's dying. Is it too much to ask that I help her complete her bucket list?"

Later, after fulfilling his ex's last wishes, he knocked on my door and asked if I was still angry.

The little munchkin behind me mimicked my response in a cute voice: "Go cool off somewhere else!"
