My daughter was a jinx. 
The first word she ever spoke, as a toddler, was "die."
No one took it seriously at the time, but the very next day, her grandpa was hit by a truck and killed.
When my daughter started kindergarten, her second sentence was: "The snow by the door is red."
Her grandma went downstairs for a walk and was instantly killed by a flowerpot falling from an upstairs window.
Blood spilled everywhere, staining the white snow crimson.
My husband was distraught; he wanted to get rid of our daughter.
My daughter then uttered her third sentence: "Daddy, watch out for cars."
My husband was terrified, not daring to step out of the house. 
But he tripped on a toy car in the living room, suffered a brain hemorrhage, and died on the spot.
I cried, begging my daughter to shut up, to stop cursing her own family.
But her expression remained cold, devoid of any remorse.
"Mommy, don't go near fire."
I completely broke down. On Christmas Eve, I climbed onto the rooftop.
I didn't want to burn to death, so I chose my own way to die.
But as I jumped, someone below was setting off fireworks.
The brilliant fireworks exploded, hitting me, and I plummeted to my death amidst the shocked screams of onlookers.
My daughter stood on the rooftop, watching me, her face utterly expressionless.
Even in death, I couldn't understand why the daughter I had cared for so meticulously would curse our entire family.
When I opened my eyes again, I was back to the day my daughter first learned to speak.
This time, I finally understood what was going on with my daughter's jinx!
