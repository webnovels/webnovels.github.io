Chapter 1

After the reunion, my wife’s high school sweetheart wrecked his car.

My wife, a lawyer, told me to get behind the wheel and take the blame.

“Ethan's got points on his license, Liam. Just take the hit for him, okay?”

“If there are any legal issues, I’ll defend you.”

I didn't argue. I just stared at her as she led her precious Ethan away.

Last time, I fought back, convinced her not to ask me to lie.

But the accident wasn't so simple.

He was drunk and killed six people. He got eight years and jumped off the prison roof.

My wife acted like he deserved it, but on our anniversary, she slipped poison into my dinner.

“It’s your fault! If you hadn’t been so stubborn that night, Ethan would still be alive!”

I died full of despair. Then I woke up again, back to the moment she asked me to lie.

This time, she still chose her first love.

But this time, I’m done with her.

“Liam, baby, Ethan’s license… Could you just say you were driving? He's really in a bind.”

My wife of seven years, Ashley, adjusted her glasses and casually asked me to take the fall for her precious Ethan.

Looking at that beautiful face, the one I'd once loved more than anything, all I felt was cold.

“Do I have to?”

I barely whispered the words, but Ethan, who was practically leaning on Ashley, exploded.

“If he doesn’t want to, forget it. I can handle it myself.”

His hands were shaking; I definitely noticed.

Ashley saw it, too.

She sighed, her eyes full of pity for him.

When she looked at me, it was with disapproval.

“Liam, you're usually so helpful! Why can’t you do this little favor?”

I managed a weak smile.

Being helpful and taking the blame for a crime are two different things.

Especially when it involves her ex!

Ashley didn’t seem to care about my feelings. Seeing my hesitation, she decided to play the emotional card.

“You know Ethan is my best friend in this city. He has always been looking after me.”

“He’s an only child. He just finished his exams, he’s about to get his dream job. He can't have this on his record!”

“It's not that big of a deal. You're a freelancer, it won't affect you. Just help him out.”

“You two are the same build. It's my car, no one will question it.”

She sounded so sure of herself, and my heart sank further. I had to ask, “Ashley, are you sure it's just a minor accident?”

They exchanged a look, a hint of guilt flashing between them.

Ashley forced a smile. “Yeah, it was just a fender bender. It was dark, Ethan hit a guardrail.”

“Just say you were driving. Pay a fine, maybe spend a day or two in jail.”

I watched her lie to me, and asked quietly, “What about my mom? She's still in the hospital.”

My mom made Ashley falter, but her concern for Ethan won out. Ashley avoided my gaze. “I’ll take care of your mom. Don’t you trust me?”

“I know you’re tight on cash, with your mom in the hospital. Right?”

“If you agree to help Ethan, I’ll give you… or Ethan will give you, $30,000. How’s that?”

Ashley knew I wouldn’t refuse.

My mom has a bad heart, and she’d been in the hospital recently, which wiped out most of my savings.

I knew Ashley had money, but I never thought about asking her.

Hearing her say that made me sick.

Ethan was unemployed. Where would he get $30,000?

Ashley would pay it.

My mom has always been nice to her. She was using my mom to manipulate me!

I stared at her, knowing that if I refused, I’d arouse suspicion. I didn’t say anything, just got into the beat-up BMW.

Ashley and Ethan looked relieved.

Before leaving, Ethan gave me a fake bow, saying he’d treat me to a fancy dinner when this was all over.

There would be no fancy dinner.

Ashley lied. She abandoned me to protect Ethan.

From the moment she asked me to take the blame, I knew we were both reliving something.

Last time, Ethan caused a wreck, but it wasn't just some guardrail.

He was drunk after the reunion, speeding, and plowed into six pedestrians. No one survived.

If he was caught, he’d spend years in prison.

The location was remote, the only security camera was blurry.

Last time, Ashley asked me to take the blame.

I refused, mentioning my mom and our family. If something went wrong, it would affect our future.

Ashley gave up.

Ethan was caught, convicted, and jumped off the roof, a broken mess.

Ashley said, “He deserved it.”

I thought she was a righteous lawyer. Then, on our anniversary, she poisoned my food.

Clutching my chest, I stared at her in disbelief. She sneered.

“Ethan died in agony, without a funeral! It’s all your fault!”

“If you had taken the blame, he wouldn’t have been sentenced so harshly! He would still be alive!”

“Why should you live, when my Ethan suffered?”

I would never forget the burning pain of the poison, her furious accusations.

I did nothing wrong. But Ashley killed me because I wouldn’t lie for her ex.

Now, she made the same choice.

For Ethan, she sacrificed seven years of marriage and me.

Memories of our relationship flashed through my mind, ending on her face as she coached me.

“Just say you picked me up after the reunion. You were looking at your phone.”

“Don’t mention Ethan, got it?”

Ashley seemed worried, and she kept reminding me.

I stared at her familiar face, speechless.

Ashley grew impatient.

“You agreed to help, so stop making a scene.”

“I’m warning you, if you mess this up and drag Ethan down, I’ll never forgive you!”

Her blaming me made my heart freeze.

She ran out of patience.

“Wait here for the cops. I’m taking Ethan home.”

She helped Ethan away.

I laughed, feeling like I never knew her.

We met at work.

I was a freelancer who had lost $20,000 to a scam, and Ashley was the lawyer.

Fresh out of law school, she vowed to get my money back.

She did, and we fell in love.

I remember proposing. She was ecstatic, promising to love me forever.

We promised to stay together forever.

She was a strong woman at work, but at home, she was a cuddly girl.

I made her happy.

Her parents, who had thought my job was unstable, changed their minds.

“Ashley, don’t bully Liam.”

Ashley hugged me. “He likes it. I’ll bully him forever, right?”

I nodded.

We were happy, and I believed she loved me.

But her "forever" lasted until Ethan came back.

I should have seen it coming.

The old necklace she always wore, the song she loved, "Love and Honesty," revealed her feelings.

When they reunited, Ashley dropped my hand.

She looked guilty, and avoided Ethan’s eyes.

Ethan smiled awkwardly, and made small talk.

I asked Ashley about it.

She said they were young and foolish. I believed her.

After that, she and Ethan didn’t seem to contact each other.

She was a top lawyer, smart and capable.

Hiding a past love wouldn’t be hard.

I was fooled, until everything fell apart, and I realized that Ashley and Ethan couldn't compare to me.

I tried to control myself, but I teared up.

I wanted to ask her why, but I knew the answer.

She loved him.

I was just someone to marry.

Those little things, once sweet, were a trap, and I fell for it.

I slammed the steering wheel, watched them leave, and pulled out my phone.

“Mom, I want a divorce.”

My mom was shocked.

“What? You and Ashley seemed happy.”

“Tell me the truth. Did you do something wrong?”

My mom liked Ashley, even treating her like a daughter.

Hearing I wanted a divorce, she assumed I was at fault.

I couldn't tell her about Ashley's betrayal.

“Mom, I didn’t do anything wrong, but there are some issues. I’ll tell you later.”

My mom sighed.

“A good home, falling apart.”

I wanted to ask that, too.

But I was the one saying it, and my wife was the one who wants it.

I gripped my phone. Then the car door was knocked on.

A cop told me to get out.

“Were you driving?”

“Do you know what you’ve done?”

He looked disgusted.

If he wasn’t a cop, he would punch me.

I didn’t want to take the blame. I was about to deny it, when a mob of reporters swarmed me.

They took pictures of me.

“Mr. Liam, why did you kill six people?”

“Mr. Liam, did you want to hurt society?”

I couldn’t see. The police handcuffed me and put me in the car.

“No questions. We’ll question him later.”

The cop drove away.

He muttered.

“How did the reporters get here so fast? I don’t even know his name yet.”

I felt a jolt of shock.

How did the reporters know before the police?

Someone told them!

Ashley.

She had media contacts.

My body was shaking.

I thought letting me take the blame was the worst thing she’d do, but Ashley was ruthless!

I had no evidence. If everyone thought I did it, no one would believe me even if I said Ethan was behind it.

I was pale, and the cop asked, “What’s wrong? Realize what you did?”

I shook my head.

“No, it wasn’t me!”

“I didn’t run anyone over!”

The cop paused.

“I’ve heard that before. You don’t want to admit your mistake?”

“If it wasn’t you, why were you in the driver’s seat?”

I took a deep breath and told him everything.

The cop was silent.

He said he’d investigate, and took me to the station.

Outside, reporters and onlookers were waiting.

They were furious, and wanted to throw things at me.

“He killed so many people on purpose!”

“He deserves to die!”

“Why is he wearing a mask? Can’t he show his face?”

I was angry.

Ethan should be responsible.

Why should I suffer for his crime?

The police struggled to get me inside.

Ashley was waiting.

She had a bandage on her head, pretending to be injured. Her eyes were red.

The police glared at me.

Ashley was fast!

She must have said something.

I now knew how ruthless she could be.

She was here to destroy me.

“Honey, I know you’re scared of jail, but it’s happened. You need to take responsibility. If you confess now, you’ll get a lighter sentence!”
