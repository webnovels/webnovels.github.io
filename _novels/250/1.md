When I opened my eyes again, bleeding out, I found myself in the passenger seat of Julian’s car.

He was just hanging up the phone, furious, then slammed his fist against the steering wheel in frustration. He didn't even notice me there.

That’s when it hit me: I was dead. My soul was now tethered to Julian.

It was the first time I’d ever seen him so completely lose his composure.

Julian, who’d remained calm even after his company was sabotaged and he was left bankrupt, was now red-eyed with rage because I’d accidentally deleted Celeste’s chat history.

All because Celeste was the love of his life, his first love who’d died young.

If Julian knew I died because of those chat records, would he still be this frantic?

He sped through the streets, blowing past red lights, until he finally found a phone repair shop that was still open.

“I accidentally deleted some really important chat records. Is there any way to get them back?”

Julian carefully handed his phone to the young man behind the counter. 

The 'guy' took the phone, but didn't say a word for a long time.

“Well? Is it difficult? Name your price, I’ll pay whatever it takes to get them back.” Julian asked anxiously, but then he froze, staring at the repair 'guy.'

The 'guy' awkwardly pulled their cap low, handing the phone back. “I can’t recover them here. You should try somewhere else.”

“Celeste…?” Julian stared, dumbfounded, then his trembling hand reached out and yanked the cap off.

Long hair cascaded down. The 'guy' turned their face away, burying it behind the curtain of hair, their voice muffled and cold. “Sir, you’ve got the wrong person.”

But their trembling voice betrayed them.

Julian couldn't hold back anymore. He lunged over the counter and pulled Celeste tightly into his arms.

“Celeste… it’s really you… This is amazing, you’re alive! Where have you been all these years?”

Even though no one could see me, witnessing my husband embrace another woman as if she were the most precious treasure made my ethereal presence feel utterly pathetic.

But I couldn't move more than a foot and a half away from Julian. I was trapped, forced to watch this agonizing scene.

A flicker of surprise crossed Celeste’s eyes.

She didn't answer, nor did she try to break free from Julian’s embrace.

A moment later, she tentatively replied, “Mr. Lawson, you’re wearing a wedding ring.

 Does it really matter where I’ve been all these years? Did you accidentally delete your wife’s chat records? If her records are still there, they can be recovered.”

At her words, Julian released Celeste.

Celeste offered a knowing, bittersweet smile.

The next second, Julian roughly yanked the wedding ring from his ring finger and, without a second thought, threw it out the door.

Under Celeste’s stunned gaze, Julian gravely took her by the shoulders, looking into her eyes as he said slowly, every word punctuated with gravity:

“Celeste, you’re the only woman I’ve ever wanted to marry. 

But back then, my project secrets were leaked, and I ended up in massive debt. 

Then I suddenly heard about your death. Vera was the one who came up with the money to help me through. 

She’d been secretly in love with me for years, and I had no way to repay her…

Now, my company is thriving. If you’re willing, I can divorce Vera anytime. I don’t care if everyone curses me. I can’t lose you again!”

My gaze followed the ring. My non-existent body instinctively chased after it, trying to catch it outside the door. But I had no physical form.

I could only watch helplessly as the ring passed right through my hand, plunging directly into the street drain, instantly washed away by the sewage.

I’d always known Julian had no real affection for me, that he was only with me for the money I’d provided.

But seeing him toss that ring away with such utter indifference, my heart ached so intensely I could barely breathe.

I sank to the ground, powerless. The next second, my body was forcibly pulled back, closer to Julian, as I had drifted too far. 

I was then forced to witness Julian, overcome with emotion, leaning in to kiss Celeste.

“The chat records I want to restore today are also with you. Do you still have them on your phone?”
