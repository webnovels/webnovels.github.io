Before being taken into the operating room, I couldn't hold back and called my parents. 

The call only lasted three seconds, with Mom and Dad's anxious voices on the line: "Nora, we're about to board.

 Your sister's competition is important. Whatever it is, wait until we get back." 

I didn't even manage to say a word before the call was cut off. I stared at my phone screen, dazed. 

Just then, I saw a new post from my boyfriend Declan. He said he was off to chase his dreams, with a picture of a plane ticket showing the country where Daphne's competition was. 

I stared at the screen until Aunt couldn't stand it and took my phone away. "

Aunt has signed the consent form for you. 

Don't worry, whatever happens, Aunt will take care of it," she lovingly patted my head and sighed, "Brother has been foolish all these years, poor you... Go on, child, I'll be waiting for you outside."

 I was taken into the operating room as the anesthesia gradually took effect. 

Before losing consciousness, I couldn't help but wonder if I died in this surgery, would my parents shed a tear for me? And Declan, I thought, once I come out, I must tell him. 

I knew he had changed his heart long ago. This time, I decided I don't want him anymore.
