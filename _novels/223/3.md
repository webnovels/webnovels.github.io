The story of Declan and me wasn't very dramatic, but back in college, it was well-regarded among teachers and classmates. The story started typically.

 The student council president, who had a great family background and looks, helped an exhausted logistics member who fainted from low blood sugar at an orientation event.

 The second time we met, he had two candies in his pocket just for me. From then on, keeping candies in his pocket for me became Declan's habit. He saw me as fragile. 

He would always look at me worriedly and say, "Nora, I've never been so afraid of losing someone." He said I meant something different to him than anyone else. 

There was always a special place for me by his side. Just like he always had candies ready for me in his coat pocket.

 But the last time, after pulling two all-nighters for meetings, I reached into Declan's coat pocket.

 All I found was a strange lipstick, Chanel silver tube 116, Daphne's favorite shade.

 Silently, I put the lipstick back in his pocket and learned to carry my own candies from then on.
