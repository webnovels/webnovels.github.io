"I see, so we have such a deep connection."
Thinking about how someone had been reborn with me twice, it was quite an amazing feeling.
"Heh," the little snake laughed dryly, "I don't want this kind of connection."
"From now on, we'll have to fight side by side, you must protect me."
"I'll be lucky if I don't kill you."
I looked towards Lily in the distance, who was looking back and forth between the leopard-man and the merman.
"What do you think, who will she choose?"
"How would I know?"
"Then in your opinion, who is stronger?"
The weak snake body twisted in my hand, but his commentary was ruthless.
"They're both weak."
I didn't bother trying to get an answer from the little snake anymore and focused on Lily's situation.
But unexpectedly, she turned her head and looked at me.
"Cousin, who do you think I should choose?"
With these words, everyone in the scene fell silent, waiting for my answer.
Whether Lily followed my advice or not, the one who wasn't chosen would inevitably hate me to the bone.
She was using me to draw hatred.
I laughed coldly: "Why don't you take both, cousin?"
"These two beast-men are both so excellent, I'm sure you'd be willing to split your spirit power for them."
Actually, each member of our family could contract more than one beast-man.
But contracting a beast-man required occupying spirit power in the mind sea.
If one wanted to contract multiple beast-men, they would need to split off a new piece of spirit power from their original mind sea for each contract.
Spirit power was similar to mental energy. Even a tiny bit of damage would make one feel their soul trembling, extremely painful.
Not to mention forcibly splitting the originally whole spirit power into several pieces.
Sure enough, as soon as I finished speaking, Lily's face changed.
She forcibly suppressed the unwillingness on her face and smiled: "I was just joking. Actually, I've already made my choice."
She walked towards the taller and stronger leopard-man, cut her fingertip, and dripped blood onto his lowered forehead.
Silver light appeared, and the contract was formed.
The leopard-man looked smugly at the dissatisfied merman prince, then knelt on one knee the next second.
"I am Zack. I will protect you, forever and ever."
I sighed, couldn't help but think of the past.
He watched indifferently as I stood in front of him, single-handedly resisting the attacks of other beast-men.
At that time, he wasn't as devoted as he is now.
"What a stupid woman," the little snake said venomously. "If you couldn't beat them, why didn't you run?"
"And didn't you know he didn't care about you and couldn't wait for you to die?"
"How was I supposed to know then!" I angrily retorted. "And once we formed a contract, isn't it natural to trust your partner with your back?"
The little snake fell silent.
After a long while, he reluctantly spoke: "I'm called Kieran."
The contract ceremony was over, and I was about to leave. I wanted to explain to my mother why I didn't choose the beast-men she had prepared for me.
But things weren't over yet.
The merman's face was pale as he held Lily's hand, giving her a pleading look.
"You really don't want me?"
"I can use sound attacks, I can make people within a mile drop dead instantly."
"I can heal, as long as they're not dead, I can save them."
Kieran laughed lightly: "That's not all he's best at."
I asked him what the merman was best at, but he clammed up again.
But no matter how the merman begged, Lily still heartlessly let go of his hand.
"I already have Zack."
"But you can contract two beast-men!" the merman said urgently.
Lily shot me a hateful glance, blaming me for reminding the merman of this. How could she bear to go through the pain of splitting her spirit power?
She violently shook off the merman's hand, but still had to maintain her gentle and lovable image: "I'm sorry, I have enough with just Zack."
I was planning to make up a reason to explain to my mother why I didn't choose the beast-men she had prepared for me.
After all, rebirth wasn't something that could be explained clearly in a short time.
Not to mention being reborn twice.
But she said: "If there's something difficult to say, then you don't need to explain. No matter what, I believe in my daughter."
In two rebirths, the only constant was that my mother always believed in me like this.
I died inexplicably twice, I can't imagine how painful it was for her.
If only for my mother's sake, I had to become stronger.
Thinking of this, I looked firmly at Kieran.
"Now that we've contracted, the next step is to train together."
Kieran was still as venomous as ever: "You think I need to train with you?"
An incense stick later, he dragged his limp body and, under my coercion, said the words "I'm willing."
I bid farewell to my mother and took Kieran with me into the Trial Spirit Realm.
