The Trial Spirit Realm was created in ancient times, forming its own small space with many rare magical beasts and treasures.
I entered from the outer edges, starting by slaying the first magical beast, gradually moving inward.
From initially being chased by magical beasts, to later being able to fight back, and finally being able to take on ten at once.
Although Kieran was also busy improving his own cultivation, he didn't stay with me, going out early and returning late every day, coming and going alone.
But after two past lives, my bottom line for contracted beast-men had already dropped very low.
As long as he didn't kill me, it was fine if we weren't together.
Moreover, Kieran's power increase also greatly benefited me as his contractor.
Kieran transformed into human form in the third month. That night he came back earlier than usual.
Seeing him appear, I dismissed the magical beasts that were massaging my legs and back, and took out the spirit fruit I had specially picked for him.
"Come quickly, this Feather Spirit Fruit is most suitable for your snake clan to cultivate."
As I said this, I tried to stuff the Feather Spirit Fruit into his mouth.
But before my hand could reach his mouth, a strange scene suddenly appeared before my eyes.
A white mist spread out from nowhere.
A hand with distinct knuckles reached out from the mist and grabbed my wrist.
"Who told you I'm from the snake clan?"
It was still Kieran's magnetic voice.
The difference was that he was now in human form. Dressed in black robes, tall and handsome features.
He looked quite good-looking...
"Fine, if you don't want it, I'll eat it myself." I ignored the slight flutter in my heart and threw the Feather Spirit Fruit into my mouth.
But unexpectedly, Kieran intercepted it halfway and stuffed it into his own mouth.
What a fickle snake clan.
After that, Kieran changed his attitude and always followed behind me, even when I wanted to use the bathroom...
This was not good, because Kieran wouldn't help me fight against magical beasts together. Under his powerful pressure, no magical beasts would even come near me.
I helplessly protested to him.
He thought for a moment and agreed to my request.
After that, it became Kieran forcing a group of magical beasts to chase me, while I had to fight hard against a large group for self-preservation.
In the blink of an eye, half a year had passed. All the magical beasts in the Trial Spirit Realm had been beaten by me and now bowed to me as their master.
It was time to leave.
On the day we left, I saw my mother's figure at the entrance of the spirit realm from afar.
"Mother!" I ran over excitedly.
Mother looked me up and down, a smile of admiration on her lips: "Aria, you've improved a lot."
I leaned affectionately on my mother's shoulder: "Of course, I am mother's child after all."
The moment was peaceful, but suddenly an unpleasant voice sounded.
It was Lily.
"Cousin has indeed improved so quickly, you must have obtained many treasures in the Trial Spirit Realm."
Her eyes were evasive: "But cousin is the daughter of Aunt, the family leader, so these things are rightfully yours."
With Lily's words, the eyes of the family members who came to greet me changed.
As if my power increase was really due to my mother abusing her authority and giving me many benefits.
I shook my head: "It seems cousin really doesn't understand the Trial Spirit Realm."
"I stayed in the Trial Spirit Realm for half a year, creating the longest record in our family's history, yet you still think my power increase was due to external objects."
Lily was used to pretending to be weak and innocent. In the past, I had never embarrassed her in public.
Now her face looked very unpleasant, but I wasn't finished.
"Oh, I just remembered, cousin hasn't entered the Trial Spirit Realm for training yet, right?"
"Although our family has always had the rule of going for trials after completing the contract with a beast-man, you contracted your beast-man early, which was already an exception."
"Understandable."
Lily just wanted to say that I had a family leader as a mother and received preferential treatment.
But I wanted to tell everyone that she, Lily, was the one who was the exception again and again.
"Yeah, Lily has already contracted a beast-man, why hasn't she participated in the trials?"
Some dissatisfied peers began to speak loudly, "We all went through life and death to come out of the Trial Spirit Realm, why does she get to be so special?"
Lily also heard these words and became a bit guilty.
"My beast-man and I are of one heart and mind, we don't need to cultivate our rapport anymore."
As soon as these words came out, many people laughed.
"You don't think the trials are just to hone the rapport between you and your beast-man, do you? The trials are also a way to improve your strength!"
Just as Lily didn't know how to answer.
Suddenly a figure appeared in the distance, flashing past the blocking crowd in the blink of an eye, arriving at Lily's side.
This terrifying speed made most people present exclaim in admiration.
This was Zack, Lily's leopard-man.
He held Lily tightly in his arms, raising his head slightly: "Do you think my strength is not enough, and Lily needs to suffer extra hardships?"
No one spoke, all acknowledging Zack's strength.
"Lily's special treatment is backed by me."
Zack made such a statement, then left with Lily in his arms.
Before leaving, he glanced in our direction.
But he seemed to not notice Kieran behind me at all, only looking at me.
A sinister glance, full of warning.
