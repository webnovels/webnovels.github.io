I frowned imperceptibly.
It seemed that no matter what, Zack was very hostile towards me.
I still couldn't let my guard down.
Soon came the day of the family's grand competition.
According to family rules, every young member who had a contracted beast-man needed to participate in the family's grand competition.
The winner would receive rewards of top-grade magical tools and pills.
They could also exchange this opportunity to obtain magical tools and pills for a wish. If it wasn't too excessive, the family elders would allow and help fulfill it.
Lily came specially to tell me that she was also going to participate in this competition.
"Cousin, I drew you as my opponent. But my beast-man is very powerful, you don't mind, do you?"
"I do mind."
Two lives ago, I was called away by Zack on the eve of the competition, and encountered a group of out-of-control beast-men on the way back.
After I died, Zack dealt with these beast-men and offered the crystals from their bodies to Lily.
Lily's cultivation increased greatly because of this, and she became the winner of the competition.
And the wish she made was to receive Zack, this beast-man who had lost his contracted master.
With the help of the elders and magical tools, Lily didn't suffer any pain from splitting her spirit power, and got two beast-men.
And my soul was completely scattered, reborn into my last life...
Not expecting me to actually answer that I minded, Lily's face froze.
"Cousin, winning this competition, I have something very important to do. So, I must participate."
I smiled faintly: "Then why are you asking why?"
"I..." Lily stammered until Zack came and held her in his arms.
"Aria Frost." He narrowed his eyes at me, "If you had been a little nicer to Lily, I might have considered letting you lose gracefully."
"But with you treating her like this, I have no choice."
At this time, Kieran silently exerted his pressure beside me. Zack was caught off guard and instantly fell to his knees.
"Someone as weak as you," Kieran slowly walked in front of Zack and squatted down: "Tell me specifically, how were you planning to make her lose?"
Zack used all his strength but still couldn't break free from Kieran's pressure.
In the end, it was Lily who actively apologized to me before Kieran let them go.
As they left, their conversation clearly reached Kieran's and my ears.
"Lily, I'm sorry..."
"No, Zack, you didn't do anything wrong. It's my fault, I'm too weak."
"Lily, I will definitely protect you, I will!"
From that day on, Lily and Zack never appeared in front of me again.
Until the day of the family competition.
Lily stood opposite me, but showed no panic at all.
I took the initiative to attack, and Lily was injured after just a few moves.
Now it was time for our respective beast-men to take the stage.
"Aria Frost, I hate that arrogant look of yours the most. Just because you have a family leader as a mother, what's there to be so proud of."
Lily smiled strangely: "Everything you possess, from today onwards, will be taken by me."
As soon as I saw Zack appear, I roughly understood what was going on.
Zack had taken a forbidden drug.
