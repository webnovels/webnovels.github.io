I'm a foster daughter of the Johnson family. During the time when Gideon was temporarily blind due to a car accident, we had an unplanned night together. I ended up having a child with him, but following his family's arrangements, I left the baby with the Johnsons and moved abroad. Gideon became a single father without even knowing who his child's mother was.

Five years later, I returned to the country and married him. People say I must be open-minded to take on the role of a stepmother at such a young age. But what they don't know, not even Gideon, is that I am the biological mother of his son, Finn.
