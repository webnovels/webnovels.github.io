sets of disposable underwear

When we got home, we found the soundproofing already underway.

 Perhaps because my mom paid generously, there were eight or nine technicians in our thousand-square-foot apartment. 

When no one was paying attention, I asked my mom where she put the supplies.

"On the rooftop."

This was an unspoken agreement among the complex residents: the rooftop always belonged to the top floor. 

When I bought this apartment, I had visited the rooftop. Because the building was so tall, the rooftop railing was a good five feet, three inches high, and this building was the tallest in the vicinity. 

If you bent down, you wouldn't be seen from below. Luckily, I had my parents; I honestly hadn't thought about soundproofing or anything like that.

With money paid, the work naturally sped up. 

It was finished by around 8 PM. After seeing off the installation technicians, our family moved everything from the rooftop to the attic, and then brought up the rest of the supplies from the truck.

"We still need to buy some medicine. And some multivitamins. Water isn't enough either. Here, Avery, tomorrow you and your dad go buy water. Visit several stores, buying a little from each. I'll go buy seeds and soil tomorrow. I'm just worried no pharmacy will dare sell antibiotics because of the health advisory."

I paused for a moment. Medicine might actually not be an issue. I rushed into the room and brought out two large medicine chests.

 "Oh, Mom, you forgot! You and Dad always bring me so many medicines when you visit, and they're all recently dated. The last time was about ten days ago…"

Seeing the two overflowing medicine chests, our family finally felt relieved. "Even though your dad and I don't have high blood pressure or anything, it's always good to have some just in case."

My dad and I were busy moving supplies from the rooftop. We were truly exhausted today. My mom just boiled some noodles for a quick dinner. The next morning, we just had some milk powder and bread before heading out again.

**4.**
Six days left.

"Dad! Don't forget the solar panels and the large chest freezers. The freezers can go in the study. There should be enough space for two large ones."

No sooner said than done, we headed straight to the mall to buy two large chest freezers. Good thing it was cold now, otherwise the meat we bought yesterday would have spoiled.

We also bought several sets of solar power systems. No particular reason, just in case one broke. My dad said he could fix them, but what if?

While buying the solar systems, we also popped into the neighboring store and bought several thick blackout curtains.

There was still space left in the cargo van, so I took my dad straight to buy water:
