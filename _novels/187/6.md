At the hospital, the doctor used cotton swabs to carefully press down the blistered areas while asking Nathan with concern why he was so severely burned yet had no family accompanying him.

Nathan inhaled sharply from the pain. Two other doctors passed by the doorway, chatting.

"Miss Sullivan really dotes on her husband. Just a few small blisters and she booked the entire floor, getting all the dermatology specialists to consult."

"I know, right? Those few blisters would have mostly healed on their own if he'd come in a bit later. If only I could find a caring woman like that who loved me."

"Haha, dream on. Women like that only come along once in a blue moon."

Once in a blue moon?

Nathan smiled bitterly.

Abandoning her severely injured husband to go take care of someone with minor injuries - she truly was a one-in-a-million good woman.

Nathan's injuries were too severe. He needed to stay in the hospital for a few days.

Three days later, Nathan was finally discharged, his body still wrapped in bandages.

As soon as he turned on his phone, countless missed calls and messages popped up, filling the screen.

They were all from Olivia.

This had never happened since Ethan's return.

While Nathan was still in a daze, Sophie called. As soon as he answered, her shrill voice came through.

"Nathan, you've got some nerve! Where have you been for three days? Did you do it on purpose?! Can't compete with Ethan so you're pulling this kind of stunt? Do you know my sister's been going crazy looking for you?! Don't think this will get her attention. Dream on! The position of Sullivan son-in-law will always belong to Ethan!"

After finishing her tirade, Sophie hung up.

Nathan just furrowed his brow.

Had he heard wrong?

Olivia had been frantically searching for him? How was that possible? Wasn't she busy taking care of Ethan? Why would she look for him?

But when Nathan looked at the 999 missed calls on his phone, it did seem to show Olivia's urgency in trying to reach him.

Filled with confusion, Nathan returned home.

As soon as he entered the gate, the servants rushed over looking immensely relieved. Several of them were on the verge of tears as they spoke.

"Sir, you're finally back. The young miss has been going crazy looking for you..."

Just then, the sound of hurried footsteps approached.

"Nathan!"

Olivia anxiously ran over. In the three days apart, the usually glamorous woman looked rather haggard, especially the dark circles under her eyes.

"I was in the hospital. The same one where you were taking care of Ethan."

Hearing this, Olivia sighed. "About last time, I didn't mean to abandon you. It's just that after Ethan's surgery, the doctors said he needed to stay calm and not get agitated, or something could happen. I've been used to taking care of him since we were kids, so that's why I took him to the hospital first."

"And you didn't object at the time either. Since you were at the hospital, why didn't you tell me or answer my calls? You're my husband. Don't you know I'd be worried? Can you not do this again next time?"

By the end, there was a hint of accusation in her tone.

But Nathan just looked at her calmly, not responding.

Because in two more days, he would be gone.

So there wouldn't be a next time.

For some reason, seeing Nathan's calmness, Olivia suddenly felt panicked as she recalled Nathan's behavior these past few days.

She stepped forward and took Nathan's hand, sighing, "Actually, Ethan really didn't mean to hurt you last time. Since you don't want him staying here, I've already had him move out. Can you stop being upset over this little thing from now on?"

Olivia stared directly at Nathan, hoping to see a trace of being moved in his eyes.

But Nathan had no reaction. He removed Olivia's hand and turned to go upstairs.

As soon as he entered the room, he saw an expensive watch placed on the bed.

He looked up questioningly at Olivia who had followed behind.

Olivia sighed. "Nathan, this is my way of making it up to you. You won't be angry anymore now, right?"

Nathan looked at the watch in the box, worth millions, a complex look flashing in his eyes.

Three years. A full three years.

They had shared a bed, had happy times together.

In her eyes, was he really the type of person to fake being angry and hurt just for compensation?

Suddenly, he recalled the gifts Olivia had carefully prepared for Ethan in her social media posts. A mocking feeling welled up, but he quickly suppressed it.

Forget it. If she didn't understand, there was no point in explaining.

Seeing no smile appear on Nathan's face, Olivia didn't think much of it, just assuming he didn't like it.

"Nathan, if you don't like these, once I'm done dealing with Ethan's situation, I'll take you to an auction to pick out the most expensive one for you..."

Olivia hadn't finished speaking when Sophie and Ethan's voices came from outside the door.

"Ethan, I told you my sister loves you so much, she'd never really make you move out. It's all that Nathan's fault. I'll scold him for you later. You'll move back in, right?"

As they spoke, the two brazenly walked into Nathan and Olivia's bedroom.

Then upon seeing the watch set on the bed, Sophie exclaimed in delight: "Oh my god, sis! Ethan just mentioned to me that he really liked these watch models. I can't believe you actually bought them!"

She looked at Ethan beside her, her eyes full of envy.

Hearing this, Ethan's face instantly reddened, then he shot a smug look at Nathan.

Seeing that Olivia didn't immediately deny it, but instead looked hesitant, Nathan didn't even think before picking up the box and handing it to Ethan.

"If it's meant for you, then take it."

With one sentence, he made the choice for Olivia, resolving her dilemma.

At this moment, Olivia looked at Nathan in shock. Seeing how generous he was being, the unease in Olivia's heart grew stronger. She wanted to object, but seeing how happy Ethan looked, she closed her mouth.

She thought to herself, it's fine, next week is our wedding anniversary.

She could make it up to Nathan then.

Surely she was overthinking things. He was just jealous and sulking. Nathan loved Olivia so much.

How could he possibly leave?
