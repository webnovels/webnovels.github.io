"Watch out!"

Seeing the hot soup flying towards him, Nathan instinctively pulled Olivia into his arms to protect her.

Then he watched helplessly as a huge pot of scalding chicken broth poured all over him.

"Ahh!"

In an instant, Nathan was drenched in soup, his skin immediately turning bright red from the burns. The searing pain nearly made him pass out.

"Nathan!"

Olivia pushed Nathan away, her eyes full of panic. "Don't be afraid, I'll take you to the hospital right away!"

He looked up at her, the pain spreading through his whole body. He used all his strength but couldn't say a word.

Then he looked at Ethan.

"I'm so sorry, Mr. Xu. Are you alright? Olivia, thank goodness Mr. Xu protected you."

Seeing Ethan's fake panic and the satisfaction hidden in his eyes, Nathan immediately realized what had happened and said shakily:

"You did that on purpose?"

Hearing this, Ethan was stunned for a moment, then tears started falling from the grown man's eyes. "Mr. Xu, what are you saying? How could I do that on purpose? I know you feel insecure and prejudiced against me. It's my fault for making you get burned!"

"But you can't slander me like this."

Seeing Ethan cry, Sophie resolutely stepped in front of him and angrily said:

"Nathan! That's enough! So what if you got a little burn? Why are you making such a big deal out of it? Ethan worked hard to cook for us, he's tired enough already! Besides..."

Sophie looked at Olivia, whose eyes were now filled with doubt and anger, and raised her chin to continue, "Besides, my sister was right there. Even if Ethan wanted to hurt someone, he'd never hurt my sister, right?"

As soon as she finished speaking, the doubt in Olivia's eyes instantly disappeared. She looked at Nathan with furrowed brows and said disappointedly,

"That's right, Nathan. Ethan wouldn't hurt anyone, least of all me. Please don't overthink things, okay?"

Hearing these words, Nathan felt countless emotions rushing to his head, tears welling up in his eyes.

Olivia sighed, her voice becoming calm. "Nathan, let's go to the hospital, alright?"

Nathan knew that no matter what else he said, Olivia wouldn't believe him now.

He was about to nod when-

"Oh no, Ethan, you're hurt so badly!" Sophie cried out.

Olivia's attention immediately shifted. She rushed over to Ethan in a panic. His snow-white arm had some small blisters, looking quite "severe" indeed.

Ethan put his arm behind his back, shaking his head with red-rimmed eyes.

"I'm fine. Mr. Xu looks much worse. You should take him to the hospital first."

He had barely finished speaking when Olivia turned back towards Nathan. Ethan immediately put on an agonized expression.

"Ah! Olivia! My heart hurts so much. It must be the shock of Mr. Xu accusing me just now. Ah, Olivia..."

Ethan collapsed, grabbing Olivia's hand as she tried to support him. He gasped weakly, "Olivia, am I dying? Will I never see you again?"

Sophie stomped her foot anxiously. "Sis! Ethan's heart condition is bad. Let's get him to the hospital quickly!"

"I-I'm fine..." Ethan continued gasping pitifully.

But this act undoubtedly made Olivia's heart ache. She could no longer think about the disheveled Nathan. She helped Ethan up and headed for the door.

Just before leaving, she seemed to remember something and turned back to Nathan with a guilty look.

"Ethan's heart is weak. I'm afraid something might happen to him. The hospital isn't far from here."

"...Nathan, you can take a taxi to the hospital yourself."

It wasn't until their three figures had disappeared from view that Nathan came back to his senses, inhaling sharply through clenched teeth as he fought against the pain.

Seeing how severely he was injured yet left behind, the servants quickly ran over with painkillers and alcohol.

But Nathan's burns were too severe. Even after taking the painkillers, he still had to lean against the wall for support, enduring the pain as he slowly made his way towards the hospital.

With each step, he moved further and further away from the place he had called "home."
