After returning from the orphanage, Nathan went to the civil affairs bureau and learned that in five more days he could finalize the divorce. Only then did he go home to pack his luggage.

It was then that he realized his clothes filled several entire closets.

Inside were also various expensive watches, sports car keys, and other priceless gifts from Olivia.

In truth, during their three years of marriage, Olivia had always been good to him, constantly giving him black credit cards, houses, cars, and more.

But he had never touched any of it.

Because every time Olivia gave him gifts, Nathan would see the shadow of someone else in her reddened eyes.

To be precise, Olivia's kindness to him was all stolen from Ethan, who had temporarily exited the stage.

He used to think that with time, Olivia would see his true heart. But reality proved that what didn't belong to him would eventually have to be returned.

Nathan sorted out some of his own belongings, then took all the gifts he had given Olivia over the years and sold them for scrap.

Over the years, to make her happy, he had carefully prepared many gifts for her. She had never even glanced at them.

The only watch she ever wore was quickly replaced by a cheap bracelet from Ethan after he returned.

Seeing all these gifts tossed aside with a thick layer of dust on them, Nathan smiled bitterly again. If Olivia truly loved him, where did all this dust come from?

Watching the junk truck drive away, he was about to return to the villa when he heard a horn honk behind him.

Nathan turned to see a flashy Ferrari stop in front of him.

A girl in a red dress stepped out of the car with a showy air. It was his sister-in-law Sophie.

Sophie frowned at the departing junk truck, then snorted disdainfully.

"As expected of an orphan with no parents. Even cardboard boxes have to be sold for money. Acting like our Sullivan family is going bankrupt or something."

Nathan didn't even look at her, turning to leave.

Sophie's mocking smile turned to anger. She stepped forward to grab him.

"Nathan!"

Ever since Nathan had entered their Sullivan family, he had always been very humble and tried to please everyone. He had never given her the cold shoulder like this before.

Today he actually dared to turn his back on her. A fire of rage instantly rose in Sophie's heart.

"Hey orphan! Are you deaf? I'm talking to you!"

Nathan turned back and pulled off her hand, his eyes flashing with annoyance.

Sophie had always disliked him, feeling that someone of his background was completely unworthy of entering their prestigious Sullivan family.

So for three years after the wedding, she had constantly targeted him, saying things like the breakfast he made wasn't fully cooked, or stepping on the clothes he had washed to dirty them.

But now that he was leaving, he didn't want to tolerate her anymore.

Sophie was about to continue making a scene, but seemed to think of something. The corners of her mouth curved up into a sneer.

"Someone like you should sell more junk. After all, now that my sister's true love Ethan is back, you can get lost, you so-called stand-in."

As she finished speaking, a man in a white suit, dressed quite elegantly, stepped out from behind her.

This was Nathan's first time seeing Ethan in person.

A pair of almond-shaped eyes brimming with charm, messy black hair casually swept back, porcelain white skin paired with the fitted white suit - just standing there exuded an aura of nobility.

No wonder Olivia had been so obsessed with him for all these years.

But that suit, those accessories -

Nathan found them somewhat familiar. Wasn't this style of dress exactly the same as what was in his own closet?

In that moment, Nathan fully understood. He really had just been a stand-in all along.

Ethan looked Nathan up and down, as if seeing a cheap version of himself, full of disdain and mockery.

But this expression was quickly hidden away when Olivia's car pulled in behind them.

He immediately put on a pitiful face and said, "Sophie, don't talk about Mr. Xu like that. He's your brother-in-law now. What if he gets angry and kicks me out?"

Just as he finished speaking, Olivia's panicked voice came from behind.

"What's going on? Who's kicking who out?!"
