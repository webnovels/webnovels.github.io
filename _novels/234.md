"I was a freak. Always had been. From the time I was a little kid, I could see dead people.

My old man? He thought I was full of it. Called me a liar to my face.

Mom was the only one who believed me, who tried to soothe my nerves.

But then Dad croaked, and… nothing. No ghostly Dad hovering around, no spectral lectures.

I told Mom, and she got this weird look on her face, like a lightbulb had just gone off in her head.

She ignored Grandma’s screaming about a traditional burial, and insisted on having him cremated. It wasn’t until after the flames that I finally saw him."
