"I've transferred this month's money to you," I said casually, lounging on the sofa and addressing Sophia's back. She was bent over, feeding the gecko in its terrarium.

After a while, she slowly straightened up and turned to me with a smile. "Yes, I've received it."

Her voice was as gentle and warm as ever, matching her overall demeanor.

I paused, then spoke again: "Oh, there's something I need to tell you. I have to fly to Jiuzhaigou for a few days tomorrow. Work's been stressful lately, and the team's been clamoring for a change of scenery to relax, so..."

"In that case, why don't you stay a few extra days? Do you need me to pack for you?" she asked, standing at a comfortable distance.

A faint smile played on her lips.

"No need. There are, uh, some spare clothes at the office," I replied.

She nodded, then added as an afterthought: "The temperature varies a lot in the mountains. Remember to bring a jacket, or you might end up sick in the hospital again."

As she said this, her expression was serious and sincere, clearly genuinely concerned about my health.

I couldn't help but sigh inwardly.

Sophia was a gentle soul. That was everyone's unanimous impression of her, including mine. Throughout our marriage, she had been exemplary, truly deserving of the title "virtuous wife and loving mother."

She devoted herself to raising and nurturing our daughter Chloe;
For me, she was endlessly accommodating and attentive.

Last year, when I was hospitalized with pneumonia after getting caught in the rain, she was constantly bustling about, making me nourishing soups and seeking out traditional remedies. The doctor said it would normally take a month to recover, but I was better in just two weeks.

Still not satisfied, she repeatedly confirmed with the doctor:
"Are you sure he's fully recovered? Can he go back to work now?"

Only after receiving the doctor's assurance did she seem to let out a long-held breath.

I knew with absolute certainty.

Sophia loved me.

Apart from our daughter, I was her whole world.
Any small matter concerning me became the center of her universe; a minor illness or pain was enough to consume her entirely...

I really shouldn't have been leaving at this time.
In two days, it would be the death anniversary of her parents.

They had died in a car accident, and following their wishes, their ashes were scattered in the mountains. The annual memorial trip required a grueling four to five-hour hike.

In fact, Sophia and I first met during one of my hiking trips, when I encountered her making the solitary journey to pay respects to her parents.

It wasn't safe for a woman alone in the wilderness, so after we got together, I made it a point to accompany her every year without fail.

But.

Zoe had been in a mood lately.
I had promised to take her to Jiuzhaigou to cheer her up.
