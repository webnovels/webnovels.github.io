My chief assistant, Marcus, wiped the cold sweat from his brow, his face a picture of deference.

"Madam, I'll call The Onyx Club’s owner right away and have him give you an explanation."

I let out a cold laugh.

"No need. Have our people cordon off this entire club. Not a single soul leaves this place!"

Marcus bowed, accepting my order, and retreated.

Dare to touch my sister? Then you won't leave here alive!

Lily's pale face was streaked with tears.

"Last night, it was just you and me! How could other men be in the room?"

Tiffany Vance snuggled closer into Julian Thorne’s embrace, covering her mouth as she giggled.

"Oh, Lily, you're such a joker. Julian was with me all of last night. How could he have been with you? Looks like you needed a thrill for your first time, Julian alone wasn't enough, so you invited a whole party, huh?"

Lily froze, muttering, "No way… The room key was given to me by Julian himself. We even had a candlelight dinner last night…"

Mid-sentence, Lily suddenly looked up, staring intently at Julian, trembling with rage.

"It was you? You drugged me, then you called them…"

Julian merely raised an eyebrow, ignoring her. Then, a short video clip flashed on the large screen – Lily lying on a bed, barely clothed!

Julian Thorne smirked, pulling a USB drive from his pocket and tossing it onto the table.

"Alright, alright! For those who bet correctly on who took Lily's virginity last night, you'll also get a full video of the entire night!"

All the men in the club instantly stared at the screen like hungry wolves, their eyes gleaming with lechery.

"Even just this short clip is incredible! I can't imagine how amazing the full video must be!"

"High-class girls are just different. Her screams sound better than any other woman's!"

I watched the video on the big screen, shaking with fury.

When Julian Thorne and my sister got engaged, the Thorne family was nothing compared to the Hayes. If Lily hadn't liked him, my parents would never have agreed.

But now, where did Julian Thorne get the audacity to treat my sister like this?

I grimaced and sent a message to Marcus, instructing him to investigate everything.

At that moment, the men in the club pulled out stacks of bills, slamming them onto the tables, yelling like rabid dogs as they placed their bets. Lily huddled in the corner, her eyes numbly watching it all.

"Everyone placed their bets?"

Julian Thorne leaned lazily on the sofa, stifling a yawn.

"We have, but how are we going to figure out who took Ms. Hayes' virginity last night?" Manager Davies, who had just finished tallying the bets on stage, asked with a confused frown.

Julian Thorne chuckled.

"How long ago was last night? There must still be traces inside her. We just need a doctor to check, right?"

With that, he clapped his hands.

"Bring them in!"

A few medics in white coats approached the stage, immediately seizing Lily and moving to strip off her pants.

The men in the club craned their necks, eagerly anticipating the depraved show.

Terrified, Lily snatched a pair of forceps from one of the medics' hands, pointing them and screaming,

"Don't come closer! Do you know who I am?! Dare to touch me, and you'll all be dead today!"

Lily looked serious, but to everyone else, it was just a pathetic struggle.

Tiffany Vance led the laughter.

"Oh, you still think you're the high-and-mighty heiress of the Hayes family?"

Tiffany stepped forward, pinching Lily's face. Her slender nails dug into Lily’s delicate skin, causing faint streaks of blood to appear.

"Your Hayes family's power is long gone! Besides, this club is my brother, Victor Sterling's territory. Here, you're nothing."

Victor Sterling?

Victor Sterling was my father's trusted subordinate. If this club was truly his, would he dare to let my sister be humiliated here?

And when did my Hayes family ever decline?

Julian Thorne wrapped his arm around Tiffany Vance’s waist, soothing her gently.

"Why argue with her about this? The priority is to find out who got to her first last night."

Then, he looked at the medics, his eyes sharp.

"What are you waiting for? Get to it!"

The medics pressed Lily onto the stage again, pulling down her outer pants. Just as they were about to pull down her underwear, the manager suddenly gasped in alarm.

"Wait!"
