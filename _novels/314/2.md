Everyone froze, and the medics stopped their actions.

Manager Davies quickly stepped forward, his hands trembling as he picked up a black card that had fallen from Lily's pocket. Cold sweat immediately beaded on his forehead.

"Is this… a Centurion Black Card?!"

At his words, the entire club erupted in a clamor.

"What? A Centurion Black Card?"

"Only a handful of people in the country own this card! I heard she's incredibly powerful and mysterious, capable of ruining a family with a snap of her fingers. How did it end up in Lily Hayes' hands?!"

Julian Thorne's pupils contracted slightly as he stared at the black card, his face instantly darkening.

Manager Davies, his forehead glistening with cold sweat, hurriedly dialed the club's top floor.

"Mr. Sterling, I have a guest here with a Centurion Black Card. I request your presence."

Not long after, a woman descended from the top floor.

I recognized her – Jessica, Victor Sterling’s secretary.

"Mr. Sterling is held up with some matters, so he sent me down to greet this esteemed guest."

Jessica wore a polite smile. She was about to take the black card from Manager Davies when Tiffany Vance interrupted her.

"If I'd known this card was so important, I would have pulled mine out earlier."

Tiffany Vance pulled a black card from her bag, holding it between two fingers and waving it in front of Jessica.

The moment everyone saw the black card in Tiffany Vance's hand, they were shocked.

Tiffany Vance also held a Centurion Black Card!

"I'm the Centurion Black Card holder! How could she possibly have one? It's probably a fake!"

Tiffany Vance looked at Lily with disdain.

Jessica stepped forward and took Tiffany Vance's card. After examining it for a moment, her eyes held a hint of fawning as she looked at Tiffany Vance.

"Ms. Vance's black card is real!"

Then, she looked at Lily, her eyes full of contempt.

"Ms. Hayes, not just anyone can have a black card. You shouldn't try to pass off a fake one, even if you're trying to show off."

Lily shook her head, her voice frantic.

"Impossible! This card was given to me by my sister; it can't be fake!"

"My sister is Seraphina Hayes!"

Tiffany Vance scoffed.

"Seraphina Hayes? Which prominent figure in this city don't I know? I've never heard that name before."

Jessica crossed her arms, standing aside as if enjoying the show.

"Since Ms. Vance is this club's most esteemed guest, Ms. Hayes' matter has nothing to do with Mr. Sterling. You may continue."

The quiet crowd instantly erupted into a roar again.

"Hurry up and check! I bet millions!"

"I'm adding another half a million! It's definitely me!"

The medics surrounded Lily again, their hands reaching for the last line of defense protecting her privacy.

Marcus hadn't returned yet, and I couldn't wait any longer.

"Stop right there!"

I furiously stood up from the booth, striding quickly to Lily's side. Taking advantage of the medics' momentary愣神 hesitation, I pulled Lily off the stage and helped her put her clothes back on.

Tiffany Vance stared at me in shock, her eyes full of fury.

"Who are you?! Do you know the consequences of causing trouble on Mr. Sterling's turf?!"

I shielded Lily behind me, my lips parting coldly.

"Seraphina Hayes, the eldest daughter of the Hayes family."
