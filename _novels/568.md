My wife's assistant linked a bizarre system to me.

Every time I got angry, his bank account would rake in massive amounts of money, directly proportional to my fury.

He'd deliberately flirt with my wife, infuriating me so much I had a heart attack in the middle of the night and ended up in the hospital.

Meanwhile, his bank account had three million dollars wired in, and he was so thrilled he posted three SnapChat stories.

After I was revived, I confronted my wife, but she just sneered at me with contempt:

"Oh, so Kyle's account gets more money the angrier you get? Why don't you admit he's just working hard to achieve all this?"

"If you had even half of Kyle's drive, you wouldn't still be just a project manager."

Later, when he was short ten million to acquire my wife's company, he deliberately sent me a hotel room number.

He wanted me to walk in on them, trigger another heart attack, and die on the spot.

But when I woke up, I was back on the day I first saw Kyle with Charlotte.

The familiar ache in my chest was exactly as I remembered.

This time, I just made them hold each other even tighter:

"You two are made for each other. Seriously, just lock it down."
