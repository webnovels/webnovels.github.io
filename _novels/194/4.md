When I woke up in the hospital, a nurse told me I was pregnant for a month but had a miscarriage due to excessive drinking, leaving my body weak. Hearing this, I touched my empty abdomen in a daze. 

I never expected this to happen to me, and before I could even feel the presence of this little life, it was gone because of my carelessness. 

In my grief and despair, it was Ethan who held my hand tightly and said, “Nora, this is all my fault. Blame me if you must. We will have another child in the future. Please don’t let this drag you down; everyone is waiting for you to recover!” 

At that time, with Ethan’s comfort and my parents’ patience, I gradually emerged from the gloom and returned to working hard.

 But deep down, I never forgot the child who didn’t get a chance to see the world.

That business deal earned us our first fortune, and Ethan’s company officially got on track. Once everything stabilized and no longer needed my help, I retreated to the background. 

To better care for Ethan and support his career without worries, I became a full-time housewife.

 I thought Ethan appreciated my efforts and wouldn’t fail me, but in just a few short years, he forgot his vows and sought a mistress behind my back.
