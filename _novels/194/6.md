Adeline’s words froze me in place. I never expected Ethan to say such things behind my back and secretly have a child.

 After becoming a housewife, I considered having a child, but despite all my preparations, I never got pregnant. With no other options, I went to the hospital for a check-up. 

That’s when I found out the previous miscarriage had caused irreversible damage to my body, and I might never become a mother. 

Hearing the doctor’s words, I left the hospital in a daze, barely remembering how I got home. 

I only remember when I opened the door and looked in the mirror, my face was covered in tears. When I tearfully told Ethan about the results, he was momentarily stunned before replying immediately.


Later, with no other options left, I went to the hospital for a check-up. It was only then that I found out the previous miscarriage had caused irreversible damage to my body, meaning I might never become a mother.

Listening to the doctor, I was in such a daze that I don't even remember leaving the hospital. I only recall that when I opened my front door and looked in the mirror, my face was already streaked with tears.

When I tearfully shared the test results with Ethan, he was momentarily stunned but quickly responded, “Honey, children don’t define us. Even if we never have kids, what’s there to fear? 

As long as we love each other and walk through life hand in hand, that’s the happiness I want most.”

Back then, hearing Ethan’s response, I couldn’t help but hold him tightly, feeling grateful I hadn’t chosen the wrong person. 

I silently vowed to take even better care of him in the future.

Little did I know that all of this was just a dream Ethan had woven for me. 

While I placed all my trust in him and was lost in this false happiness, he already had a child of his own.

Thinking about how foolishly I’d been played all these years, every sacrifice I made for Ethan felt like a slap to my face. 

At that moment, the doctor’s urgent voice rang in my ears again, “Family member, the situation is extremely critical now. 

Please decide quickly who we should save first.”

Looking at Ethan’s eyes, filled with the desire to live, and recalling what he had done to me, I painfully closed my eyes and finally made my decision. 

I understood better than anyone that once trust is broken, it can never be restored.

 The moment Ethan chose to betray me, our marriage had reached its end, with no chance of reconciliation.

I could only thank the heavens for allowing me to discover the truth now. I couldn’t bear to imagine my fate if I waited until that illegitimate child grew up while I aged.

 Would Ethan kick me out? Would Adeline humiliate me? Or would I die realizing I was just a pawn in someone else’s game?

With these thoughts, I clenched my fists in anger. Everyone must pay the price for their choices, and now it was time for Ethan to face the consequences.

With that thought, I didn’t hesitate any longer. After casting him a cold glance, I decisively turned to the doctor and made my final choice.

“Doctor, I’m Ethan’s wife. I’ve decided to stop his resuscitation. As for that woman, I don’t know her.”

Hearing this, Ethan began to scream like a madman, “Nora, you can’t do this! You can’t just give up on my life. I want to live, I want to live!”

“Nora, I’m begging you, please, have mercy and save me. I don’t want to die now…”

Facing Ethan's desperate pleas, I felt indifferent.

 All I could think was, if he had foreseen this outcome, why didn't he act differently back then?
