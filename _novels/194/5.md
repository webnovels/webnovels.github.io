When I thought about how I felt sorry for Ethan’s busy work life and made nourishing soups for him, while he used business trips as an excuse to see his mistress, I couldn’t help but feel hatred. 

Just as I wanted to question Ethan about his conscience, the doctor interrupted me, “Are you one of the patients’ family members? 

Since they’re both impaled by the same steel rod, we can’t operate on both simultaneously. We need to separate them quickly, so you need to decide who to save first.”

 Hearing the doctor’s words, before I could respond, Ethan’s painful wails reached my ears. “Honey, I beg you, save me first.

 I know I was wrong, but I promise I won’t see Adeline again. I’ll make it up to you for all the harm I’ve caused.” Listening to Ethan’s firm promises, I couldn’t help but laugh mockingly.

 If I hadn’t believed his nonsense, I wouldn’t have been fooled for so long. How could I believe him now? 

Before I could mock Ethan, Adeline, covered in blood beside him, suddenly shouted.

 “Ethan, you heartless man! You told me Nora was just a barren hen, and that thanks to me risking my life, you have a son. But now, to save yourself, you say such things? Don’t you want us or our son anymore?”
