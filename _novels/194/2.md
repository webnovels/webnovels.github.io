When I finally reached the hospital, I couldn't even wait for the car to come to a full stop. I flung open the door and stumbled inside.

 Gasping for breath in the emergency room, the first sight I saw was Ethan lying on a hospital bed, covered in blood with tubes everywhere. 

Seeing him like that broke my heart, and I began to cry.

 Just as I was about to check on Ethan and reassure him that I was there for him, I suddenly noticed a young woman lying behind him.

 What puzzled me further was that both Ethan and this woman were impaled by the same steel rod in their abdomens, lying in a strange position on the same bed. 

I couldn't comprehend why Ethan would be with this woman in the middle of the night or how they both ended up in this accident. 

As I stood there, confused and unsure how to face the situation, the police officer pulled me aside.

 After confirming my identity, he explained the whole story: Ethan had violated traffic laws by kissing a woman named Adeline in the car and neglected to watch the traffic lights, leading to the collision with the truck and this tragic outcome. 

The officer showed me the surveillance footage, and as I watched Ethan and Adeline kissing, my heart felt as though it shattered into pieces.
