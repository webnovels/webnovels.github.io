My father ordered my older sister, Valerie, and me to choose our fiancés from the Thorne family's twin brothers.

In my previous life, Valerie chose the healthier younger brother, Brandon Thorne, leaving me with the disabled, quiet, and introverted Julian Thorne.

I didn’t want him to die in the future, so I accepted my fate.

He walked with a limp, so I took him to top specialists nationwide.

He couldn't protect me, so I learned self-defense to get strong, begging my father not to send him away.

I thought he was just physically disabled and emotionally withdrawn.

I believed if I was patient enough, he'd eventually open up to me.

Until the day the mansion caught fire, with thick smoke billowing everywhere.

He spoke to me for the first time, his voice clear and icy:

"I'm sorry, but Valerie is still inside."

He let go of me, turning and rushing back into the flames.

I was trapped under a fallen beam, watching his retreating back as he jumped from the second-story window carrying Valerie. The last thing I heard was his hoarse voice:

"I failed you in this life. I promise to make it right in the next."

I realized then that his disability and silence had been only for me.

When I opened my eyes again, I was back on the day we chose our fiancés.

This time, I'd choose the ruthless man who controlled half the city's underworld.
