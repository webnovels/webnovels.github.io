Mrs. Cooper learned that I stood up for Jasper, and she was very grateful.

With the current fierce competition for inheritance and Jasper's uncertain recovery, she couldn't help but frown.

Seeing her looking so gloomy, I told her some mischievous stories from my childhood to cheer her up.

She smiled slightly, then looked at me with regret: "What a pity."

Jasper always wanted to sneak out to play, but Mrs. Cooper wouldn't allow it.

I followed him all the way and saw him go into the playground in the community, constantly clamoring to play on the swings.

Those nannies, who usually tremble at the mention of his name, were all snickering with their heads down.

Mrs. Cooper was grateful when she found out I stood up for Jasper. 

But with the ongoing fierce fight over the family inheritance and Jasper's uncertain recovery, she couldn't help but worry.

 Seeing her so downcast, I shared some playful stories from my childhood to lift her spirits.

 She smiled slightly but soon looked at me with regret, saying, "What a pity."

Jasper always wanted to sneak out and play, but Mrs. Cooper never allowed it. I followed him to the community playground, where he insisted on playing on the swings. 

The nannies, who usually trembled at the mention of his name, were all hiding their laughter. I held the swing steady for him to get on.

 "If the young master wants to play, then play! Quinn will watch over you!"

Jasper happily sat on the swing and gestured for me to come closer with a playful air. Curious, I leaned in, and he took a candy from his pocket and placed it in my hand.

 "Quinn, I hope your days are always as sweet as this candy." His words made my heart skip a beat, and I instinctively looked away. Feeling a bit awkward, I pushed him on the swing. "Quinn, about that night, can we do it again someday?"

My hands froze, and I glanced around to ensure we were alone, then sighed in relief. Blushing, I gently patted his head. "Young master, that's our little secret.

 You mustn't speak of it or tell anyone else." Seeing my serious expression, he nodded solemnly. "I understand, Quinn! It's our secret! Jasper is great at keeping secrets!"

 I couldn't help but laugh at his earnestness.

Time passed quickly, and three months flew by. Jasper's condition hadn't improved; it worsened. Initially, he just wanted to play with the kids in the neighboring community.

 Eventually, he ran away and disappeared. 

Remembering my words, he declared himself the master of the house when the nanny tried to stop him. No one could hold him back.

When Mrs. Cooper found out, she was furious and no longer gentle. 

She had me held down, kneeling in Jasper's room. In the eyes of these wealthy people, we never had any dignity. "You can get up when Jasper returns."

 It wasn't until midnight that Jasper was found.

 He was discovered in a small room like a dog cage. The neighboring community was also wealthy, home to rich kids. They tricked Jasper into going with them, locked him up, and taunted him as an idiot.

Jasper's car accident had injured his brain, and the story of him wetting his pants while playing with kids spread throughout the villa area. 

After Jasper came back, Mrs. Cooper still didn't let me get up. First, because I failed to watch over Jasper, letting him run off. 

Second, she wanted me to recognize my place and do my duties. I knelt for nearly ten hours, my legs numb, and finally collapsed to the ground.

Jasper seemed to realize he was at fault. He looked at me kneeling in his room, bewildered. 

He went to plead with Mrs. Cooper to let me up, but she just gave me a cold look and turned away. 

Seeing he couldn't persuade her, Jasper strode over and knelt beside me. "I'm sorry, Quinn, I shouldn't have run off. It's all my fault, and if Mom wants to punish you, then I'll kneel with you!"

Mrs. Cooper couldn't bear seeing Jasper insist on kneeling beside me. "Get up, take good care of the young master, no next time." Mrs. Cooper looked down at me, and I bowed my head.

 "Yes, ma'am." After Mrs. Cooper left, I breathed a sigh of relief. Just as I was about to stand up, ignoring the pain in my knees, I staggered and almost fell again. Suddenly, Jasper caught me and lifted me up.

He gently placed me on his bed, rolling up my pant leg as I had done for him to apply medicine. My knee was swollen and red. "Quinn... I'm sorry."

 His eyes turned red, and he gently massaged my wound with his fingertips. "It's Jasper's fault. Quinn can punish me however you want; I'll do whatever you say." Seeing his guilty and helpless expression, my heart softened.

"Will the young master listen to everything Quinn says?" He nodded vigorously. "Yes, yes! Jasper always keeps his word!"

 "Then I punish you to eat well, sleep well, and take good care of yourself from now on!" Jasper paused, then suddenly hugged me. His head buried in my neck, he murmured, "Quinn, Jasper wants to grow up quickly." I gently patted his head, "Why does the young master suddenly want to grow up?"

"Mom said only when Jasper grows up can he truly be the master of the house." 

"Then I can protect Quinn and never let anyone bully you again!" My nose tingled; the young master was indeed naive. Why protect a nanny's daughter?

The news of Jasper's injury, which left him with the intelligence of a three-year-old, reached other members of the Cooper Family. 

Several illegitimate children began to stir. 

Mrs. Cooper was overwhelmed dealing with the strategies that came one after another and the company's affairs. Despite her previous efforts to seek out renowned doctors, there was no progress in healing Jasper's mind. 

Overwhelmed with anger and stress, she also fell ill and was hospitalized.

Jasper hadn't seen Mrs. Cooper all day and was getting anxious. "Quinn, have you seen Mom?" "Ma'am is still working overtime at the company! Be a good boy and go to sleep. 

You'll see her when you wake up tomorrow!" Before being hospitalized, Mrs. Cooper had specifically instructed not to let Jasper know about her hospitalization. I had no choice but to coax him to sleep.

Jasper pressed his lips together, staring at me expressionlessly. "Quinn, you're lying to me." "Mom didn't come back yesterday, and last night Mrs. 

Wang packed up Mom's clothes and took them away. Mom's favorite pearl earrings are still on the table. Quinn, tell me the truth!" 

Though he had the mind of a three-year-old, he was still sharp. Unable to hide it from him, I took him to the hospital to see Mrs. Cooper.

Mrs. Cooper was surprised to see Jasper. 

Jasper rushed into her arms, "Mom! Jasper will behave from now on, please don't get sick, okay?" Mrs. Cooper's hand trembled, but she eventually patted Jasper's back. Tears welled in her eyes, "Forget it, living an ordinary life is fine too."

Jasper eagerly volunteered to get hot water for Mrs. Cooper, and she smiled and agreed. After he ran out excitedly with the kettle, she indicated for me to follow him to ensure nothing happened. 

When I caught up to the place where water was fetched, I only saw Jasper lying on the ground and the kettle of hot water spilled. He had run too fast, slipped on the water, and fell.

When he woke up, he miraculously recovered. 

"The blood clot in the patient's brain has mostly dissipated; he can be discharged without any issues." Mrs. Cooper cried tears of joy upon hearing the doctor's words.

 Everyone gathered around Jasper and Mrs. Cooper, returning to the Cooper Family home. I stood alone in the empty hospital room, feeling momentarily lost.

Jasper had recovered, so what about me? After returning to the Cooper Family home, Jasper was furious. "Get everything replaced immediately! 

How did my room become such a mess? It's disgusting!" Any trace of my existence was quickly erased. Initially, I was thrilled to hear Jasper had recovered, but now I felt like I was plunged into an ice cave.

When Jasper looked at me, there was no longer any warmth in his eyes, only undisguised disdain. 

"Get out! Do any random stray cat or dog think they can enter my room?"
He returned to his usual aloof and commanding self.

"This is Adeline, Aunt Adeline's daughter. She took great care of you when you were injured. Why not have her stay with you a bit longer?"

It was only then that Mrs. Cooper seemed to remember my presence and tentatively explained to Jasper.
