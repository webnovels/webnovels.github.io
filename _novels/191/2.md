Under Mrs. Cooper's arrangement, I changed into a high-end nightgown I'd never worn before and was politely invited into Jasper's room.

Mrs. Cooper even arranged someone to watch outside the door.

I looked at Jasper lying in bed, hesitating.

It's too late to regret now.

The room's lighting was dim, and there was a pleasant-smelling incense burning, creating an extremely ambiguous atmosphere.

I didn't dare to look directly at him. Even now, though foolish, he still looked very good.

"Quinn, I'm so hot, I feel uncomfortable all over."

Jasper kicked off the blanket in a huff, looking restless.

I quickly stepped forward, pulling the blanket back over him.

"Young master, don't be naughty; you'll catch a cold."

Jasper curled up in the blanket, only revealing a pair of eyes blinking at me.

Somehow, I also started to feel hot.

It's the incense!

Mrs. Cooper must have drugged it.

The people outside, not hearing any movement inside, knocked on the door three times.

Jasper struggled to pull his hand out from the blanket and touched my forehead.

"Quinn, are you hot too? You're sweating!"

I steeled myself, grabbed his hand and kissed it.

The next day, the person Mrs. Cooper sent saw the marks on me and nodded in satisfaction.

I was exhausted and sore all over.

Jasper seemed to think it was a fun game, clinging to me all night, I don't know how many times we tangled.

Though Jasper is foolish now, his physique and stamina are truly remarkable.

Mrs. Cooper let me go home for a bit. Today was Mom's day off.

I usually make sure to have dinner ready and wait for her to come home so we can eat together.

After I managed to brush things off with Mom, I returned to the Cooper Family and saw Jasper's cousin, Finn.

"Cousin, this is the latest toy, it's really fun."

After saying that, he mockingly threw the toy to the floor.

Hearing "fun," Jasper eagerly crawled under the table to pick it up.

Finn grinned and kicked the toy further away.

As soon as I walked in, I saw Jasper crawling on the floor like a puppy, trying to fetch it.

"Young master!"

Seeing Jasper, who used to be decisive and ruthless, now in such a state, I inexplicably felt a twinge in my nose.

My appearance made both of them stop what they were doing.

Jasper beamed, "Quinn! Cousin got me a new toy!"

I rushed over and picked up the toy from the floor.

"Young master, remember, you are the master of this house. You can order the nanny to do anything; you don't need to do it yourself."

Finn looked displeased: "Who are you? Why are you meddling in my bonding time with my cousin?"

"I'm Jasper's assistant."

He laughed out loud after hearing that.

"Yeah, he does need a personal assistant; he probably can't even dress himself now."

After saying that, he glanced at Jasper sitting on the floor, looking smug.

"Cousin, I'll come to see you again once I'm done with the company's matters."

After he left, Jasper's eyes turned red, and he tugged at my pant leg, looking pitiful.

"Quinn, it hurts."

His knee seemed to have been bruised earlier, with a bit of skin scraped off.

I resignedly rummaged through the medicine cabinet, carefully applying ointment to his wound.

"Quinn, you're so nice! You're just like Mom, the best to Chenny!"

Hearing this, my hand paused.

"Young master, no one loves you more than Mrs. Cooper, and in this world, no one will be good to you for no reason."

"A gentle knife always has ulterior motives."
