"What, you're pregnant?"

Asher turned his head in disbelief, frowning slightly with irritation.

"Didn't I give you birth control pills? How could you still get pregnant?"

Asher grabbed my chin, his gaze deep and probing.

"How could this be? Didn't Asher always stay in Cora's room?"

"Who knows what tricks Adeline used; now she and Cora are both pregnant. Guess who the Chen family will choose."

"Who knows, but it's definitely not me."

"Isn't it obvious? Just look at how Asher favors Cora. Adeline is just a sycophant."

A few beautiful, tall women gathered, discussing with envy and jealousy. They were all Asher's lovers and contenders for the position of the Chen family's mistress.

Grandma Chen once said whoever gives birth to a son first will be Asher’s wife. In my previous life, I tried everything for this title but never won his affection. I ended up switching the birth control pills to get pregnant.

I never expected Asher to torment me to the point of wishing for death for Cora, and now standing in this scene again, I just want to escape, away from this sickening place.

"I don't know."

I turned my head impatiently, breaking free from his grip.

"How can you not know, you shameless woman! You just want to have my child? You don't even care about your dignity for the mistress position!"

Asher insulted me angrily, his eyes full of disdain.

"This is my child, none of your concern."

I said coldly, my gaze sharp.

"Stop pretending to be high and mighty! Shameless thing! Go to the hospital and abort this child now!"

With that, Asher forcefully dragged me outside.

"Nonsense!"

Mrs. Chen suddenly came downstairs, tapping the floor hard with her cane.

"Since Adeline is already pregnant, this child is of Chen blood, and your wedding can be arranged."

Mrs. Chen and my grandmother were very close friends. After my parents died in a car accident, she took me in and cared for me, always intending for me to be her granddaughter-in-law.

"Grandma!" Asher protested unwillingly, "Didn't you say whoever gets pregnant first will be my wife? Cora is also pregnant, did you forget?"

"Grandma."

Before Mrs. Chen could speak, I quickly interjected, "Cora got pregnant a month before me, so logically, she should be the mistress of the Chen family."

Asher and everyone else looked at me in surprise, not expecting the usually eager-to-marry-him follower to willingly give him up.

"Stop pretending to be innocent! You just want to gain Grandma's sympathy, you scheming woman. I will never marry you!"

Asher glanced at me disdainfully, pulling the silent Cora close.

"Grandma, Cora is my first love, my only true love in this life. Please fulfill your promise and let me marry her."

"There's no need to discuss this further. Adeline is from a reputable family, far more suitable than someone who can't be presentable."

Mrs. Chen spoke with underlying meaning, clearly looking down on Cora.

"Grandma, are you going back on your word?" Asher asked in a low voice, challenging Mrs. Chen's authority, which was incredibly foolish. I wisely stayed silent.

"Forget it, Asher."

Cora moved slightly in his arms, looking down pitifully.

"If Grandma doesn't like me, just let me go. I hope you and Adeline have a happy life."

"Don't worry, Cora. If I can't marry you, I would rather die alone!"

Asher swore sincerely, his emotional display making me sick.

Cora's eyes brightened, casting a triumphant glance at me.

"You ungrateful thing!"

Mrs. Chen was furious, but Asher didn't even glance at her, his mind full of Cora.

"Grandma, don't be angry. Although Adeline and I are both pregnant, it's still uncertain if it's a boy or a girl. Asher is just afraid of marrying a sister who might give birth to a girl."

My body went cold, remembering how my unborn child was beaten to death in my past life, the bloody scene making my stomach churn. I covered my mouth, dry heaving.

"Stop pretending to be pitiful!"

Asher glared at me viciously, then looked at Mrs. Chen.

"I think Cora is right. It's uncertain if they are boys or girls, and there's the question of a safe birth. It's too early to discuss a wedding date."

Asher's dangerous gaze filled me with fear, and my lower abdomen ached faintly.

"Besides, it's uncertain if this child is even of Chen blood."

"Cora!"

I reflexively shouted in anger. In my past life, my poor child was killed because of Cora’s deceit. I clenched my fist tightly.

"Are you trying to disgrace the Chen family with your words?"

"Sister Adeline, don't misunderstand. I'm just thinking of Asher. Everyone knows you have a childhood friend studying abroad. Who knows if you've been in contact?"

Cora spoke with a slow, deliberate tone, her eyes shifting.

The childhood friend she mentioned was Jasper, my mother's classmate's son, who went abroad for college. We grew up together, but I always had a crush on Asher, so I had little contact with him.

In my past life, Cora framed me with Jasper similarly. Seeing the scene about to repeat, this time I didn't avoid it.

I chuckled, responding confidently, "Sister, if you say it's for the Chen family, I'm willing to take a paternity test to prove my innocence."

Cora didn't expect my calmness, nervously clenching her fists.

"Adeline, if I find out your child isn't mine, you're done for. I'll make sure you suffer!"

Asher sneered, threatening me. He had said this countless times in my past life, and I was already numb to it.

"Since Cora is also considering the Chen family’s best interest, for fairness, let's have her tested too, so everyone can be at ease."

"Why should I!" Cora was the first to speak, pouting, "I've only ever been with Asher. Do you think everyone is like you?"

I smiled mockingly at her. Of course, she wouldn't agree because she was the one involved with someone else! She switched the paternity test in the past, leading to my cruel fate.

"Why are you panicking? Do you have a guilty conscience?"

I pressed on, scaring Cora into clinging to Asher's arms.

"Asher." She called out weakly.

"Enough! The child in Cora's belly is certainly mine. She would never be as shameless as you!"

"The shameless one is you!" Mrs. Chen scolded, "Since both children concern the Chen family bloodline, let's follow Adeline's suggestion and have both tested."

"Grandma!"

Asher wanted to protest, but Mrs. Chen waved her hand, cutting him off.

Cora stood behind Asher, looking at me with venomous eyes.

The next day, Cora and I went to the hospital to have the paternity tests signed.

To prevent any repeat of past tragedies, I kept a close watch on her to ensure she couldn't switch the reports again.

"You think I don't know what you're up to?"

Cora sneered, "If you know my child has issues, why not expose me?"

"Because you're afraid Asher won't believe you. You're really deep." Cora's face twisted, abandoning her sweet facade.

"I'm aware of your tricks. You want to harm my child, but it's not going to happen."

I crossed my arms, planning to leave once her deceit was exposed. I no longer loved Asher, so there's no need to stay.

"You're wrong."

While I was lost in thought, Cora suddenly began to laugh wickedly.

"Do you think I stayed in the Chen family with only one trick?"

With that, she deliberately fell backward down the stairs.

"Asher! Save me! My baby!"

Suddenly, blood spread beneath her.
