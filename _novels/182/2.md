I was stunned. Though such a clumsy method often appeared on TV, I didn't expect her to be so ruthless, disregarding her own body.

"You're crazy!"

I shouted, panicking.

"So what if this child isn't of Chen blood? Now it's gone because of you, dead with no proof. Guess who Asher will blame first?"

She laughed triumphantly, then clutched her belly, weeping loudly.

"It hurts! It hurts! My baby!"

Everyone in the hospital gathered to watch, and Asher rushed through the crowd, lifting Cora’s frail body.

Suddenly, blood spread beneath her.

2.

I was stunned. I've seen such clumsy tricks on TV all the time, but I never imagined she'd be so ruthless, disregarding her own body.

"Are you out of your mind?!"

I shouted, feeling utterly helpless.

"Even if this child isn't from the Chen family, what does it matter? Now that he's gone because of you, there's no evidence left. Who do you think Asher will blame first?"

She laughed triumphantly before clutching her stomach and crying out.

"It hurts! It hurts! My baby!"

The entire hospital staff gathered around to watch the commotion. Asher anxiously pushed through the crowd, cradling Cora's weakened body.

"Cora, hang in there. The doctor is on the way."

"My baby... my baby."

Cora's voice was choked with sobs, tears streaming down her face, while the blood beneath her continued to spread.

"Adeline!"

At that moment, Asher despised me, shouting hoarsely, "I'm going to kill you! You killed my child with Cora, you malicious woman!"

"I didn't!" I was shocked but immediately defended myself, "She fell on her own; it has nothing to do with me. If you don't believe me, we can check the security cameras!"

I looked up, hoping to find footage, only to realize we were in a camera blind spot.

No wonder Cora spoke to me here. She feared the child's parentage would be exposed, so she planned everything in advance.

"You’re still denying it in the face of danger!" Asher picked up Cora. "If anything happens to Cora, I'll make you pay with your life!"

With a vicious threat, he hurried to the emergency room with her in his arms.

"Miss Cora's body suffered severe trauma. It will be difficult for her to conceive again."

The doctor shook his head in regret, while Asher held the tearful Cora, his expression filled with pain.

"It's okay, Cora. Even if we don't have children, I will only marry you. This is what the Chen family owes you."

"Asher..." Cora softly leaned against his shoulder, occasionally glancing at me.

"Don't blame my sister. I'm sure she didn't mean it."

Only then did Asher remember I was still there. He immediately stood up and rushed over, grabbing my throat.

"Adeline, you deserve to die! You killed my child with Cora. I'll make you pay!"

His grip tightened, making it hard for me to breathe, and my vision began to blur.

"How do you know... the child is yours?"

Using the last of my strength, I spoke. Asher let go, and I fell to the floor, gasping for air.

"Sis Adeline!" Cora cried stubbornly, tears in her eyes, "I know you hate me, hate that I took Asher away, but you can't insult my child like this! He's already gone, and you still won't let him rest?"

"Adeline, you're asking for it!" Asher clapped his hands, and several strong bodyguards came in.

"Hold her down and beat her hard."

I widened my eyes in disbelief, shouting anxiously, "I'm carrying your child! How can you do this to me!"

"Who knows if your child is part of the Chen family? Besides, you killed Cora's child, so yours will pay for it!"

I struggled in panic. Though I avoided the paternity test, I still couldn't protect this child!

I cried out, "This is your child! Let him go, please!"

"If I let him go, who will let my child with Cora go? A child born of such a vicious woman is just as worthless!"

Asher's cruel words pierced my heart like a stake, leaving me pale with pain.

"How can you treat me like this? What did I ever do to you? You've already killed me once, isn't that enough?"

In desperation, I screamed, clutching my belly.

"What nonsense are you talking about!" Asher frowned impatiently, stuffing several pieces of paper into my mouth.

"You're too noisy, disturbing Cora's rest."

He gave me one last cold look, then ordered the bodyguards to act.

I whimpered in pain, but the paper in my mouth choked me, preventing any cries for help.

Just like in my past life, the thick stick fell brutally onto my body. My lower abdomen throbbed with a tearing pain, and a warm flow beneath me—blood, I knew it was.

"Mr. Chen, the report is out."

The secretary rushed into the hospital room, her pupils shrinking when she saw me lying weak on the floor.

Despite the intense pain, I lifted my head, thinking I was finally saved.

But the next second, Asher tore the report into pieces.

"So what if it's my child? She killed Cora's child, so she must pay!"
