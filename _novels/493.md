When I was seven, I got lost in the mountains with my parents and was raised by a community living wild in the mountains.

At fifteen, my parents found me.

But I couldn't fit into human society. It was my twin sister who patiently guided me.

When my wild side flared up, hurting people and getting me ostracized,

She shielded me with her frail body, took a beating so bad she coughed up blood, and was left with a chronic illness from that day on.

For her, I pushed myself to study, got into a top university, and joined a special department thanks to my ability to communicate with animals.

At twenty-three,

My sister excitedly told me,

"Sis, I really love him."

"He took 99 lashes for me; we're going to be so happy."

But less than a month later,

I received a video from my parents.

My sister, covered in wounds, her face a pulpy mess, lay in a coffin, her severed limbs beside her.

In that moment, my long-suppressed wildness exploded.

All I wanted was to find the person who killed my sister and rip them to shreds!
