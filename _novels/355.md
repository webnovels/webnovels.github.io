I fell in love with Lucas Gray, the heir to our company's biggest rival.
We were fierce competitors in the boardroom, and just as passionate in the bedroom.
Our trysts left traces in his office, his car, the shower, the balcony - everywhere we could steal a moment together.
My birthday was coming up in a week. I decided I would officially announce our relationship at my birthday party.
But then I overheard him talking with his friends by accident.
"Damn, three condoms? Lucas, you animal. I thought you said this was just for fun? No need to put in so much effort."
"Man, imagine how that old Sinclair geezer would react if he knew his precious daughter was getting it on all over Lucas' office. Think he'd have a heart attack when he sees the video?"
"You're not going to chicken out of releasing the video, are you bro?"
Lucas exhaled a cloud of smoke, pausing before he slowly replied.
"Don't worry, I'm just playing with her. You know Emma's my fiancée. I'm only with Olivia to humiliate the Sinclair family. That bitch had the nerve to steal my deal - she deserves this."
I clutched the contract in my hand - the $100 million deal I had spent over a month convincing my father to agree to as our first partnership with Gray Corp.
Well, it seems the Grays don't need the Sinclairs' goodwill after all.
I dialed Ethan Morgan's number. "I have a business proposition for you. And if you're interested, I have a marriage proposal as well."
