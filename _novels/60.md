Asher's grandmother left a wish before she passed, hoping Asher would marry me. So even though he fell in love with his Thea, Asher insisted on marrying me. It wasn't until Thea killed the puppy I had raised since childhood that Asher chose to protect Thea again. This time, I didn't argue. Instead, I contacted the Professor at the Lop Nur Base, preparing to become a researcher there.

Before I left, I gave myself seven days to wrap things up. On the first day, I took off the engagement ring symbolizing "the only one." On the third day, I submitted my resignation at the company. On the day I was leaving, Asher suddenly remembered the puppy and promised to accompany me to buy a new one tomorrow. Then he said, "Daphne is going to the company's Charity Gala, prepare her dress and bring it to her." I agreed with a smile and disappeared from his world forever.

Later, whenever Asher heard about me, he would stare at our engagement ring in a daze. That was the lover he couldn't win back and the puppy he couldn't replace...
