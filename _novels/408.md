Queen Aethelred, famed across kingdoms for her breathtaking beauty, chose *me* of all people to be her Consort Queen.

 Every time I returned in my armor from battle, she’d look at me with utter disdain, "Why aren't you dead yet?"

Then, after eight years, I found myself clinging to life by a thread. She glared at the woman holding me, her eyes filled with chilling malice. 

"You're abandoning me for *this* beast-kin?" she fumed, her voice dripping with fury.

Yup, because a younger woman is just incredibly enchanting.

On the day of Queen Aethelred's ascension, dignitaries arrived from every corner of the realm. 

Royalty from neighboring kingdoms flocked, eager to witness her famed beauty.

As her newly crowned Consort Queen, I had barely finished my coronation ceremony before she dispatched me to the front lines that very night. 

My wedding night was spent alone, in a cold war tent.

But at that moment, I regretted nothing. Marrying the woman I adored while also fulfilling my family's legacy? It felt like winning the grandest lottery.

With a fierce surge of strength, I dominated the battlefield, returning victorious soon after.

The entire court roared, "Long live the Queen! All hail the Consort Queen!"

Queen Aethelred merely scoffed, casting a contemptuous glance at me, still kneeling in the grand hall. 

"That scar on your neck is hideous," she sneered, then turned and swept into her private chambers, leaving me to the buzzing whispers of the court.

She wanted beauty, didn't she? Back in my royal apartments, I diligently followed the royal physician's orders, taking elixirs and applying salves every single day.

"My Queen, look."

I eagerly showed Queen Aethelred my neck, now bearing only a faint line.

"Ugly people always make a scene," Queen Aethelred said, without even a glance. With a dismissive wave of her hand, she sent me back to the battlefield.

That perfect profile uttered such a callous remark. I pouted, but still donned my armor to expand her kingdom's borders.

With the Consort Queen herself on the front lines, and the granddaughter of the famed Thorne family, a founding pillar of the kingdom, morale soared. Victory reports poured in.

On the day of my triumphant return to the capital, the palace walls were adorned with festive lights and banners. 

Daisy, my personal attendant, was even more excited than I was. "My Lady, look! The Queen still cares for you!"

Just as I thought I had finally warmed Queen Aethelred's heart of stone, I drew closer and realized – this wasn't a celebration of *my* triumph. This was Queen Aethelred taking a new bride.
