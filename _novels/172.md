When I was crushed by the panicked horse at the zoo, it dawned on me why Asher had brought me there—he wanted to kill me again!

This marked his 99th attempt to take my life.

Yet again, his plan would fail. I asked the system, "Is the villain's malice level about to max out?"

The system replied, "Yes, it's at 99%. Just one more incident, and you can release yourself from being the villain's little wife and choose a new identity."

"Available identities are: A. Villain's stepmother; B. Swap identities with the villain; C. Return to your own body as the corpse sister."
