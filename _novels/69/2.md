Apollo's claws scratched the floor noisily as I followed him into the study, discovering the safe door ajar.

The microchip backup card, supposed to be locked inside, lay on the ground with a blurred fingerprint on its edge.

I inserted it into the computer with trembling hands. The system immediately flashed a red warning: [Microchip data anomaly, last modified: yesterday 23:47].

He was supposed to be on a flight to Paris then.

A metallic taste churned in my stomach, and I forced it down.

A new email notification suddenly popped up, a compressed package from the private investigator.

After unpacking, the photos showed him with Nadia in the corridor of a private hospital. The date was the same afternoon I first fainted from stomach pain.

The electronic screen in the photo corner showed a 14:30 timestamp, piercing my eyes.

That day he claimed to be in a board meeting, yet he appeared at a private hospital fifteen kilometers away.

Apollo suddenly perked up his ears, growling towards downstairs.

The garage engine roared to life, earlier than expected by two whole days.

I quickly deleted the records, just as the study door opened.

"Why is it dark in here?"

His voice was cold.

The scent of Edelweiss Perfume grew stronger as he approached. I pretended to tidy the desk, avoiding his reaching hand: "Project finished early?"

"Yeah."

He loosened his tie, a red mark faintly visible on his neck.

"You don't look well."

My nails dug into my palm as I suddenly burst into laughter: "Maybe it's the stomach acting up again."

His gaze swept over the computer, lingering on my tightly gripped right hand: "How's the lab lately?"

"Same as always."

I turned to the medicine cabinet, swallowing two stomach pills with my back to him.

"The phase three clinical data of the new drug looks promising."

The air hung still for a few seconds.

Apollo nestled at my feet, his tail brushing my ankle.

"There's a charity gala tomorrow," he suddenly said, "you don't have to go if you're not feeling well."

My grip on the medicine bottle tightened.

The detective had just informed me this morning that Nadia would be attending the gala as a special guest.

"Alright."

I heard myself agree obediently.

He visibly relaxed, bending down to pat Apollo, who evaded him.

The dog bared its teeth, a low growl rumbling in its throat.

"What's wrong with this beast lately?"

He frowned.

"Maybe it's in heat."

I crouched down, hugging Apollo, and discreetly slipped the microchip card into the collar's pocket.

"I'm taking it to the vet clinic tomorrow."

As he turned towards the bathroom, I caught a glimpse of the USB drive peeking from his suit's inner pocket—it was the encryption model from my lab.

The bathroom's glass door reflected his blurred figure. I gently stroked Apollo's ears: "Tomorrow, we'll buy a dress."

The dog looked up at me, its wet nose nudging my palm.
