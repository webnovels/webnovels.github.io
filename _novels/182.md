I was betrothed to Asher since childhood, but because he didn't love me, I became just another woman in his life.

Mrs. Chen said whoever gives birth to a son for the Chen family will be the future mistress.

In my previous life, because I loved Asher deeply, I swapped the birth control pills and got pregnant at the same time as his cherished first love.

She accused me of carrying a child that wasn't of Chen blood to secure her position!

Asher was furious and forcibly ended the life of my five-month-old unborn child!

"You treacherous woman! How dare you betray me? I'll make sure you can never have another child again!"

But the real traitor was his cherished first love!

Not only that, she staged a miscarriage and suicide to frame me!

"If my sister can't tolerate me, then I'll just die!"

"You vile woman, disgracing yourself and trying to harm Cora! I'll make your life a living hell!"

He forced me to swallow the ashes of my closest kin, removed my uterus in front of Cora's grave despite my cries, and left me to die in the wilderness.

In this life, I won't foolishly give my heart or let anyone trample on me.

Asher, I don't need your cheap affection.
