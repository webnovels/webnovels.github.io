On our wedding night, Ashton held me close and suddenly said:

"I’ve been having an affair. It's her birthday tonight, and I need to be with her."

My head started spinning.

"If you love someone else, why did you marry me?"

He got up and started getting dressed. My kiss marks were still visible on his neck.

"Nora, I love you. But we've been together too long. I need some excitement."

My throat tightened.

"So you're going to leave me on our wedding night to celebrate another woman's birthday?"

He pinched my cheek.

"You're already my wife. We'll have plenty of nights together in the future. Just let her have tonight."

"And if I don't?" I asked.

He smiled.

"Then we'll divorce. But you'll get nothing!"


Ashton sighed and stroked my hair.

"Remember the day you tried on your wedding dress? I was in the fitting room right next to yours, taking her virginity. She didn't dare make a sound, holding back her moans like a kitten. That kind of thrill is something you can't give me. Do you understand?"

All the blood in my body seemed to freeze, yet tears kept streaming down my face.

That day, I had been so happy trying on what I thought was the most beautiful wedding dress.

When I came out, I couldn't find him anywhere.

When I called, his voice sounded strained. He said he had an urgent business deal to handle.

I thought he was just in a bad mood, so I stupidly tried to comfort him, telling him not to work too hard.

Ashton caught my tears, his voice gentle:

"Actually, I didn't want to miss a single second of you in that wedding dress, but that little temptress was too clingy. I didn't get out of bed all day."

I stared blankly at the ceiling for so long I forgot to blink.

Ashton clicked his tongue and lifted my hand to kiss it.

"I'm sorry, Nora. I know you're hurt. If you really want a divorce, I can give you a villa in the city center as compensation."

"But if you're willing to endure this for me, everything I have is yours. My heart too."

Today was supposed to be the happiest day of my life.

I married the man I'd been with for eight years. Dream wedding, million-dollar diamond ring—everything felt like a fantasy.

Just five minutes ago, we were making love, completely lost in each other.

Now I was crying like a fool, asking him:

"Why did you tell me? Why tonight of all nights?"

Ashton wiped my tears over and over, his eyes almost tender:

"Silly girl, because I care about you. I know I'm terrible, but now that we're married, I should be honest with you."

He paused, then suddenly smiled:

"Of course, there's another reason. I've been dying to see your reaction when you found out the truth. Just like I imagined—so pitiful it makes me want to take care of you even more."

"So, let's not divorce, okay? I'll still love you like before, hmm?"

I slapped him hard across the face.

I grabbed everything within reach and threw it at him, screaming with all my strength:

"Get out! Get the hell out!"

Ashton tilted his head and wiped the corner of his mouth, standing up with a light laugh.

He straightened his collar and walked toward the door.

"Nora, calm down. I'm going to celebrate her birthday now."

The door closed softly.

I saw my reflection in my ring—like a person who'd lost their mind.
