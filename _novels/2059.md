On New Year’s Eve, while my mother-in-law was pressuring me to have a second child, my husband’s female assistant, Chloe, showed up uninvited, holding a baby.

"Aurora saved my life," Chloe announced dramatically. "I gave birth to the son you wanted for her! Can't you stop pressuring her now?"

She turned to me then, adding, "Better I stepped up than him running off with some random woman, right? Besides, I didn't want you going through childbirth pain!"

Every eye in the room turned to me—awkward, judgmental stares that burned into my skin.

In that sickening moment, it hit me like a slap to the face.

But she mistook my shock for blame, and her tears intensified.

"To make your marriage happy, he exploited me from the office to the bedroom. And you still blame me?"

Blake pulled the sobbing woman into his arms, comforting her. When he looked at me, his eyes were icy.

"Chloe's being so generous she'll even let you raise our son! How can you be this cold, Aurora? Can't you at least say thanks?"

I was hit with this overwhelming sense of absurdity. I stared at him, my heart turning to ice.

He probably didn't even remember.

Everything he had, everything he was—I gave that to him!
