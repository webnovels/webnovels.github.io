Seven years ago, during the first time Julian and I had a big fight,

I flew all night, crossing the Pacific Ocean to find him.

But in the furthest corner of a club booth,

I saw him passionately kissing a half-naked, delinquent-looking bar hostess.

That bar hostess was Seraphina Cross.

After I walked in on them, Julian, in front of hundreds of people in the club, knelt down and slapped himself repeatedly.

"I just came here to drink and relax…"

"I swear, it was just the alcohol between me and that bar hostess, it meant nothing!"

He kept slapping himself, blood oozing from the corner of his mouth, his cheeks red and horribly swollen.

My heart softened, and I forgave him.

Just when I thought it was an insignificant little incident,

three years ago, I saw Seraphina Cross again at Pei Corp’s exclusive club.

That bar hostess had become the general manager of the club.

I confronted Julian.

"Hiring is HR's responsibility, it has nothing to do with me."

"And besides, I heard she’s a single mom, and it’s not easy for her to make it here in the city with a child…"

I looked at his open, seemingly honest eyes,

and once again, I chose to forgive him.

Until now,

looking at the "family of three" in front of me,

I just felt like an incurable fool.

Seeing my silence, Seraphina’s eyes welled up with tears, looking utterly wronged.

"My son and I are all alone, Mr. Thorne was just being kind by helping us."

"You know, the kids at the kindergarten pick on Leo because he doesn't have a dad, so this parent-child sports event was so important to him."

"Don’t blame Mr. Thorne either, he didn't mean to not be with you. These past two days, he’s been with Leo practicing all night, he’s really tired."

Practicing all night?

I glanced at Julian, who looked visibly flustered, and couldn't help but laugh out loud.

"Julian Thorne, yesterday you didn't come home, and told me you were working overtime at the company?"

"The day before yesterday, you didn't come home, and told me a colleague was sick?"

"The day before that, you didn't come home, and told me you were on an urgent business trip?"

"Does it hurt to be slapped in the face like this?"

"So, you’ve been at Seraphina Cross's house all these days."

"Julian Thorne, how much of what you've said is true, and how much is lies?"

"Is this your biological son?"

Julian Thorne’s face changed instantly.

A flicker of guilt crossed his face, but he quickly forced himself to calm down.

"Scarlett, I know you're jealous about today, but you can't just make things up!"

"If you keep this up, I'll get angry."

Seraphina also looked regretful and helpless.

"I'm so sorry, Sister Scarlett. I talked too much. If you want to blame someone, blame me, not Mr. Thorne."

As she spoke, she shed tears of injustice.

"Seraphina."

Julian Thorne fumbled for a tissue to wipe her tears.

"It’s not your fault, Scarlett just overthinks everything."

His voice was so gentle, I’d never heard him speak to me that way.

I felt a chill spread from my feet throughout my entire body, a piercing cold to the bone.

Without another word, I turned and left.

And as soon as I got home, about to pack my bags,

I scrolled past Seraphina’s Ins post:

"They say a dad is his child's superhero. Today was another day where happiness became tangible!"

"Thank you, Daddy, for Leo’s championship gift!"

The accompanying photo showed Julian Thorne, Seraphina, and their son together.

The three of them were huddled close, looking perfectly harmonious.

I let out a bitter laugh, about to put my phone away,

"Ding—"

It was a SnapChat message from Julian Thorne.

"Scarlett, don't be mad. I bought a gift for the baby, I'll bring it back for you later."

I looked at the baby clothes in the photo.

It was the free gift that was in the corner of Seraphina’s picture.

I tightly hugged my sleeping child,

my vision blurred by tears.

I took a photo of the divorce papers Julian had signed,

and sent it to my best friend, Blake Miller.

The next second, my phone rang.

"Julian Thorne, that scumbag, did he bully you?!"

"Come back to Seaside City, don't be scared! I’ve got you and the baby covered, little lady!"

Over the years, because Julian was possessive,

I had practically cut off contact with all my friends,

especially my best friend, Blake Miller.

Hearing that familiar voice on the other end of the line, the tears I had held back for so long finally burst forth.

"Don't cry!"

"Give me seven days. I’ll get everything ready in Seaside City, then I’ll come pick you up!"

I agreed.

I also needed some time to sort everything out.
