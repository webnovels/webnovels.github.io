"Scarlett, what do you mean by this?!"

Julian Thorne, my husband, called out from behind me, his voice incredulous.

"I told you, I had an important company meeting today, that’s why I couldn't come with you to register the baby!"

"What are you throwing a fit about now?!"

I looked at the man in front of me, dressed head-to-toe in athletic wear, and couldn't help but want to laugh.

Wearing a tracksuit to a company meeting?

That lie was just pathetic!

What's more, that exact tracksuit Julian was wearing,

was identical to the matching family outfit Seraphina Cross had shared on her Ins stories that very morning.

"Julian Thorne, let's get a divorce!"

I tossed the freshly printed divorce papers onto the table in front of him.

Julian actually laughed.

"Divorce again? What number is this?!"

He picked up the divorce papers, not hesitating for a second, and dramatically scrawled his name.

"The 99th? The 999th? Or the 9,999th? Scarlett, can’t you come up with a new trick? I’m so bored of playing this game with you."

"We’ve been married for seven years, and now we have a baby. You can't live without me!"

Watching the triumphant smile on Julian's face,

a bitter pang twisted in my heart.

Yeah, seven years.

Everyone knew I loved Julian Thorne.

Even he was that confident.

But this time, I was truly ready to let go.

"No one is indispensable."

"And as for my child's father, he doesn't *have* to be you!"

My words made Julian’s face instantly darken.

He was about to argue,

when a little boy’s voice called out from nearby:

"Daddy Julian!"

Julian Thorne’s expression abruptly changed.

It was Seraphina Cross and her son.

"Julian, Leo insisted on bringing you the medal from the parent-child sports day himself, and… he said he wants to celebrate with you. If you’re busy, you don't have to…"

Seraphina put on an act of hesitation, as if she was troubled,

but her eyes held an unmistakable glimmer of expectation.

The little boy tugged on Julian's sleeve, pouting adorably.

"Daddy Julian, please, please come…"

Julian didn't respond,

instead, he looked at me with a guilty expression.

"Scarlett, you know… Leo doesn't have a dad, that’s why I…"

"I was just worried you’d get the wrong idea, that’s why…"

A mocking smile curled my lips.

If it had been before, if Julian had lied to me,

I would have thrown a huge tantrum, demanded answers, and pursued it to the very end.

But now, I was too tired to even bother.

"Didn't he ask you to celebrate? Go on."

I said blandly, turning to leave.

But Julian grabbed my arm.

"Don't overthink this, Leo just wants to share his joy with me."

Seraphina also spoke up.

"That's right, Scarlett, please don't misunderstand. Mr. Thorne just pities me."

On the surface, she looked innocent,

but deep in her eyes was a mix of provocation and smugness.

Exactly the same as the first time I met her seven years ago.
