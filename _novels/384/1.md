"Ava, weren't you madly in love with me? How can you refuse to do even this small thing for me?"

"You went to all this trouble to get pregnant with my child, just to force me to marry you and become the Ryan family matriarch you've always dreamed of, didn't you? Two years ago, when I had that car accident, you ran faster than anyone. And after I woke up, you shamelessly came back and tried to claim the cornea Chloe donated to me. Is there a single truthful word that comes out of your mouth?"

Ryan, seething with fury, hurled the pregnancy report at my face. I crumpled to the floor, powerless, passively enduring his baseless rage.

Chloe, seeing this, melted into his arms like a wilting flower, coaxing him, her eyes betraying a smug triumph when she looked at me.

"Oh, Ryan, Ava must have had her reasons for leaving you after the accident."

Chloe pretended to be blind as she fumbled to help me up from the floor, forcing a grateful smile.

"Actually, I should thank you, Ava. If you hadn't abandoned Ryan, how else would I have had the chance to come into his life?"

I scoffed, my gaze fixed on Chloe's bright, clear eyes.

"That year, was it *really* your cornea you donated to Ryan?"

Chloe shrank back into Ryan's embrace, startled and flustered, sobbing heartbrokenly.

"Ryan, is Ava still upset that I stole your affection by being with you? But after I lost my sight, you were the only person I could rely on. You've already been abandoned once; I don't want to leave you and make you experience the pain of being deserted by someone you love again."

Ryan fumbled to console the woman in his arms with soft words. When he turned back to me, his expression instantly shifted to one of disgust, and he yelled,

"Ava, haven't you caused enough trouble?! That year, you were afraid I'd hold you back from marrying into wealth, so you turned and left without a hint of hesitation. I was bleeding on the ground, begging you, but you were completely indifferent. If Chloe hadn't saved me, I probably wouldn't even be standing here now, looking at your accusatory glare."

Chloe snuggled into Ryan's arms, a sneer playing on her lips.

"Ryan, since Ava is so certain, maybe your cornea really *was* donated by her."

Ryan scoffed, "I might have been blind to the truth back then, but I'm not an idiot. If she really gave me her cornea, then how did she regain her sight? How can she now stand here so boldly, accusing you?"

A wave of bitterness washed over me. I clenched the bone ring on my finger, tears silently falling.

All these years, no matter how much I explained, Ryan always unconditionally believed Chloe, constantly mocking me and giving me the cold shoulder, as if I were his mortal enemy.

"Ava, I'm giving you a chance to make things right. You went to all this trouble to get pregnant with my child, didn't you? Well, I might as well put you to good use. Grandpa is on his last legs, and my older brother, who's been overseas for years, is coming back soon. I want you to seduce him, get into his bed, and then use the child in your belly to blackmail him into marrying you."

"Why? This is *our* child!"

I stared at Ryan's eyes, filled with longing, and spoke in disbelief.

"Ava, stop faking that sentimental look; it's disgusting. I told you, only Chloe is worthy of carrying my child. You're not."

"Grandpa despises disloyal men above all else. Asher is a married man. If you seduce him, pretend to be pregnant with his child, and blow the whole thing up, Grandpa will never let him become the heir to the Ryan family. Then, the entire family will be mine."

"After it's done, I'll allow you to give birth to this child and let you stay by my side to attend to my needs. But give up your foolish dreams. The position of Mrs. Ryan will only ever belong to Chloe."

Watching the couple's intense display of affection, I sneered.

"Fine, Ryan. As you wish."
