A sharp sting in my eyes made me understand. My mother had been quite old and suffering from many complications when she gave me her cornea, so the transplant had left me with lingering side effects. I needed monthly check-ups and treatment at the hospital.

Today was my scheduled appointment.

"Ms. Yu, our examination shows a risk of retinal detachment in your eyes. You need a new transplant as soon as possible."

I gently shook my head. If finding a new pair of corneas were that easy, then Ryan wouldn't have fallen for Chloe's deception all those years ago.

Seeing my indifferent expression, the doctor frowned, earnestly trying to persuade me.

"Ms. Yu, you can't take this surgery lightly. If you delay treatment, there's a risk of permanent blindness."

The doctor sighed heavily. "I'll start conservative treatment for now. Please go pay the fee."

Ten thousand dollars, a mere dinner bill for Ryan, became the last straw for me.

I returned to the Ryan family mansion. The moment I opened the door, I saw Ryan, his eyes sparkling with delight, gazing at Chloe, who was surrounded by towering piles of luxury goods.

I clenched my hands, lowering my head as I walked towards him.

Third Chapter

“Ryan, the doctor said there's a problem with my cornea. I need ten thousand dollars for treatment. Could you please…?”

“Enough!” Ryan impatiently cut me off. “Chloe was right. You're just a greedy, unscrupulous woman who'll stop at nothing to get what she wants. You're only with me for my money, aren't you?”

I opened my mouth numbly, feeling utterly speechless.

Chloe pouted, snuggling into Ryan’s arms and whimpering.

“Ryan, if Ava wants it, just give her ten thousand dollars. That amount isn't even enough to buy the cheapest bag I’m holding.”

“But, Ava, you shouldn’t just lie to get money. Today, I clearly saw you getting into a strange man’s luxury car. How could you have been going to the hospital?”

Chloe produced a blurry photo, a face barely discernible. Ryan’s anger instantly flared.

“Ava, have you ever told me a single truth? A money-hungry, unfaithful woman like you—if you weren't still somewhat useful, I’d be disgusted just looking at you.”

Ryan seemed to recall something, and he suddenly clamped his hand around my throat, staring intently at my slightly swollen belly.

“My child? Is that *my* baby in there?”

I incredulously raised my head, my voice cold as ice.

“Ryan, is that truly how you see me? As some kind of fickle, dishonest woman?”

I remembered that night. Ryan had burst into my room, reeking of alcohol, clutching my waist like a large dog, burying his head in my neck. A few hot tears had fallen onto my skin, searing my heart.

He’d held me tightly, pulling me into a deep, desperate embrace.

It wasn't until the heavy rain outside had finally stopped that he allowed me to catch my breath.

I had thought that night was the turning point in our relationship, a naive belief that we could go back to how things were, that we were still the only ones in each other's worlds.

But I never imagined that what I’d perceived as sweet, uncontrollable passion was just his drunken mistake. If it hadn’t been me, it would have been anyone else.

“Ava, since you want this money so badly, then open your eyes and watch me and Chloe make love.”

With that, he pulled Chloe closer and kissed her passionately. Ryan’s strong, bony hands roamed over Chloe’s body, stripping off her clothes in a few swift movements.

I watched their entwined bodies in the distance, listening numbly to the intimate gasps.

I don't know how long it lasted. As dawn broke, Ryan finally wiped his lips with a sated expression, then slammed a card down in front of me, his voice laced with venom.

“Ava, for money, you actually watched me make love to another woman right in front of you.”

“Take my money, then do what I tell you. You need to handle seducing Asher perfectly, or don't even think about staying by my side.”

I slowly picked up the bank card he had trampled under his foot. My heart felt like a gaping wound, a cold wind sweeping through, leaving behind an empty, hollow ache.

Ten thousand dollars. Enough to sever our past and all our grievances.

I had already repaid Ryan’s financial support with a pair of corneas. From now on, I owed him nothing.

I opened my phone and scheduled an abortion for tomorrow.

I gently stroked my slightly swollen belly. I had thought this child was the crystallization of Ryan's and my love. Now, it seemed it was anything but. I didn't want my child to come into this world burdened with stigma and humiliation.

Mrs. Jenkins, the housekeeper, her face filled with pity, helped me up from the cold floor and then went to the kitchen to make me a warm mug of tea.

“Ms. Ava, have some to warm yourself up.”

I hadn't cried when Chloe falsely accused me, nor when I endured Ryan's baseless accusations and humiliation. But at that moment, receiving a long-overdue act of kindness, I felt an overwhelming urge to cry.

Mrs. Jenkins sighed. “I’ve seen everything between you and the young master all these years. He has a sharp tongue, but a good heart. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have allowed you to stay by his side for so long.”

I gave a faint, bitter laugh and shook my head. “No, he has no heart. No matter how much I burn myself, I still can’t warm him.”

“I’ve decided to give up. To let him go, and to let myself go too.”
