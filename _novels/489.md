In my past life, I was Emily Foster, the substitute for Alexander Carter's idealized first love - cherished one moment, discarded the next.

Just because a new girl appeared who looked more like his first love, I was ruthlessly abandoned.

In the end, I was killed by his new flame.

When I opened my eyes again, I had been reborn as my suicidal twin sister.

It felt like jumping from one cage into another hell.

The good thing was, the substitute for his first love was gone, and now I had become the substitute.

Alexander Carter started acting like a clingy puppy that couldn't be shooed away.
