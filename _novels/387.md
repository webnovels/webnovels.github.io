Damien Thorne, the ruthless underworld kingpin, confessed his love for the ninety-ninth time. And for the ninety-ninth time, I rejected him.

That very night, he drugged me and held me captive.

Damien's eyes were wild, possessive. He held me close, whispering his love over and over, a chilling litany.

I scoffed, my heart burning with hatred for him.

I managed to escape, barely, only to be kidnapped by his enemies.

To save me, Damien took three bullets.

The first shot crippled his arm. The second blinded an eye. The third stole his life.

As he lay dying, covered in his own blood, Damien stared at me, his gaze stubborn, yet heartbreakingly fragile.

"Evelyn, why couldn't you just love me, just once?"

I opened my eyes again, and I was back. Back to the day Damien Thorne first confessed his love.

This time, I took his hand.

I thought we'd grow old together. But Damien, the man who died for me, betrayed me three times instead.

On our wedding night, he deliberately 'mistook' rooms and slept with someone else. I swallowed the bitter pain and forgave him.

Another time, a two AM call from someone else, and he left me stranded in the pouring rain in the middle of nowhere while I was three months pregnant. I miscarried. I wiped my tears, letting it go.

But the third time? He threw my elderly mother off a sheer cliff, hundreds of feet above the crashing ocean.
