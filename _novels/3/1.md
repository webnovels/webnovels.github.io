When I returned home, the room was dark.
I put down my bag, took off my shoes, and slowly felt my way along the wall.
The moment I touched the switch, a plate flew towards me.
I tilted my head and dodged it.
The lights came on.
The man standing on the stairs looked at me expressionlessly.
"So you remember to come back."
"..."
I smiled and walked towards him.
I reached out and hugged him.
"Can you stop acting like a resentful housewife, Lucas?"
He had a faint floral scent, the one I had chosen. I thought it might neutralize the coldness he emitted.
But it didn't. His eyes still looked at me with disgust.
