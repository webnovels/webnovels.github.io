In the eighth month of my pregnancy, I caught Lucas Reed cheating for the ninety-ninth time.

He tossed shredded lingerie in my face, his smile a mix of mockery and disdain.

"You're as appetizing as a dead fish in bed. How dare you accuse me of cheating?"

After a long silence, I calmly proposed divorce again.

Everyone around us groaned in exasperation, while Lucas raised an eyebrow and pulled out his phone.

"See? I told you she'd only suggest divorce. Pay up, ten grand each."

"Aria, if you're going to be a doormat, at least try a new tactic. Have some self-respect."

"Haha! She'll be begging to come back within two days, the ultimate pushover!"

Lucas smirked, silently agreeing with his friends' remarks.

But they didn't know I had already bought a one-way ticket to Germany.

Since Lucas had given all his affection to his mistress,

And harbored such deep hatred for me, his lawful wife,

I would set him free.

This time, divorce.

I meant it.
