This Assassin Thinks I Can't See Him, But He Always Undresses In Front of Me
He hears me swallowing repeatedly.
Assassin: "Are you hungry?"
I nod: "Mm-hmm."
He came back reeking of blood.
Although the scent was faint, I could still smell it.
The assassin took off his dirty clothes and headed towards the bathroom. "I'll make dinner after I shower."
I feigned shyness and asked coyly:
"Want to shower together?"
His body suddenly froze. He turned back to look at me.
I quickly added, "I can't see anything anyway."
"But I can!" he snapped, then turned and entered the bathroom.
