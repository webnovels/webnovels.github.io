As I was preparing to get a speedboat to leave the island, Ethan came to find me.

"There's a big shipment coming to the island the day after tomorrow. Send some men to receive it personally, and clear out your house. I need it!"

He commanded sternly, but I just found it laughable.

To marry Lily, he really didn't care about my life. Even if Xavier attacked his base, he still wanted me to risk my life to bring back his little flower. He was truly lovesick.

Need the house? Wasn't it just for Lily to live in?

I coldly replied with an "Oh."

Seeing my flat reaction, Ethan frowned in displeasure.

"What are you sulking about now? I'm not making our relationship public because the situation is unstable. Xavier is watching closely. I can't let the men lower their guard just because of you."

"Your most important task now is to help me fend off Xavier's attacks."

Ethan always tried to manipulate me like this.

Before, I thought this was his way of protecting me, so I worked even harder for him, fighting and scheming. But now I just found it absurd.

I put the boat rental form in front of him and said flatly, "I'm not sulking. I'm used to it."

Ethan sensed something unusual. Impatience flashed in his eyes, and his signature even tore through the paper.

"Aria! What's with the attitude? I'm just asking for your house. Everything on this island is mine, including your life. Can't I even use you anymore?"

He threw the paper in my face. "From now on, don't come to me for trivial things like going off the island for supplies. I don't have time for you..."

Knowing he misunderstood, I didn't explain.

I nodded perfunctorily and left, feeling relieved as I looked at the speedboat I was about to get.

I had helped Ethan expand his business for ten years.

We were childhood sweethearts, brothers who could trust each other with our lives, and even the most intimate lovers.

I had always hoped to marry him, and he had hinted that once he had the whole city in his hands, he would give me what I wanted.

But now I realized.

That was just my own wishful thinking and his lies woven to use my feelings.

Now he was going to marry someone else.

That night, a team of heavily armed mercenaries escorted Lily onto the island.

She was in a white dress, her naive eyes full of smug pride.

"Sister has worked hard for Ethan for over ten years, with great merit."

"I'll definitely get him to promote you, and send you some male models. We can't let sister's personal life suffer."

"Unlike Ethan, who can't wait another moment. He's marrying me tomorrow, oh my..."

I tightened my grip on the gun handle, barely restraining the urge to shoot her.

"Let's go." I coldly glanced at her and was about to leave.

But Lily stopped me, taking out a diary from her bag and saying slyly:

"These are the love notes Ethan wrote when he missed me all these years. It's too heavy to carry, so I'll trouble sister to throw it away for me."

With that, she swayed her skirt and left. Facing the cold wind blowing against the rocks, I trembled as I opened the diary.

April 12, 2024, when I protected him as we broke through an encirclement, he said "Lily, if I can survive this, I'll marry you."

August 5, 2023, when I heard he was ambushed by Xavier during a business trip. I took two machetes and single-handedly broke into the enemy camp to rescue him.

He said: "Baby, you smell so good today."

January 24, 2021, when he was arrested, I decided to take the blame for him, and he said:

"If it were you, I would never let you suffer like this."

Every word in the diary stabbed into my heart, as painful as if my heart was being carved out.

How many times had I begged Ethan to marry me, and he always kissed my forehead and said: "Aria, wait for me."

"I have too many enemies. I'm always afraid I haven't cleared the obstacles for you. When I have the whole city under control, I'll marry you, okay?"

But my countless urgings were only met with perfunctory responses.

On SnapChat, a reply finally came. The short two words were forceful, leaving me no way to turn back.

"Deal!"

I still couldn't help wanting to confirm something, so I asked:

"On August 5, 2024, you ambushed Ethan, right?"

The reply came instantly, each word dripping with blood:

"I'm completely innocent!"

"No way? So that's why you chased me for nine blocks with two machetes? It really wasn't me!"

I laughed bitterly.

So in Ethan's eyes, I was just a clown to be toyed with at will.

If so, why should I stay for them to mock?
