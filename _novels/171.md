Boyfriend planned for us to get our marriage certificate on 5/20, but I waited all day from morning till night, and he never showed up.

I called him dozens of times, but it was always busy.

Half an hour before City Hall closed, I received a photo from Phoebe.

In the photo, Jasper was holding a pregnancy test report in one hand and caressing her not-yet-showing belly with the other, looking utterly doting.

The message was quickly deleted.

A moment later, Jasper called me.

"Adeline, I was drugged a month ago and made a mistake, but the child is innocent. I have to take responsibility."

"Don't worry, once she has the baby, I'll send her abroad. It won't affect your position as my wife."

"Don't you like kids? Once the baby is born, I'll have them under your name, and you'll be their only mom."

When I didn't say anything, he added, sounding a bit guilty.

"Phoebe is very emotional because of her pregnancy and needs constant care. You should go home first. We'll talk about the certificate after she has the baby."

I clenched my phone, smiling bitterly.

Jasper, why would you think I, the heiress of New York's Johnson family, would want a man with a tarnished reputation?

I took a picture of the scene and sent it to his arch-enemy.

"Does your offer still stand?"
