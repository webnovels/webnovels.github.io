I am a legendary racing driver with seven consecutive championships. However, my navigator boyfriend's wrong directions caused me to crash during a race.

While semi-conscious, I overheard a conversation between him and my best friend.

"Finn, even if you're worried she'll win the championship and outshine my debut, this is too dangerous."

"What if you get hurt too?"

"I'm willing to take that risk for you. Besides, I've had enough over these years."

"So what if I lost to her a few times before? Why should I only be a navigator?"

"This time her hand is ruined, and I want to seize the chance to completely destroy her!"

Hearing the truth felt like a stab in the heart. One was the partner I trusted with my life, and the other was a friend I secretly supported in pursuit of her dreams.

I thought I was blameless, yet I was repaid with vile schemes. Since that's the case, I don't need to hold onto old feelings.

Finn Beckett's prestige as a top navigator and Eloise's long-cherished dream of stardom—I once helped build those paths, and I can just as easily take them away.
