I laughed bitterly. Zoe and Leo really were raised together - even their twisted logic was identical.

They fool around under the guise of a sister keeping her brother company on his birthday. They stand me up on my own birthday, and then have the nerve to blame me!

I coldly hung up on Leo, deleted the Instagram post, and made a new post clarifying my account had been hacked.

Then I sent the finalized divorce agreement to Zoe and blocked her and Leo's contact info.

However, an unknown number started blowing up my phone.

Thinking it was one of Zoe's tricks, I angrily answered:

"Mr. Evans, due to the withdrawal of medical support, your father has passed away. Please come to the hospital to claim the body as soon as possible."

My blood ran cold. I felt like I'd fallen into an icy pit.

I struggled to steady my shaking body, my voice trembling: "W-what? Could you please repeat that?"

The person patiently repeated the message.

My head was spinning. I couldn't accept this reality.

My father had a heart attack and became paralyzed 8 years ago. Although his heart surgery was successful, he needed long-term care and rehabilitation, requiring large monthly medical payments to keep him alive.

I had set up automatic payments for his medical fees long ago. How could the medical support possibly have been withdrawn?

I was silent for a long time. The staff member, likely used to people unable to accept a loved one's passing, suggested I log into the system to confirm myself.

I took a deep breath, held it, and logged in with my eyes squinted to tiny slits, afraid to look.

But I still gradually confirmed the fact of my father's death.

As grief overwhelmed me, a text came from the unknown number:

"Jack Evans, you've really done it now! Not only do you dare to bring up divorce, you even dare to block and delete me!"

"Did you forget that I control all your bank cards and assets? Now, unblock me immediately, add me back, and get on your knees to apologize! Otherwise your dad can just wait to die!"

So Zoe was the one who withdrew my father's medical support!

I stared at those vicious words with an icy gaze, wishing Zoe would die in my father's place.

Back then when Zoe said she felt insecure and feared I would cheat once I got rich, I put all my assets in her name.

I originally thought Zoe was just promiscuous and unfaithful. I never imagined she would be so vicious as to use my father's life to threaten me!

I gritted my teeth in hatred, my eyes blood-red, nearly crushing the phone in my grip.

Out of what little remained of our marital affection, I had planned to let her off easy.

But she shouldn't have been so vicious. She shouldn't have killed my father who was all I had left!

I will make her pay double for this!

The housekeeper brought over the Xu family's engagement token.

I opened it to find the phoenix jade pendant my first love had given me.

It came with a note that said: "Returning the jade intact."

This pendant was the token of love my first love had given me. Hers had a lovebird engraving.

The lovebird and phoenix, a perfect match made in heaven.

She said the pendants were family heirlooms, only given to their most beloved.

Later when we were forced to break up, the Xu family took back the pendant.

I never expected it would return to my hands again!

I suppressed my excitement and solemnly wrote on the paper: "Together until our hair turns white."
