Adeline left the country, and on that day, Asher chose to take sleeping pills to end his life.

In his farewell letter, he poured out all his love for her.

Yet he mentioned regretting marrying me.

When I opened my eyes again, I found myself five years in the past.

I watched with detachment as he and Adeline indulged in their fervent love.

I turned away, determined to treat him as a stranger.

But later, when he realized I no longer loved him, he knelt in the rain for three days and nights, begging me to return to him.
