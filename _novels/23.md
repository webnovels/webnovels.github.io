After I was forced to donate my kidney to my sister, she finally got pregnant with my husband's child. My parents and brother took my savings, my car, and my house to congratulate the newlyweds. On their wedding day, my best friend - the only one who knew about my death - sent a row of funeral wreaths... along with my death certificate.
I watched as a flicker of panic crossed the faces of my parents and brother, which had been cold towards me for over twenty years.
