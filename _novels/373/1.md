The Miller family and the Dubois family were set to join in marriage.

In the engagement photos released, my sister, Isabelle Dubois, wore a radiant smile, while my ex-husband, Alex Miller, looked at her with doting affection.

Actually, this was the second time they’d been photographed together in wedding attire.

The first time was at my own wedding.

Alex stood by my side in his groom's suit, while Isabelle, in a wedding dress, stood opposite me. She smiled brightly, extending a hand to my husband. "Alex, will you elope with me?"

My wedding ended abruptly and messily, but their story had just begun, painted in bold, dramatic strokes.

Back then, Alex had the security escort her out.

Now, after all that back and forth, they were finally together.

Some busybody dug up old photos from my wedding, capturing the scene of two women fighting over one man:

"If I were Chloe Dubois, I wouldn't even dare to show my face back at the Dubois family home. She wasted a loving couple's time for years."

"Isabelle Dubois is just too kind-hearted, still caring about her sister. She even specially invited her back for the wedding."

"Isabelle Dubois is still too naive. Isn't she afraid Chloe Dubois still harbors feelings for Alex? Especially now that Alex Miller is the head of the Miller family; so many people want to cling to him."

It seemed everyone sided with Isabelle Dubois.

My name is Chloe Dubois.

But my sister's name is Isabelle Dubois.

It was clear that Isabelle was the family's precious gem, the apple of their eye.

And I was the one blamed for my mother's death during childbirth.

When registering my name, my father casually pointed to a random name on the registration desk's list – Chloe. The clerk paused, a hint of pity in her eyes. And so, I was named Chloe.

My name could be changed, but my family's affections never would.

From childhood, anything Isabelle wanted, she eventually got.

And anything that was mine, Isabelle wanted.

Alex was an exception.

Despite Isabelle's endless attempts to lure him away, Alex remained unmoved, steadfastly choosing me.

For Isabelle's sake, my father even stooped so low as to beg Alex. "The Dubois family will be inherited by Isabelle. If you choose Isabelle, the Dubois family is willing to give up fifty percent of its profits."

Alex tightly gripped my trembling hand, his voice firm and resolute. "Mr. Dubois, my marriage is not a commodity. My alliance with the Dubois family is solely because I love Chloe."

After the wedding, due to Isabelle's outrageous behavior, many families interested in her backed out. My father, fearing Isabelle's sadness, sent her to London to study dance.

I once thought I was lucky, having stubbornly grown for years, finally chosen decisively by someone.

However, the time when passion fades is when the real test begins.

It was another thick, sultry night.

Alex's voice was hoarse as he coaxed me for another round, his hot breath caressing my collarbone.

A special notification sound rang out. Alex froze for a moment, glancing quickly at his phone. Then, the ravenous beast of a man transformed back into the polished, suited professional.

He kissed the sweat from my forehead. "There's a problem with business in the city. I need to go check it out."

After Alex left, I idly flipped through the books on the shelf.

It felt like destiny.

A book from the very top shelf, which I usually couldn't reach, just happened to fall, revealing the corner of a photo tucked inside.

I pulled it out casually, and froze.

It was a photo from my wedding with Alex.

But the main subject in the picture was Isabelle, her hand outstretched dramatically towards Alex.

The photo looked like it had been repeatedly caressed, its edges already frayed.

On the back of the photo was Alex's bold, flourishing script: "Maybe I'll never find love this raw and passionate again."

Clutching the photo that weighed a ton in my hands, I called Alex.

His voice was as gentle as ever. "Chloe, the weather in the city is very dry. My mouth is swollen from being overworked. Don't forget to drink plenty of water at home, okay?"

I said okay, then calmly hung up.

Alex was lying. He didn't notice, but in the background, Big Ben chimed. He was clearly in London. The city where Isabelle was.

The day I decided to divorce him, Isabelle took a knife for Alex, blocking an attack from his enemies. That knife wound damaged her spine, leaving her lower body paralyzed. Isabelle could never dance again.

When I rushed to the hospital, Alex was tightly holding Isabelle, sobbing and promising to take care of her for the rest of his life.

Seeing me arrive, Isabelle deliberately hooked her arm around Alex's neck, trying to kiss him. Alex saw me and frantically tried to pull away, but he couldn't bring himself to push away Isabelle, whose eyes were brimming with tears.

They kissed passionately, a long, silver thread of saliva stretching between their lips when they finally pulled apart.

I turned to leave, but after only a few steps, the world spun around me.

When I woke up again, the nurse chided me disapprovingly. "You're two months pregnant, and you still haven't been eating properly. You fainted from low blood sugar. Luckily, you were at the hospital."

My mind went blank. I didn't know how to face this tiny life. No matter what, Alex had to know.

"Alex, we have a..."

"Chloe, you're too reckless." Alex rushed in, his face full of disapproval. He didn't even have the patience to let me finish a sentence, much less notice my pale face.

My father, whom I hadn't seen in ages, reached out to hit me. Alex stopped him, but my father pointed at me, spitting venom. "You curse! Your sister is already in that state, and you have the audacity to fake illness just to drag Alex away!"

A chilling desolation settled deep in my soul. This was my family, my beloved.

Perhaps seeing how truly awful I looked, Alex stopped my father's tirade. "It's alright, Dad. Isabelle needs someone there. We should go back quickly."

Watching them walk towards the door without a backward glance, I spoke again. "Wait."

This time, Alex frowned, a flash of impatience crossing his face. "Chloe, I'll come back to see you in a bit."

"No need." I spoke calmly. "Alex, let's get a divorce."
