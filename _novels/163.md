When the richest man in the country—my dad—placed four photographs before me, my mind uncontrollably drifted back to the tragic events of my past life.

I was once my father's only heir, unaware of the malice in people's hearts due to my sheltered upbringing. I treated these four people as true friends, even sharing my jewelry and wealth with them.

Declan, however, was a devout Christian who never accepted my generosity; he was always locked away in church, praying, never sparing me a glance. I thought he didn’t love me until I inadvertently opened the church door one day and found him kneeling before a poor female student, kissing her feet with devotion: “Luna, you are my only faith, greater than even the Lord.”

Now that I’ve been reborn, I refuse to give them a good life again. Looking at my dad, I said firmly, “Dad, forgive me, but I want the one from the Johnson Family!”

Dad was shocked, his eyes wide. “You must be kidding. Everyone knows he’s a complete scoundrel! Plus, he supposedly has some unsavory habits. Are you sure you want someone like that?”

Of course, since I’ve been reborn, I must make the best choice for myself. But not long after, this man cornered me, and that’s when I realized he... had also been reborn.
