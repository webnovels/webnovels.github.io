Before the wedding, Gideon suffered a relapse of an old injury, resulting in temporary blindness, which made him irritable.
He frequently went out late at night to drink with friends and only returned at dawn.
On the night of the blizzard, I went to pick him up with my prenatal check-up report, only to find him at the bar entrance, discarding his sunglasses and white cane.
"Pretending to be blind is exhausting. I even have to use a special phone to fool Nora... But it's the only way to spend more time with my sweet Daphne before the wedding."
He wrapped his arm around the girl beside him and kissed her without a care.
"Listen, after the wedding, I plan to be a good husband and father. Daphne is getting married abroad, so don't tell Nora about this. If you ruin my happiness, I'll hold you accountable!"
But he was unaware of his impending leukemia diagnosis.
I entered this story world five years ago with the purpose of saving Gideon, and I was pregnant with the child that could save his life.
The snowy roads were treacherous, and on my way home, I had an accident, risking a miscarriage.
