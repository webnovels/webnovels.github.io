My wife called to say she had to work late on our anniversary, forcing me to cancel the carefully planned dinner reservation.

I was about to leave when I heard a commotion—a guest causing trouble in one of the executive suites.

I rushed up to the room, and the woman huddled behind the man, wrapped only in a hotel bath towel, was my wife, Scarlett Linwood.

Caught red-handed, Scarlett still tried to spin a lie.

“Honey, don’t jump to conclusions. The power went out at the office, and Finn and I had to rush over here to finish the pitch deck.”

Before I could say a word, Finn Donovan, the new intern she’d been mentoring, stepped in front of her.

“Oh, you must be Scarlett’s useless husband, right?”

“What standing does a kept man have to speak? Don’t you know the only reason the Linwood Group avoided total collapse this quarter is because I brought in the Ashby Group investment?”

“Get lost! You ruin this for me, and tomorrow I’ll have you bouncing checks at the unemployment office!”

I gave a cold laugh, utterly unmoved.

In Grand Harbor, no one dares tell Liam Ashford where he’ll be working tomorrow.

1

When I got Scarlett’s text saying she was "working late," I had already been waiting in the hotel lobby for three hours.

I’d booked the reservation for our anniversary a month ago, but once again, she stood me up.

I sighed. Her company, the Linwood Group, was in a major growth phase, and I kept telling myself this was just part of the sacrifice.

I was about to walk out when I heard the night manager frantically calling into his walkie-talkie.

“Hurry! Guests are causing a scene in 1808! I hear it involves someone from the Linwood Group!”

The Linwood Group?

My feet froze. That was Scarlett’s company.

I followed the manager into the elevator.

The door to 1808 was wide open. A man in nothing but boxer briefs was yelling obscenities at a room service attendant.

“You call this the best hotel in Grand Harbor? I paid eight hundred bucks for the Anniversary King Suite and there isn’t a complimentary condom? I’ll have your job!”

My eyes drifted past him. The entire world snapped into slow motion.

My wife, Scarlett, who was supposed to be working late, was plastered against the man’s back, clutching a towel, her cheeks flushed with an unnatural heat.

“H-Honey?!”

Seeing me, Scarlett’s face drained of all color. She fumbled, desperately pulling the towel tighter around herself.

My gaze moved slowly from Scarlett’s panic-stricken face to the crumpled sheets, then to the clothes scattered on the floor.

It felt like a sledgehammer had slammed into my chest, making every breath a painful, shallow gasp.

“Is this what you meant by ‘working late’?”

My voice was disturbingly calm.

Scarlett’s lips trembled, her eyes darting everywhere but mine.

“Liam, listen to me… The power went out at the office, and Finn and I absolutely had to come here to work on the presentation.”

I instantly understood the man’s identity. The new intern, Finn Donovan, the one she’d been mentioning constantly lately.

I couldn’t help but scoff.

“Does your company policy require you to wear a bath towel when you’re ‘working late’?”

Scarlett was about to try another excuse, but Finn stepped forward and casually slung his arm over her shoulder.

“Scarlett, this is your loser husband, right? A kept man checking up on you? Why are you even scared of him?”

Finn shot me a cocky middle finger. He was reveling in it.

“Cut the crap, you leech. It’s not the first time your wife and I have been together. A little late for a dramatic confrontation, isn’t it?”

My fists clenched instantly, knuckles white.

Scarlett’s face went pale. She tugged Finn’s arm. “Stop talking!”

Finn shook her off, his arrogance only mounting. He walked right up to me.

“What? You don’t like that? A deadbeat who lives off his wife is going to make a scene?”

He reached out and patted my cheek, a gesture loaded with pure contempt.

“Do you know who saved the Linwood Group this quarter? Me! I pulled in the Ashby investment! Without me, the Linwoods would be bankrupt right now!”

“And you—”

He leaned in close, his smile vicious.

“—you’re nothing but a pathetic pawn who doesn’t even know when his wife is getting plowed.”

The last thread of my restraint snapped.

My fist slammed into Finn’s face!

He staggered back and collapsed onto the floor, blood instantly gushing from his nose.

“Finn, are you okay!”

Scarlett shrieked and scrambled to cradle him.

Finn clutched his nose, staring up at me in disbelief. “You—a kept man—you actually hit me!”

“Hit you?”

I laughed, a cold, sharp sound. I grabbed a handful of his hair and smashed my fist into his face again.

“I’m just getting started!”

I kicked him hard in the stomach. He curled into a ball, his bravado replaced by wretched sobs.

“Call the cops! I’m calling the cops! You’re going to jail!”

Scarlett suddenly threw herself at me, grabbing my arm, her voice hysterical.

“Liam, you have to apologize to Finn! Get down on your knees and apologize! Do it now!”

I froze, slowly turning to look at the woman I had shared a bed with for five years.

Her eyes were wide with pleading, but none of it was for me.

When I didn’t move, Scarlett actually kicked me in the knee, trying to force me down.

“Do you have any idea who he is! If you let him call the police, your life is over!”

I laughed again, a different, more genuine laugh this time. I took out my phone.

“Go ahead. Call them. Right now.”

Scarlett stared at me, dumbfounded. Finn glowered, his face swollen.

“You’ll regret this, Liam! Tomorrow, you’ll be flipping burgers at the unemployment office!”

I looked down at the whimpering little pest. A cold smile curved my lips.

In all of Grand Harbor, no one tells me where I’m going to be working tomorrow.

…

We were barely through the police station door when Finn, clutching his swollen nose, started pounding the desk, his voice haughty.

“Officer, this man assaulted me without provocation! I demand a full medical check, jail time, and compensation!”

He slapped a business card onto the table. “I’m a partner of the Ashby Group! You know what to do!”

The officer looked at me with a frown. “Do you have anything to say?”

I calmly adjusted my cufflink and pointed toward the ceiling.

“He initiated the physical contact and the verbal abuse. The surveillance footage will be clear on that.”

Finn’s face paled. He grabbed the hotel manager, who had come along, and hissed a threat.

“You know who I am, right? Wipe the footage. Or your hotel is out of business tomorrow!”

The manager nervously glanced at me. I gave him a subtle, almost imperceptible nod. He instantly understood.

He feigned panic and agreed. “Donovan, sir, don’t worry! I’ll take care of it right away!”

Ten minutes later, the officer played the full video.

The monitor clearly showed Finn Donovan giving me the finger, repeatedly patting and striking my face, and spewing insults.

“Mr. Donovan, the evidence shows you initiated the confrontation.”

Finn’s face turned an ugly shade of green. He leaped up, hysterical.

“The footage is fake! Do you know who I am? I’ll have all of you fired!”

The officer’s voice was sharp. “Sit down! The evidence is clear. One more outburst and you’ll be charged with making a false report.”

As I left the station, Finn’s eyes burned into me. “You wait, Liam!”

I turned to walk away, but Scarlett blocked my path.

I thought she might finally offer an explanation for the night’s absurdity. Instead, she rushed to Finn’s side, tenderly examining his wounds, and then turned on me with cold blame.

“Liam, why did you hit him so hard! He’s just a kid!”

I was too stunned to be angry. I laughed bitterly.

“A kid? The kind of kid you take to a hotel suite and wear a towel for?”

Scarlett stammered, then regained her composure, her voice ringing with self-righteousness. “Finn did this for the company! The Ashby investment depends entirely on him! What did you do? Aside from hitting people? I’m taking him to the hospital. You go home and reflect!”

I grabbed her arm. My voice was ice.

“Scarlett Linwood, we’re getting a divorce.”

She flinched, then ripped her arm away, her voice spiraling into hysterics.

“Divorce? Liam, are you serious? You lied to me too! You said you had a million-dollar salary, and you’re nothing but a glorified hotel clerk! I did this for the company! Can’t you be supportive for once?”

I said nothing. I just turned and walked away.

Behind me, her voice was raw with fury. “Liam, you will regret this!”

Walking home, five years of memory flashed like a sped-up reel. Five years ago, Scarlett was the girl who stayed up late to make me coffee and hangover cures. On our wedding day, she promised me forever, blushing all the while.

Now, she was ready to sleep with anyone for a quick buck.

I pushed open the door. The air in our apartment was thick with familiarity. On the coffee table lay the anniversary gift I’d carefully wrapped. I knew I would never give it to her.

That night, I lay on our king-size bed, staring at the ceiling until dawn.

Scarlett never came home.

When the sun finally rose, my mother-in-law’s shrill voice sliced through the silence of the phone call.

“Liam! Do you have any decency? It’s your father-in-law’s 50th birthday party, and everyone is waiting for you! Where the hell are you? Get over here now!”

She hung up. I took out the pre-printed divorce papers. I also received a text from my night manager.

“Mr. Ashford, we found a woman’s expensive watch in 1808. Should I return it to Ms. Linwood?”

I looked at our wedding photo on the wall and smiled. “No need. Along with everything else in that room…”

“Burn it.”

The Linwood estate was ablaze with light. My father-in-law, Robert Linwood’s, 50th birthday celebration was in full swing.

The moment I stepped into the foyer, I heard Scarlett’s overly sweet voice.

“Everyone, let me introduce you to Finn Donovan, the savior of the Linwood Group!”

Finn was in a sharp suit. Even with the bruising on his face, he still carried himself with a smug arrogance.

“And today, I’ve brought a very important guest!”

The entrance doors opened, and a portly man in an expensive suit walked in.

“Victor Ashby! Director of Acquisitions for the Ashby Group, and my direct mentor!”

The room erupted in gasps.

“Oh my god! It’s really the Ashby Group!”

“Mr. Donovan is incredibly connected! He even managed to get an Ashby executive here!”

My father-in-law, Robert, was shaking with excitement. He rushed over. “Mr. Ashby, what an honor! You grace us with your presence!”

Victor Ashby nodded dismissively, his eyes scanning the room.

“Finn told me there was a spectacle today, so I thought I’d drop by.”

Finn immediately pointed at me, his voice carrying over the crowd.

“Everyone, this is Scarlett’s gold-digging husband! Last night, he assaulted me, and now he has the audacity to crash the birthday party!”

The guests started whispering, their eyes filled with scorn for me.

Scarlett’s face shifted. She quickly moved to my side and hissed under her breath.

“Who told you to come? Leave! Now, before you ruin everything!”

I looked at her panicked expression and felt a cruel amusement.

“What? Afraid I’ll spoil your fun?”

I sneered and slammed the divorce papers onto the nearest table.

“Don’t worry. I’m only here to finalize the divorce.”

Scarlett’s face went white. She gripped my sleeve, trembling. “Honey, you’re doing this for real? I can explain what happened last night…”

I pulled my arm away.

“No need to explain, Scarlett. Don’t make me pity you any more than I already do.”

Seeing his chance, Finn fanned the flames.

“Oh, the deadbeat wants a divorce? Fine. But with Mr. Ashby here, it won’t be that simple!”

Victor Ashby’s bloated figure shifted. He looked me up and down and gave a malicious smile.

“You’ll kneel down. Right here, in front of everyone. You’ll knock your head on the floor three times, strip naked, and crawl out of here.”

The room exploded with laughter.

“Hahaha, that’s a brilliant idea, Mr. Ashby! What a show!”

“The kept man deserves it!”

“Go on! Don’t waste our time!”

I scanned the room, looking at their ugly, greedy faces. Even my own in-laws, whom I had tried to respect, watched me with sheer disgust.

“Don’t just stand there! Get on your knees as Mr. Ashby asked! If pleasing the Ashby Group is what it takes to save our company, then it’s your good fortune to help!” my mother-in-law yelled.

Seeing I wasn’t moving, Finn assumed I was terrified and became even more aggressive.

“Useless trash! Doesn’t even have the balls for this!”

He gestured to the bouncers nearby.

“He won’t do it himself, so let’s help him out. We can’t let Mr. Ashby’s trip be a waste!”

A few large men moved toward me, ready to tear my clothes off.

Just then, Scarlett’s executive assistant burst through the door, looking like she’d seen a ghost.

“Mr. Linwood! Ms. Linwood! It’s a disaster!” The assistant was white-faced, clutching a stack of files. Her voice trembled.

“The SEC just announced an investigation! They’re questioning our financials and freezing all our accounts! Every major partner is terminating their contracts immediately!”

“What!”

Scarlett shot up, her color draining entirely.

“That’s impossible! Our books were fine—”

She stopped midsentence, her gaze involuntarily flicking toward Finn.

Finn seemed to realize something too. His face contorted, and he instantly jumped to clear himself.

“It wasn’t me! The company accounts were always handled by Liam!”

Every eye in the room swiveled to me.

Scarlett froze, looking at me, wanting to speak, but finally saying nothing.

My mother-in-law rushed forward, her sharp nails nearly scratching my face.

“You snake! You’ve been working against us the whole time! We took you in all these years, and this is how you repay the Linwood family!”

I watched them with cold derision.

“You were afraid I’d ‘muscle in’ on your family business, so you never let me into the Linwood Group. Now that you’re in trouble, you remember me?”

Scarlett grabbed my hand, tears welling up.

“Honey, please. You have to find a way to save the Linwood Group.”

I shook her hand off.

“A way? Don’t you have your savior, Mr. Donovan, right here?”

Finn’s face was shifting from green to white. Suddenly, he latched onto Victor Ashby’s arm like a drowning man.

“Victor! Help the Linwoods! With the Ashby Group’s resources, this is nothing!”

Victor Ashby frowned, sighing dramatically. “This is a tough one…”

“Please, Mr. Ashby, we beg you! If you help, the Linwoods will do anything!” My high-minded father-in-law was pleading.

Victor Ashby’s lecherous eyes raked over Scarlett. He lowered his voice. “I could help. If Ms. Linwood agrees to spend the next month as my exclusive companion, perhaps—”

“We agree!”

Robert Linwood didn’t hesitate for a second.

My mother-in-law nodded vigorously. “Yes! Scarlett, for the company, you just have to endure this!”

Scarlett looked like she’d been struck by lightning. She stared at her parents in disbelief, then turned her pleading eyes to Finn.

To my surprise, Finn eagerly pushed her toward Victor.

“Scarlett, it’s the only way! You’ve already slept with two men—what’s one more?”

Victor Ashby grinned triumphantly and reached out for Scarlett.

“Come on, Ms. Linwood. Let’s find a quiet room to discuss the details…”

“CRASH!”

I kicked over the nearby coffee table. The sound of shattering glass silenced everyone.

“Victor Ashby, are you sure you want to touch my person?”

I slowly rose to my full height, my eyes like sharp knives.

Victor was visibly shaken by my intensity, stepping back half a pace, but quickly recovered and sneered. “What? The deadbeat trophy husband is playing the hero?”

Just then, the front door of the villa was violently thrown open.

A middle-aged man strode in, quickly scanning the room.

The moment Victor saw him, his eyes widened with surprise and joy.

“Brother! What are you doing here!”

I raised my phone, interrupting Victor’s question.

“Apologies, I’m the one who called him.”
