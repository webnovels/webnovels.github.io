Jack looked at Rachel, seeming to want to say something but holding back.

Rachel tapped his forehead, her tone intimate: "Jack, what is it that you can't tell me?"

Jack clenched his fist, as if making up his mind to speak.

"Rachel, Luke has always been the ace bomb disposal expert in your team, and with you assisting this time, how could the bomb explode? Could it be that..."

Jack didn't continue, but left room for endless imagination.

A raging fire of anger surged in my heart, my hands clenched into fists, wishing I could rush forward and give him a couple of punches.

I was already dead, yet he still wouldn't let me go, trying to poison Rachel against me.

As a police officer, I knew my responsibilities and never brought personal emotions into work.

Although I already knew Rachel didn't love me, I thought that after working together for six years, she should understand my character.

The next second, Rachel's words shattered my illusions.

"I was wondering why the bomb suddenly exploded when we were defusing it so well. It must be that lunatic Luke deliberately trying to harm you. I'm going to report him to the police force. He doesn't deserve to be a police officer!"

Rachel's face was red with anger.

I had no doubt that if I appeared in front of her now, she would definitely slap me and then curse me viciously.

At this moment, my heart was filled with bitterness.

Had I overestimated my image in Rachel's heart, or was Jack so important to her that she would believe whatever he said?

Probably both.

Six years of being together couldn't buy even a little trust from her.

Now, I was probably just a despicable villain in her heart.

But I still remembered what she had said at our wedding, "You're not just my husband, but also my comrade-in-arms whom I'll trust for a lifetime."

Now, it only took a light remark from Jack for her to forget her past promises.

I suddenly wanted to know, when she learns of my death, will she regret the words she said today?

Rachel paced back and forth in the room, unable to vent her anger.

She took out her phone and sent me messages.

"Luke, how dare you tamper with the bomb, I'll make you pay for this!"

"Don't think I don't know you can't die, reply to me right now."

Rachel stared at her phone intently, but after one minute, two minutes passed, there was still no reply.

In the past, I would always reply to her messages within ten seconds.

Rachel's chest heaved up and down with anger.

"Fine, pretend to be dead then. Don't think I can't do anything about you."

She called a colleague who had stayed at the scene, not even waiting for the other end to speak before she shouted angrily: "Tell Luke I know all about his dirty tricks, he'd better be prepared to face disciplinary action!"

An anxious voice came from the other end of the phone: "Luke hasn't come out yet, the fire hasn't been put out and we can't get in. He might really be in trouble."

Rachel sneered, her tone icy cold.

"He won't die. I think he's just hiding because he's afraid of being held accountable. You tell him this trick won't work. He almost killed Jack, I will definitely get to the bottom of this!"

With that, she angrily hung up the phone, still cursing under her breath.

A flash of smugness passed through Jack's eyes, but he pretended to be magnanimous.

"Rachel, it's normal for men to be jealous. Luke was probably just momentarily confused. Let it go."

But Rachel glared at him with a stern face.

"How can we let it go! Your body hasn't been good since the car accident, and this time if it weren't for the blast shield, your life could have been in danger. We can't let him off easily!"

Jack hugged Rachel emotionally, the two looking like a couple who had survived a disaster together.
