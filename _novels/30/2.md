I was a task executor who had crossed over to this world, and my mission was to make Rachel marry me.

The year I met Rachel, she was, like me, a newly recruited bomb disposal officer in the police force.

At that time, her first love Jack had broken up with her abruptly to go abroad, leaving Rachel in a daze every day. It was I who stayed by her side constantly, helping her out of the gloom.

Three years later, we naturally became husband and wife, and my mission was successfully completed.

The system gave me a reward: I could stay in this world and had two chances to revive.

At that time, I had also truly fallen in love with Rachel.

I believed that the most important thing between husband and wife was honesty, so I told her about the system without reservation.

I even jokingly said, "No matter what, I won't die. I can stay with you until we're old."

But I never thought that this sentence would become my death warrant.

Shortly after we got married, Jack returned from abroad.

Jack only shed a few tears in front of Rachel, explaining that going abroad was entirely his parents' wish, which he couldn't disobey.

Rachel believed him without hesitation.

She seemed to forget the pain Jack had caused her back then and started following him around, caring for his every need.

She even begged me to use the system to save Jack when he was in a life-threatening car accident.

When I saw Rachel crying her eyes out, I couldn't say I wasn't heartbroken.

How could I not be sad and angry when my wife was shedding tears for another man?

But I loved Rachel deeply, and I couldn't refuse her request.

So, the first chance to revive was used up.

Last year, after Rachel had finished defusing a bomb and was about to return to the team, she was shot by a criminal who had fought back, right in the heart.

When Rachel was sent to the hospital, the doctor took one look and issued a death notice.

I couldn't accept Rachel leaving me, so I resolutely gave her my last chance.

Before reviving Rachel, the system had repeatedly asked me if I was sure, as this was the last chance. Wouldn't I regret it?

I answered firmly: "I won't regret it."

The system agreed, and after that, it never appeared again.

At that time, I thought Rachel's feelings for Jack were just an obsession, and that with time, she would naturally come to her senses and return to our family.

And I firmly believed that I could grow old with Rachel.

But now, the cruel reality had given me a harsh wake-up call.

It turned out that Rachel had always only loved Jack.

And I was just deluding myself.
