After leaving the hospital, Rachel took Jack directly home, using the excuse that he was injured and couldn't manage daily life conveniently.
As soon as they entered, Jack took out slippers in a familiar manner, and even accurately found the location of the remote control to turn on the TV.
This series of familiar actions all demonstrated that Rachel had brought him to our home many times before.
Rachel went to the kitchen and started cooking, muttering about what Jack liked to eat.
Jack looked at her tenderly.
"Rachel, it's been so long since I've tasted your cooking."
In our three years of marriage, Rachel had never cooked. She said she didn't know how.
I didn't mind and took over all the cooking and other household chores.
Now it seems, she just didn't cook for me.
During dinner, Rachel's phone suddenly rang, with a suppressed crying voice coming through.
"You need to come quickly, Luke... he's dead."
Rachel rolled her eyes, not believing a word.
"Emily, I know you're close to Luke, but there's no need to use such a clumsy excuse to trick me. He can't die."
Emily didn't expect her to respond like this. She paused, then cried even louder.
"I'm really not lying, Luke..."
Before Emily could finish, Rachel hung up the phone.
"Luke is really going too far, trying to use such a lie to make us forgive him. Ha, absolutely not!"
"Even if something happened to him, he has the system to save him. How could he possibly die?"
Jack chimed in: "He's probably just jealous. Men understand men, Rachel, don't be too angry."
Hearing this, Rachel slammed down her chopsticks, looking even more angry.
"If he doesn't apologize to you properly when he comes back, I'll divorce him!"
My heart felt like it was stuffed with a wad of cotton, unable to breathe.
When I begged her not to take away the blast shield, I had already told her that I only had two chances to revive.
But she didn't believe me at all, thinking I was just being jealous.
Even now when someone told her about my death, she thought it was my lie, and even wanted to use divorce to threaten me.
But this trick would never work again.
After dinner, Jack directly lay down on the bed that belonged to Rachel and me.
The temperature in the room was rising, and the two of them were getting closer and closer.
I desperately wanted to escape from here, but a force confined me to the room, unable to leave.
Just as they were about to kiss, Rachel suddenly sat up.
She tugged at the corner of her mouth: "Jack, your hand is injured, you should focus on recovering."
With that, she fled to the next bedroom.
I couldn't quite understand. Wasn't this what Rachel wanted?
Early the next morning, Rachel prepared a table full of breakfast and left a note with detailed instructions and reminders before she felt at ease to leave for work.
At the police station, Rachel found everyone staring at her with sympathetic gazes.
She didn't understand and casually asked a colleague why they were staring at her like that.
The colleague was about to speak when the chief suddenly called Rachel over.
Rachel felt a bit puzzled: "Chief, what's going on?"
The chief patted her shoulder and led her to the door of the morgue.
"Rachel, my condolences."
Rachel felt a bit panicked but suppressed the unease in her heart.
"Chief, what are you talking about? Everyone in my family is fine, what condolences?"
The chief sighed: "After the bomb exploded yesterday, Luke didn't manage to escape successfully. He died at the scene. His body is inside."
Rachel smiled stiffly: "Chief, don't joke with me. That explosion was Luke's own doing, he couldn't possibly die. He must be hiding because he's afraid of being held accountable."
The chief's expression became serious when he heard Rachel slandering me.
"Rachel! Luke is your husband and a police officer. How can you question his professional ethics!"
"The body in the morgue is indeed his. We've already verified the DNA. If you don't believe it, go see for yourself."
Rachel swallowed hard, hesitantly walking forward, still not backing down.
"I'll look then. It must be a fake body up there. Luke must have used some trick to escape."
Rachel's hand hovered over the white cloth, her trembling hands revealing her unsettled heart.
She slowly lifted the white cloth...
