The day I had my traumatic delivery, Damon Thorne was globe-trotting with his mistress.
When he finally came back, he just handed me divorce papers.
"Sign them, Ashley. I specifically waited until you recovered before bringing up the divorce. That's pretty considerate of me, right? By the way, I don't want the kid, cuz Serena will give me plenty of kids later."
I didn't say a word. Just took the pen and signed.
Besides, I had my own wedding to get to, with the man I actually loved.
Three months later, right after my wedding, the hospital administration called me back for an emergency.
Apparently, the female patient suffered a rupture of the corpus luteum following sexual intercourse with multiple partners.
I pushed open the door and took one look. And wouldn't you know it?
Lying on the operating table was none other than my ex-husband's mistress.

I looked down, carefully checking the patient's name.
Serena.
I'd really thought Damon found some perfect, pure love. Turns out his taste runs a little... wilder than I'd imagined.
I remembered the day I gave birth. I'd hemorrhaged badly due to complications during labor.
The doctors kept frantically calling for my family.
But Damon's phone remained unreachable.
Photos of him and Serena, cozying up in and out of hotels, were plastered all over social media.
I nearly died that day. When I finally woke up, Damon appeared.
His face held a hint of impatience. "Ashley, why do you always have to make such a mess of yourself? You're an Oxford-educated doctor, for crying out loud. Did you have to have this baby for me? I don't even like it. Your idea of using a child to secure your place is just pathetic."
He hadn't even finished speaking when his phone rang.
He answered it without a hint of hesitation. "Serena..."
The voice on the other end cut him off.
"Damon, is my birthday surprise ready? You said you were just going to check on that old hag at the hospital. It's been half an hour, why aren't you back yet? I heard she even hemorrhaged? Damon, hurry back. Don't let her problems get to you."
Damon chuckled.
"Only Serena cares about me. I'm coming right back. The birthday gift has been ready for ages. I promise you'll be screaming my name so loud you won't be able to walk straight for days!"
Damon walked out as he spoke, not sparing me another glance.
Of course, it never occurred to him to even look at our child.
Thankfully, I wasn't too heartbroken.
After confirming the baby was perfectly fine, I could finally talk to Mr. Hayes, Damon's grandfather, about the promise we made.
I called him myself. "Mr. Hayes, the baby is safe. May I leave now?"
My marriage to Damon was forced by his grandfather. I originally refused, but that very night, my parents were in a car accident. While not life-threatening, I couldn't refuse anymore.
Mr. Hayes had promised that if I gave them a worthy heir, he wouldn't stand in the way of a divorce.
The truth was, I'd had a boyfriend for ten years at that point.
He knew the truth and had been waiting for me all this time.
After my call, Mr. Hayes sighed.
"I've seen the news these past few days. A forced relationship never thrives, so I'll let you go. But you're still weak, so I've arranged for a professional nursing team. Please recover fully before you leave."
