It was a recorded livestream.
In the dim stage light, Gabriel was singing passionately, while only one person's silhouette could be seen in the empty VIP seats.
And it was someone I knew all too well.
Jenny's tone was harsh, her hair almost crackling with anger: "This livestream has already topped the trending list. Now the whole world knows your boyfriend has a girlfriend."
"Chloe Adams, let's go right now—"
"Jenny."
I suddenly interrupted her, my gaze fixed on the screen that was replaying the loop, and said softly:
"You know what?"
"I was the first person to hear this song years ago."
That's why I could overlook Gabriel's repeated mistakes.
Because he said this song was written for me.
In those years when he was still unknown, he said I was the only listener he wanted to keep.
Jenny fell silent for a moment, then took back the phone I was gripping tightly.
"So what are you going to do now? The party's over. Are you going to walk down the aisle alone next time too?"
She shook my shoulders angrily: "Wake up! How long are you going to keep up this one-woman show?"
I didn't answer her, just forced myself to stand up.
The anxiety that had been building all day finally subsided, leaving only one thought in my mind:
At least nothing bad had happened to him.
Wrapped in fatigue and discomfort, there was no room for excess emotions. I closed my eyes to calm myself, then sent Gabriel a final message:
"What time are you coming home?"
