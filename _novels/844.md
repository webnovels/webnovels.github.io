In the dimly lit corner of the bedroom, a faint light flickered.

Standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, Elena Jordan held the phone to her ear, listening in silence to her parents' earnest pleas as her face remained expressionless.

"Elle, we won't force you into an arranged marriage. Just come back and inherit the billion-dollar family estate.

"If you insist on marrying your boyfriend, we won't look down on his ordinary background. We'll respect your choice."

On the other end of the line, the Jordans, who had only recently reunited with their biological daughter, spoke with heartfelt sincerity.

Elena remained silent for a moment, as if making a firm decision before finally speaking. "I'll come back. I agree to the arranged marriage. As for Blake... I'll make things clear to him and end it for good."

"That's wonderful! The Gilbert family is a perfect match for us, and Dante is an outstanding man. With him protecting you, we can finally be at ease."

Elena's parents, Tate Jordan and Sophie Stevens, were overjoyed, yet a hint of sentimentality crept into their voices. "But you've been with Blake for two years. You'll be leaving in half a month. Take this time to say a proper goodbye."

Two whole years… Memories surged back, and a flicker of pain flashed in Elena's eyes.

Yes, it had been two years. They had known and loved each other for two long years.

They had worked tirelessly for two years, staying up all night to save enough for a 750-square-feet apartment's down payment in Saint Reton.

For two years, they had shared the most intimate and romantic moments a couple could have, believing they were each other's only home.

She had always thought she was lucky. Life had been tough, but fate had given her the perfect lover. Yet behind perfection lay a cruel truth.

Elena remained motionless for a long time in the darkness—until the roar of an engine sounded outside. As if waking from a dream, she hastily wiped away the redness in her eyes.

The front door of the living room swung open, and the crisp, familiar scent of a man filled the air. Elena's boyfriend of two years, Blake Kingston, was home.

He walked in hurriedly and pulled her into a tight embrace, inhaling deeply as if savoring the scent of her perfume. His deep, magnetic voice murmured near her ear as he slipped a cool piece of paper into her hand.

"Honey, I'm sorry I worked late last night and couldn't be with you. To make it up to you, I bought you a star. Look—do you like it?"

Elena turned slightly, her gaze sweeping over the cheap certificate in her hand. Without much emotion, she let out a faint hum in response.

Sensing her indifference, Blake felt something was off. He instinctively held her even tighter, his tone turning more careful.

"Are you mad at me for working overtime and neglecting you? I'm doing it for our future, you know. I don't want you to keep living in a rented apartment with me forever.

"It's the weekend now, and I'll make it up to you."

As he spoke, he cupped the back of her head and kissed her without giving her a chance to resist. For lovers, kissing and embracing should have been the most natural and blissful things in the world.

But now, Elena recoiled instinctively, feeling disgust rising in her throat. Her mind kept replaying what she had seen at Blake's office the night before.

It was around 10:00 pm, and the workspace lights had been turned off, leaving the place empty. Only the CEO's office in the distance remained dimly lit. Elena had taken a few steps forward, and her eyes immediately widened in disbelief.

The desk was a mess, and her boyfriend—who had told her just ten minutes earlier that he was still working—was pinning their CEO, Gabriella Sadberry, against the wall.

He said in a fawning manner, "Gabby, when will you come back to me?

"You wanted revenge on Elena because your first love glanced at her a few times, so I helped you out. I hid my identity and stayed with Elena for the past two years.

"I ate her food, used her money, and treated her like a free maid. Isn't that enough payback for you?

"If you've had your fun, then come back to me. I dream about marrying you and having a baby with you."

Gabriella smirked, her fingers trailing lazily over his lips as she laughed seductively.

"There's no rush. Let's see how you prove yourself first.

"But I am curious—once you return to your status as the Kingstons' privileged heir in Saint Reton's elite circle, aren't you afraid Elena will cling to you?"

Blake didn't even hesitate. "I know her kind. She's just another broke woman who loves money. When the time comes, I'll throw some cash at her and be done with it."

A deafening buzz filled Elena's mind. The heating in the office was turned up high, yet she was shivering uncontrollably.

Only now did she realize that she had been dating an heir to Saint Reton's elite circle for two years without knowing it. The love he had shown her had been nothing more than an act.

His so-called struggles, and their shared hardships—everything had been a well-crafted illusion to please the woman he truly loved.

The man she had once trusted with her heart and soul… It seemed he had only seen her as a tool for his amusement from the very beginning.

…

At that moment, just as Blake's lips were about to touch hers, Elena couldn't hold it in. She quickly gagged.

Blake froze for a moment, his expression shifting from shock to concern. His voice turned cautious, even nervous as he asked "Honey, are you feeling sick? What's wrong?"

He wrapped an arm around her, carefully carrying her to the bathroom. He then gently wiped the corners of her mouth, tending to her like a devoted lover.

Even so, Elena remained unresponsive. She knew now that everything he did was just an act, a performance of the perfect boyfriend.

It was time to wake up.

Just then, Blake's phone screen lit up suddenly in the bathroom.

A notification flashed across the screen: "Your 99-cent Wish.com star certificate including shipping has been delivered."

Right below it was another new message. "Come to the star observatory you gave me. I'm going to break up with him."

The sender was Gabriella.

A flicker of excitement crossed Blake's eyes. He hurriedly tucked his phone away and came up with an excuse.

"It looks like the proposal from last night needs revisions. I have to go to the office. I'll make it up to you later."

The door then slammed shut with a bang. Elena watched his reflection in the mirror disappear completely.

Droplets of water slid down the glass, leaving behind streaks akin to tears. Her heart turned ice cold.

That star observatory was worth 50 million dollars. Rumor had it that an admirer had gifted it to Gabriella. Later, another 20 million dollars was spent renovating it to match her tastes.

Now she knew that that admirer was Blake. How laughable. The man who spent tens of millions to stargaze with Gabriella—was her Blake.

Yet the same man who bought Elena a fake star certificate for 99 cents on a bargain site—was also him.

The difference wasn't just the amount of money spent. It was the unbridgeable gap between love and indifference.

She laughed and laughed, up until her face was streaked with cold tears. She then wiped the corners of her eyes forcefully, and her gaze hardened with resolve.

She would cut off this so-called love, once and for all. A fake star and a love that never existed. She wanted none of it!
