"I was born with a gift, or maybe a curse: my blood heals anything.

Last time around, I cured some rich boy, Preston Fairchild, who couldn't move his legs.

Turns out, his family had promised that whoever fixed him would become his wife.

He was forced to marry me. Can you believe that?

Then Preston's real girlfriend, Scarlett, who’d been risking her life to find some rare flower to cure him, heard the news and, heartbroken, fell off a cliff and was presumed dead.

A year later, Preston found Scarlett's body frozen in the mountains.

And guess what? He made me cut my wrists open to save her.

""You bitch! If Scarlett had brought back that flower, we could have been happy together. You ruined everything!""

""You claim your blood is magic, then bring her back to life!""

I begged him, tears streaming down my face.

""Scarlett has been dead for a year. I can heal, not raise the dead.""

But Preston wouldn't listen. He just watched me bleed out.

When I woke up, I was back at the Fairchilds' mansion, the day they asked me to heal Preston.

I looked at him in that wheelchair, his face like thunder, and gave a cold smile.

""Your legs, Preston, they're as good as gone. Nobody can fix them."""
