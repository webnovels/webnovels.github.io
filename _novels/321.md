"Because Chase Lancaster’s childhood sweetheart faked a suicide attempt, our wedding was called off again and again.

I was humiliated in front of all our friends and family. My mom was so upset, she kept fainting and ending up in the hospital.

Chase was filled with regret. He held my hands, promising it would never happen again.

I believed him.

But the next time I stood in the center of a crowd, wearing my wedding dress, Lily Albright stormed into the ceremony wearing a dress stained with what looked like blood.

As a doctor, I immediately recognized it was just dye, artificial coloring. But when I tried to explain to Chase, he slapped me so hard, I fell to the ground.

“She could be dying, and you’re trying to stop me? What the hell is wrong with you? If anything happens to her, you’ll all pay!”

He ran off, carrying her in his arms, without a backward glance.

My mother had a heart attack, right there in my arms, and died.

Chase celebrated Lily’s recovery by setting off fireworks all over town.

I was in the hospital, dealing with my mother's arrangements when I got a text from him.

“Trust me. This will never happen again.”

My face was pale, empty of emotion. He was right, it really wouldn’t happen again.

Because we were done."
