I died during the cooling-off period of my ninth divorce from Olivia Reed.

My soul hovered above the VIP hospital room, watching her spend millions on her childhood sweetheart's scribble of a painting.

She looked at my body, riddled with tubes, her voice ice-cold:

"Adam Carter, stop pretending. Ethan's auction is waiting for me."

"Sign this debt transfer document, and we're done."

I couldn't answer, so she took it as resistance.

She pulled out her final trump card:

"If you don't wake up right now, I'll cut off all expenses for that burden!"

"Do you want her to starve to death?!"

Just then, my daughter's pale soul appeared beside me.

She looked up at me, her hollow eyes full of confusion:

"Daddy, why did Mommy call Emily a 'burden'?"

"Daddy... I'm so hungry."
