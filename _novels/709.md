Chapter 1
My head started throbbing again. The last thing I remembered before I lost consciousness was being on the cruise with my friends, celebrating. The wind had blown my hat away, and when I bent down to look for it, I lost my balance and fell off the ship.

 I was pressing my temples when my best friend, Lily Green, walked in.

 "Seraphina, you're awake?"

 Lily rushed over, hugging me tightly, her eyes red. "I'm so relieved you're okay. I was terrified when you jumped—right after you did, I was about to call a doctor."

 "Don’t panic. It’s just a little bump on the head. No big deal. But, um... who’s this tall, handsome guy next to me?" I glanced at the imposing stranger beside me, a little confused. "He looks a bit scary. Are there other patients in here?"

 Lily stared at me, eyes wide in disbelief. "You don’t recognize Alpha Victor? He’s from our tribe! How could you not know him?" Then, she screamed, "Doctor! Come quickly! Seraphina must have lost her memory!"

 Lily dashed out of the room, leaving me alone with the strange man, who leaned over, his voice cold. "You’re pretending to have amnesia, huh? Trying to play the innocent little thing? Is that fun?"

 "Hey, who are you? Stay away from me! Where’s Alpha Alexander?"

 The man scoffed, exhaling smoke in my direction and choking me in the process. "A simp—that’s all he was. He ran off the moment things got tough."

 "Seraphina, if you're going to keep playing dumb, I’m taking back everything I said," the man muttered as he left, his words lingering like a bad taste. When Lily returned with the doctor, I was still coughing from the secondhand smoke.

 "Doctor, please check! My friend—she’s lost her memory!" Lily was fussing, practically dragging the doctor toward me. I rolled my eyes.

 "Stop making stuff up! We’ve been best friends since we were six. We even work at the same company and live together! How could I have memory loss?"

 "But... how could you forget Alpha Victor? You’ve been chasing him for ten years!" Lily’s words left me speechless. I blankly followed the doctor’s instructions for a series of tests.

 The conclusion? A mild concussion—nothing serious. Just rest and eat something nutritious.

 On the way back, I couldn’t shake the confusion. "Lily, why did you say I liked Victor Hale? Isn’t it Alpha Alexander I like?"

 Lily sighed deeply. "Alpha Alexander is seriously upset with you. He probably won’t be back for a while."

 That evening, I forced Lily to tell me everything about Victor.

 Lily recounted the tragic tale of how I had become a simp for Victor, a human girl throwing away her dignity for love.

 Like the time I folded 999 paper cranes for him, only for him to throw them off his balcony without reading a single note I’d written. Or the designer watch I bought with my part-time earnings, which he immediately gave to someone else. I’d acted as his housekeeper—cleaning his place and making him meals, all while being subservient, without any boundaries.

 There were nights when I picked him up from drunken binges, taking him and his girlfriend to a hotel room.

 I had done it all—no principles, just pure devotion.

 Hearing all this made my skin crawl.

 No way. I wasn’t that pathetic.

 I covered her mouth. "Stop it! I don’t believe it. I’m not like that. Let’s go to sleep. The new product launch is tomorrow. Don’t be late."

 "You really didn’t forget? Alright, I’ll tell the boss you don’t need a day off."

 Shoving thoughts of Victor aside, I messaged Alexander Stone: "When are you coming back?"

 I waited for a while, but there was no reply. Slowly, I drifted off to sleep.

 After over 15 years of friendship with Alexander, I couldn’t tell if it was dependence or affection.

 All I knew was that with him around, I felt safe.

 I didn’t know what had caused him to leave this time, but I wouldn’t let some narcissistic jerk ruin our bond.

 "Seraphina, wake up! You’re going to be late for the launch!"

 I opened my eyes and shot Lily a resentful look. "The foie gras I was about to eat is gone. Couldn’t you wait two more minutes to wake me up?"

 Lily tapped my forehead. "Now you’re craving foie gras? Wasn’t this the same person who swore off meat for three months and promised to lose weight to below 90 pounds?"

 I shot up in shock. "Three months without meat? You might as well tell me to go run around naked!"

 "Get up and get ready. It’s not me pushing you; it’s because Alpha Victor said he likes slim girls, and you’ve been weighing your food down to the gram every day."

 I shook my head, trying to empty my mind, and without another thought, I hurried with Lily to the launch event.


Chapter 2
At the entrance, a tall, sharply dressed man stood with one hand resting on his watch. "You're ten minutes late. If this happens again, your bonus for the month is gone."

 "It's only 8:40, the launch doesn’t start until 9. How am I late?" I pulled out my phone to counter.

 "The launch requires you to be here half an hour earlier for preparation. Don’t you know that?"

 "Sorry, Mr. Carter. We'll get ready right away." Lily tugged at my arm, signaling me to stop arguing.

 Once we were in the studio, I couldn’t help but complain. "Maxwell Carter’s mouth really overshadows his handsome face."

 "Well, he’s serious about his work. I think that’s a good thing," Lily defended him.

 "You…" Just as I was about to tease Lily, I spotted an unwelcome guest.

 The person I hated most back in school was here at the launch event.

 "Just bumped your head and came to work? Trying to act weak in front of Alpha Victor to make him feel sorry for you?" Grace Miller sneered, her nostrils so high I could almost see her nose hairs.

 I couldn’t stand her smug attitude. I moved in close and whispered in her ear, "I suggest you don’t fall in love with men too easily. The Alpha Victor you speak of might be a treasure in your eyes, but to me, he’s nothing. And from the looks of your outfit, it seems like you’re the one playing the fragile little thing."

 Grace’s expression flickered. Just as I was enjoying the sight, two tears suddenly fell from her eyes.

 I was momentarily confused. Suddenly, a furious voice rang out from behind me. "Seraphina Bennett, when are you going to stop picking on the weak?"

 I turned around, and there he was—the annoying narcissist, Victor.

 He certainly looked good, but the moment he spoke, his arrogance, his belief that no one else mattered, made me want to slap myself. How could I have fallen for a guy like him? I must have been blind.

 "Victor, don’t blame Seraphina Bennett. It’s my fault for not being experienced enough, making her think I didn’t belong at this kind of event," Grace said, her voice trembling with false humility.

 Victor gently patted her shoulder in comfort.

 "Are you two done with your performance?" I asked, rolling my eyes. "This is a launch event, not a soap opera. Could you take it somewhere else and not disturb my work?"

 I brushed past them and joined Lily in the frenzied preparations for the event, though I couldn’t help but notice how Victor’s gaze lingered on me for a long time before he turned away.

 After a long day’s work, I glanced at my phone—still no unread messages from Alexander Stone.

 I was about to head out with Lily for a celebratory meal when Victor’s name popped up on the screen.

 Without a second thought, I hung up immediately. Lily gave me a silent thumbs-up for my action.

 Then, a series of messages popped up from him: "Seraphina, how dare you hang up on me?" "You better show up right now, or don’t expect me to talk to you again."

 I quickly typed a response: "Idiot."

 I thought for sure Victor would get the hint and stop bothering me.

 But no, more messages flooded in: "Seraphina, I’m drunk, come pick me up." "Aren’t you the one who likes me and wants to be my luna?" "I feel awful right now. Do I really need to beg you?"

 I stared at the screen, dumbfounded, and turned to Lily. "Is this guy crazy? Even lunatics don’t have mood swings this fast."

 "Seraphina, don’t tell me you’re softening up. You used to fall for his sweet words every time, like you were addicted to it."

 Lily looked worried. I patted my chest reassuringly. "Don’t worry. You know I’m not that kind of person."

 Just as I was about to block his number, a familiar photo appeared, followed by a short video.

 I tried to keep my anger in check and typed only two words: "Address."

 Then I turned to Lily. "Sorry, sweetie. I can’t go to dinner with you after all."

 Lily raised an eyebrow. "What’s going on? Dinner’s not a big deal, but you’re really going to meet Victor, aren’t you?"

 "Don’t worry. I’m just going to take care of one last thing. You go home and wait for me."

 With no time to explain further, I got in my car and sped toward the location Victor had sent me.

Chapter 3
A silver-gray Porsche stood out in the dark, its body slightly trembling.

 I walked up and knocked on the window. Victor’s eyes, filled with animalistic desire, slowly appeared.

 From below, Grace Miller’s breathless moan echoed, "Mmm… Victor… don’t stop."

 For a moment, my mind blurred. This scene felt eerily familiar.

 It was the same one when I had helped a drunken Victor and his girlfriend into the hotel.

 I had even kindly asked him if he needed condoms and offered to go buy some.

 Victor’s turquoise eyes held a mocking glint, and his hand, now in its wolf’s form, lightly patted my cheek. "Still my thoughtful Seraphina. Good girl, go close the door for me."

 I obediently stepped out, closed the door, and leaned against the wall.

 Soon, the same sounds I was hearing now echoed from the room.

 The feeling washed over me, as if time had bent back on itself.

 First came the slight ache in my heart, followed by tears I couldn’t control, then the familiar tender words and caresses that slowly filled my chest, pulling me deeper into the emotion.

 Victor’s eyes were full of anger. "Seraphina, this is the price you pay for being careless."

 My body began to tremble uncontrollably. Despite everything, even though I no longer liked Victor, I couldn’t stop feeling heartbroken.

 After what felt like an eternity, Alpha Alexander’s face suddenly appeared in my mind. I snapped back to reality and extended my hand. "Give me the necklace back."

 "If you want it, come take it."

 Victor straightened up and ran his hand over his powerful chest muscles. The necklace hung there, resting against his bare skin.

 I reached out, but he grabbed my wrist, holding it firmly against his chest. "You little bitch. Do you want me to fuck you, or do you just want the necklace?"

 My face burned with embarrassment, and I struggled to pull away but couldn’t break free.

 Victor pulled me even closer. "Don’t you remember how you begged me to wear it? You wanted me to have it."

 More memories flooded my mind.

 "Victor, Alexander and I went to the shrine to pray for this. It’s really powerful. If you wear it, it will keep you safe."

 I had held the pendant in front of him, kneeling beside his hospital bed.

 He had been in a car accident, his leg in a cast, unable to move.

 I’d taken out the necklace I’d worn for years, wanting to put it around his neck, but he had shoved me away. "Don’t make me wear your charms. It weakens me."

 "Just try it. It really works," I had begged.

 When we first moved to the small town, my health was frail, and I was always sick.

 Alpha Alexander had heard from his mother about the peace talisman at the shrine, and how it could protect someone. So, he went to pray there.

 He had knelt before the statue for five long hours, before he brought the pendant back and placed it around my neck.

 After that, my health had mysteriously improved.

 Victor had given in, eventually slipping the pendant under his pillow. "Alright, stop making noise. I need to rest. You’re giving me a headache."

 "Then sleep, and I’ll cook dinner for you."

 I had watched Victor take the necklace, then left, feeling satisfied.

 It wasn’t until later that Alexander found out about this and ignored me for two whole days.

 My heart ached again. Was I hurting for Victor or for Alexander?

 Grace Miller’s annoyed voice interrupted my thoughts. "Mr. Hale, focus. Don’t let these lowlifes distract you."

 "Give it back to me. You don’t deserve to wear it."

 I didn’t want to stay any longer. I just wanted to take the necklace and leave.

 "I don’t deserve it? And you do?" Victor casually pulled the necklace off, hanging it around Grace’s neck. He leaned down and kissed her. "It’s yours now."

 Grace scrunched her nose in distaste. "This broken stone... What’s so great about it?"

 "It is pretty broken," Victor sneered. "Next week’s your birthday, right? How about we celebrate at that fancy hotel?"

 "Yes, yes, I’d love that." Grace wiggled her exposed chest and moved closer to him.

 Victor smirked and added, "Come here and be our waitress. If you do a good job, I’ll return it to you."

 Those words were directed at me.

 I clenched my fists. Victor was just trying to reassert his dominance over me, now that I wasn’t obedient anymore. He wanted to remind me who was in charge.

 The necklace wasn’t the most important thing to me, not after seeing that video of him throwing it away. If it hadn’t been for that, I wouldn’t have come here.

 "You’d better keep your word."

 I turned and disappeared into the night, my revived memories reminding me that I had truly liked Victor before. But now, all I wanted was to apologize to the boy who had always been by my side.


Chapter 4
When I got home with a throbbing headache, Lily looked at me with concern.

 "Seraphina, is your head still hurting? Could it be the aftereffects of the concussion?"

 Lily gently massaged my temples, and I could feel my heart gradually calming down.

 "I’ve been thinking about something... Was I really that foolish in the past?"

 "How could pursuing someone you like be foolish? But Seraphina, don’t lose yourself in the process."

 I turned and wrapped my arms around Lily. "I miss Alpha Alexander. Why hasn’t he come back yet?"

 "Seraphina, sometimes I really envy you. You’re so brave when it comes to expressing your feelings. But me..."

 Lily trailed off, and I softly rubbed her back. "Once you know what you want, just go for it. That way, when you look back, you won’t have any regrets."

 Still, there was no reply from Alexander. I decided I would get the pendant back and go find him to apologize.

 On Grace's birthday, I showed up at the meeting on time.

 Given Victor’s usual attitude toward me, I expected him to treat me like a joke, humiliating me in front of everyone. But to my surprise, when I entered the private room, only Grace and a bunch of unfamiliar werewolves were there.

 "Where’s Victor?" I asked, confused.

 "Seraphina Bennett, Victor’s long since tired of your tricks. Your pathetic little stone’s here. Today, Alpha Victor gave me orders to teach you a lesson," Grace said, lounging in her chair with her legs crossed, chin resting on her hand. "For now, start by wiping my shoes. I got a little dust on them when I arrived."

 I didn’t say anything but stepped forward to grab a tissue and wipe the dust away.

 The others in the room jeered, "Grace, this servant’s actually pretty good-looking. Let’s have her drink with us later."

 "Are you all blind? What’s so special about her?" Grace scoffed, deliberately stepping her foot onto my shirt.

 "Don’t push it!" I took a step back.

 Grace sneered. "You can’t even handle this? Looks like this stone’s only good for being a stepping stone in my backyard."

 I took a deep breath, straightened my back, and kept wiping the shoes.

 "Enough. The only thing you’re good for is cleaning my shoes. Go pour drinks for my friends. Don’t you see they’ve been sitting here forever?"

 I served drinks, losing track of how many rounds I had poured. My stomach started to hurt again, and my head began to feel heavy, as if something was invading my thoughts.

 "Seraphina, can you hurry up?" That was Victor’s voice.

 "It’s fine, Seraphina, I’ll wait for you." That voice belonged to Alpha Alexander.

 I remembered the three of us climbing a mountain together. Back then, I was small, barely 5'3", struggling to keep up with Victor, who was 6'1".

 When we got home, there was a box of milk on my desk.

 Victor, with his usual cold expression, said, "Grow taller, so I don’t have to wait for you all the time."

 I grinned and immediately opened the bottle to drink.

 After school, I spent nearly an hour in the restroom before coming out.

 Alexander looked at me with worry. "You’re allergic to milk. You shouldn’t drink it."

 "It’s fine. Victor bought it. Besides, I’m too short; I need to grow taller."

 "You can grow without drinking milk. I’ll take you to the gym in the mornings from now on."

 "Really?" I was thrilled and threw my arms around Alexander, shouting, "Alexander, you’re the best."

 I’m allergic to milk, so I hardly ever drink it, and I rarely touch alcohol either.

 I still had some awareness left as I approached Grace. "Can I have the pendant back now?"

 Before I could finish, a wave of nausea hit me, and I vomited.

 "What are you doing?" Grace’s voice was shrill.

 I mumbled, still clutching the pendant. "Give it back to me."

 "Slut, do you have any idea how much this outfit costs?"

 A sharp slap struck my face, and the sting made me clutch onto Grace’s clothes even tighter. "Give it to me."

 The pendant was thrown at me, and I quickly grabbed it in my hand.

 "Such bad luck. You guys take care of her. I’m leaving."

 The sound of Grace’s high heels grew distant.

 I placed the pendant against my chest, but then I heard heavy breaths and wolves howling nearby. Hands began to roam over me.

 "Get off me! Alpha Alexander won’t let you hurt me."

 I yelled with all my might, but it only provoked their anger.

 "Ha, this slut’s got some fire."

 "BOSS, you go first, and when you’re done, let the rest of us have a turn."

 "Fine, but get her shirt off first…"

 My head felt heavier, and all I could hear was the chaotic noise around me.

 Clutching the pendant, I curled into myself, trying to defend as best as I could.

 In my mind, I kept repeating, "Alexander, you can’t ignore me this time."
