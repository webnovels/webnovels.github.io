My ex-fiancé Ethan Parker embezzled $3 million from my personal investment fund.

Even worse, I discovered he had been having an affair with his assistant Olivia Wilson for months, plotting to steal all my assets!

Four years of love turned out to be nothing but an elaborate scam!

"Where's my money?" I kicked open the door to his office.

"Oh, that," Ethan said casually. "Olivia's new project needed some startup capital, so I borrowed it temporarily."

"Borrowed? Is $3 million just pocket change to you?"

"Aren't we family? Why be so particular about money?" He had the audacity to act righteous.

"Family? Does family sleep with someone else behind your back?" I threw the hotel photos of him and Olivia on the desk.

Ethan's face turned pale, but he quickly regained composure. "There's nothing to explain. Olivia and I just have a work relationship."

"Does a work relationship require sharing a bed?"

Looking at this man I once loved deeply, anger boiled inside me like lava.

Four years of tenderness and care, all just an act!

He treated me like an ATM, using my love as a bargaining chip!
