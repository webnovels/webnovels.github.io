"My seven-year-old son, Mikey, got bit by a snake.

I rushed him straight to the hospital where my older son, Chris, works.

I didn't expect to be mistaken for Chris's mistress by his girlfriend.

She didn't just stop them from giving Mikey the anti-venom, she slapped me hard across the face.

""Chris and I are perfect for each other, and you waltz in here with his secret love child, trying to cause trouble?""

She threw me to the floor and started hitting me, then went even further, cutting off my womanhood, while telling me.

""A slut like you will learn to behave, after I seal you up forever.""

I was beaten to a pulp and rushed into the ER.

The doctor on call was Chris.

His hand shook as he held the scalpel.

His face was pale white.

""Mom, who did this to you?"""
