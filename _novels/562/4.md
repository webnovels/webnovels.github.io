It seems Tiffany was even more impatient than I'd imagined.

I looked down at Jason's handsome, sunny face and the dark circles slowly forming under his eyes. With a mix of pity and mockery, I lightly caressed his cheek before pushing him away.

"Did you work overtime today?"

"Yeah," Jason lied smoothly. "Uncle Ethan gave me so many tasks. I'm exhausted, baby. Give me a kiss..."

I ruthlessly pushed away his approaching face and stood up to turn off my computer. Jason's eyes filled with hurt.

"Aren't we getting married soon? Why are you being so cold, honey? Don't tell me you can resist my perfect body when it's right in front of you?"

"How could I?" I answered absent-mindedly. "Of course we'll get married, but have you proposed yet?"

Jason's eyes immediately lit up again. "I will! Of course I will!"

I smiled and patted his cheek lightly.

"Wash up before you come to bed."

Then I got up and went to the bedroom to sleep.

...

Jason moved quickly. He was the type to wag his tail and beg for praise after doing even a small good deed. Although he hadn't told me the date of the proposal, I'd already guessed based on his behavior.

Of course, I shouldn't be the only one who knew about this.

While out shopping, I "accidentally" told Tiffany about Jason's upcoming proposal.

"He's so silly, preparing everything in secret and thinking I don't know anything. But there are so many holes in his plan."

I smiled happily, pulling Tiffany close and "sincerely" sharing my joy with her. "Tiffany, I feel like he's the one for me. You can see how much Jason loves me, right?"

"Right," Tiffany nodded absent-mindedly, a hint of disdain flashing in her eyes.

On the day of the proposal, Jason tricked me into going to the venue under the pretense of meeting friends.

I carefully chose a white dress and opened my chat with Ethan, which so far only contained greetings.

"Uncle Ethan, I think Jason is going to propose to me today. I'm so happy!"

Ethan didn't reply, but that didn't stop me from sharing my joy. I sent him photos of the decorated venue, along with a smiling emoji.

As I expected, I waited until after 8 PM but Jason never showed up.

His phone was turned off. Heartbroken, I sat alone at the venue drinking a lot of alcohol. As I was preparing to leave, I accidentally twisted my ankle.

Crying, I called Jason. He finally answered.

"I'm so sorry, Aria. I had an urgent matter come up and couldn't make it. I promise I'll make it up to you when I'm done!"

"Jason, I've twisted my ankle... I can't move..."

Flashes of lightning crossed the summer night sky, and the rain started pouring down unexpectedly.

"Aria, find somewhere to take shelter from the rain. I'll send someone to pick you up!!"

The call was hurriedly ended. I stared at the black screen of my phone, my expression gradually turning cold.

After sitting in the rain for a long time, headlights finally flashed nearby. A car stopped not far away, and Ethan got out with an umbrella, stopping in front of me to shield me from the rain.

"Jason asked me to take you home."

"Uncle Ethan..." I started crying pitifully. "It hurts so much..."

Ethan frowned and bent down to check my ankle. The rain was getting heavier, so he had no choice but to pick me up and carry me to a nearby hotel to get a room first.

In the air-conditioned elevator, our two rain-soaked bodies were pressed tightly together. Ethan's burning body temperature enveloped me, and my face turned red and hot. I wasn't sure if it was the alcohol or desire affecting me.

After entering the room, Ethan set me down on the couch and got a towel to dry my hair.

My head softly leaned against his waist, and I was almost falling over on the couch. He bent down and caught me in one smooth motion.

I opened my eyes and looked at him hazily.

His face was very close to mine, so close that I could hear his breathing.

"Uncle Ethan, thank you..."

I drowsily moved closer.

"I like you so much..."

My cold lips slowly pressed against his. They were so hot and soft. My fingers trembled as I involuntarily grasped his hand.

Ethan's previously restrained hand somehow relaxed, interlacing our fingers...

In the heat of the moment, his hand unconsciously gripped my waist tightly.

I cried out in pain.

"Honey, be gentle..."

Ethan's eyes darkened, his voice hoarse: "What did you call me?"
