After returning home, while Jason was in the shower, I grabbed his phone and quickly found Ethan's contact information. I searched for the number on my own phone and sent a friend request.

I was about to turn off Jason's phone and put it back when it suddenly lit up with a new message.

"You were so sweet today. Make sure to hide the gift I left for you well - don't let Aria see it."

It was a message from Tiffany.

I raised an eyebrow, putting the phone down without reacting.

The next morning, Jason had already left for work by the time I woke up. He was interning at his family's company, with Ethan as his direct supervisor. He didn't dare be even a minute late.

I had the day off from the hospital, so after getting up I went to the supermarket to buy groceries. I spent the morning cooking and prepared two lunch boxes.

Then I drove to Jason's office.

Before leaving, I took a photo of the lunch boxes and sent it to Tiffany.

"Tiffany, I spent all morning making lunch for Jason. What do you think?"

Tiffany replied quickly.

"That lucky guy! He must be over the moon!"

I smirked, closed my phone, and drove off to the office.

One of those lunch boxes was indeed for Jason, but it wasn't made specially for him.

On the contrary, I needed Tiffany to help distract Jason, my little stumbling block.

Sure enough, when I arrived at the office, Jason's desk was empty. His computer was still warm - he'd left recently.

A helpful coworker nearby said, "Aria, Jason often goes to play games in Mr. Jiang's office. Why don't you check if he's there?"

Perfect.

I smiled and nodded, then knocked on Ethan's office door.

"Come in."

Ethan didn't look up until he sensed the person at the door seemed hesitant. Then he raised his head to look at me.

"Aria?"

"Uncle Ethan." I called out timidly, glancing around the office. "Is Jason not here?"

So she's looking for Jason.

Ethan lowered his eyes nonchalantly. "No."

"Can I wait for him here?" I asked carefully.

"You may."

I entered the office with the lunch boxes. "Uncle Ethan, have you eaten yet?"

Ethan continued writing, giving a soft "Mm" in response.

"I made lunch. I prepared a portion for you too, to apologize for my rudeness yesterday."

I placed one of the lunch boxes on the desk and turned to look at Ethan. "Do you have any foods you don't eat, Uncle Ethan? I cut the carrots into little dog shapes. They're really cute."

Ethan put away his documents and moved to sit on the couch. I opened the lunch box and pushed it in front of him.

"Try some."

Ethan took a few bites. Seeing me staring at him expectantly, he had no choice but to comment, "It tastes good."

"Thank you, Uncle Ethan. I'm glad you like it."

My gaze met his eyes. His eyes were very dark, with slightly downturned outer corners. As I looked at him, I glanced at the number above his head in my peripheral vision. It was still steadfastly at 1683. My heart began to pound like a drum.

"Uncle Ethan, your eyes are so beautiful."
