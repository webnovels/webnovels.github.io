I just found out I was pregnant. 
Then I found out my husband was cheating. 
But everyone in my life told me to forgive him.
My husband got on his knees and swore he'd never contact that woman again.
I swallowed my disgust and decided to forgive him this once.
But the trauma triggered severe depression and OCD.
From that day on, my husband had to disinfect everything he touched. 
If he wanted to touch my arm, he had to wear gloves.
Finally, when I complained about finding a single hair on the floor, he snapped.
He ripped off his protective gear and exploded.
"Enough! I cheated ONCE, and you're going to punish me forever? You're acting like a psycho!"
He deliberately trashed the house. Smashed plates. Kicked over the garbage can.
As I stood there looking at the mess, a sharp pain tore through my stomach. 
Blood began streaming down my legs.
And I felt... relieved.
"Derek, let's get divorced."

I couldn't let it go. The betrayal cut too deep.
Knowing that when I was just one month pregnant, he couldn't keep it in his pants. He had to screw his secretary.
The disgust wouldn't go away.
I tried. God, I tried. I tried to forget. Tried to listen to our families. Tried to be the forgiving wife.
But I couldn't.
Derek shoved the door open, grabbed his coat, and stormed out.
"I can't do this anymore. I'm a person too. You want a divorce? Fine. Let's divorce."
He couldn't even look at me. Didn't notice the blood pooling on the floor.
The contractions at five months hit hard. I collapsed, barely managing to call 91
