"Sis-in-law, you're finally here!"

"Lucas passed out, but we still can't find the bracelet. What should we do..."

I showed no emotion as I reached out to touch the pool.

The members-only high-end club had a temperature-controlled pool 365 days a year, but now the water felt as cold as ice.

Jack explained that the club's temperature control system had coincidentally malfunctioned.

I could see the malice hidden in his eyes.

I nodded slightly, having noticed the phone he kept clutching in his hand.

Before coming, I had already put on a swimsuit underneath.

After a few laps in the pool, I indeed found the bracelet near the drain.

But just as I retrieved the bracelet and was about to climb out, someone stepped on my hand.

I jerked my hand away in pain, and a figure screamed as they fell into the water.

Caught off guard, I was suddenly pushed underwater. Water rushed into my nose and mouth, nearly suffocating me.

Before I lost consciousness, I vaguely saw someone jump into the water, swimming in the opposite direction from me.

Perhaps it was my strong survival instinct, but at the last moment, I managed to grab onto the pool's edge.

As I surfaced, someone grabbed my arm and pulled me onto the deck.

Lucas was holding Bella in his arms. He slapped me across the face:

"Sophia, do you realize you almost killed Bella!"

"It's my fault the bracelet was lost, but why did you try to hurt Bella!"

I lay on the ground, coughing and retching. My ears were ringing so loudly that his angry words seemed distant.

Lucas handed Bella to Jack.

With red eyes, he grabbed my neck:

"Stop pretending. If anything happens to Bella today, I'll make you pay with your life!"

Seeing that I was still clutching the bracelet tightly, he snatched it away. I hugged his legs, sobbing and pleading through my coughs: "Please, don't!"

His expression was ice-cold:

"This is your punishment."

With a forceful tug, he broke the bracelet into two pieces.

"Lucas, don't blame Sophia. She was just embarrassed about what happened at the party and wanted to get back at me a little."

"We're both women, I can understand."

Lucas angrily threw the broken bracelet to the ground. He carefully picked up Bella:

"Don't defend her. You're just too kind-hearted."

The group hurriedly left. Jack took the opportunity to snap several photos of me.

He made a "98" gesture to someone nearby, and they both laughed so hard they could barely stand up straight.

I held the broken bracelet tightly to my chest, tears falling in large drops onto the floor.

All the hurt I had been holding back now burst forth like a flood breaking through a dam.

Let it hurt more, until all the love turns into hate.

Lucas, I will forget everything from the past.

Never, ever will I love you again!
