"Alright, alright." Master Johnson sounded very pleased on the other end. "Then you should let your boyfriend know. You love him so much."

Boyfriend?

Did Lucas ever truly consider himself my boyfriend?

"Master, I don't love him anymore."

In my mind's eye, I could still see Lucas sitting in the middle of that group, watching my embarrassing moment on the big screen with a carefree smile.

Those mockeries and pranks were like sharp knives stabbing into my heart.

Forced to play the fool for three years, now that I've woken up from this dream, I sobbed and said:

"I will never love him again."

It wasn't until I started packing that I realized just how many memories could accumulate in three years.

The most prominent Polaroid on the fridge was from the day we got together.

Lucas chose to confess his love on the eve of April Fool's Day.

He said he was afraid that if he waited any longer, I might take his sincerity as a joke.

When I nodded and he embraced me, it had just turned midnight.

So, were all those vows of love and eternity planned lies from the very beginning?

My phone buzzed. Someone in the group chat asked:

"Are we letting her off so easily today? There are only a few hours left until midnight. Shouldn't we play one more prank?"

"We'd have to lure her out first. We've already used the 'Lucas has a stomach hemorrhage' trick before."

"You've all seen that bracelet Lucas wears, right? The one Sophia gave him. Apparently, it was her mother's keepsake."

My hand holding the phone started to shake.

"Shit, you sent that to the wrong group!"

"Crap, Sophia's in this chat too."

After a series of message retractions, the group fell silent.

Ten minutes later, my phone rang. Jack frantically said:

"Sophia, come quickly! Lucas is in the swimming pool and won't come out because of some bracelet."

"None of us can persuade him. You're our only hope."

That bracelet had been passed down for generations in my family. My mother had put it on my wrist on her deathbed.

"Sophia, don't cry. This will keep you company in my place from now on."

I never intended to give the bracelet to Lucas.

It was Jack who said in front of everyone: "Lucas has given you so many luxury gifts, but you've never given him anything decent in return."

"Sophia, are you just playing with Lucas?"

I tried to explain, but I couldn't be heard over their jeering voices.

The truth was, I had given him quite a few gifts within my means.

But in Lucas's circle, even a keychain could cost thousands of dollars.

At that time, Lucas kept a stern face. It was Bella who spoke up, pointing at my wrist and saying the bracelet meant a lot to me.

"Why don't you give it to Lucas?"

"For a gift, the thought matters more than the price."

I stammered, "This is from my mom..."

Lucas's eyes, which had briefly lit up, suddenly darkened. He threw his wine glass to the ground.

Someone pushed me from behind.

I suddenly found myself kneeling in front of Lucas, allowing him to take the bracelet from my wrist.

...

When I got out of the car and returned to the banquet hall, I felt like my entire body had turned cold.

I hated myself so much.

Hated how weak and stupid I had been back then.

I regretted it so much.

Regretted being blinded by love and constantly lowering my standards.

Even though I knew this was another trap.

I had no choice but to come.
