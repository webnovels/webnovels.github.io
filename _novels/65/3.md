Stepping out of the Clubhouse, rain was falling.

The fine rain soaked me instantly.

Coldness seeped in, tears silently falling.

I called a familiar attorney, asking him to draft divorce papers.

I also scheduled an Abortion Procedure on my phone.

Returning home, I washed away the rain, opening Asher's computer.

The password was Adeline's birthday.

A folder on the desktop was like a sharp knife, piercing my heart.

Asher had meticulously kept every concert ticket of Adeline's.

He lied about business trips, attending every stop on her Tour.

Sitting front row, capturing her brightest moments.

Tears flowed uncontrollably.

I hated Asher and hated my own stupidity.

I never questioned his flimsy excuses.

Like a fool, I was played.

Leaving was my final dignity.

After the party, Asher and Adeline returned home together.

They stumbled into Adeline's room, not coming out all night.

I put on earplugs, forcing myself not to hear or think about what might happen in that room.

The next morning, I found Asher making breakfast.

In all our years of marriage, even when I had a 104-degree fever, he'd never cooked.

It was clear who this low-fat, loving breakfast was for.

Seeing me, he seemed to forget last night's unhappiness.

He came over to kiss me.

"Love, I was wrong last night. Let me make it up to you. You're kind, don't hold it against me."

His scent was steeped in Adeline's perfume.

I felt nauseous, pushing him away to retch into the trash can.

"Love, you're four or five months in. Why is the morning sickness still so bad?"

Asher knelt beside me, patting my back and offering water, overly attentive.

But all I felt was chilling disgust.

Once the truth was revealed, no amount of tenderness could mask the lies.

Adeline, in a lace nightgown, gracefully descended the stairs, placing Asher's Wedding Ring on the table.

"Asher, your ring was on my bed."

One night was enough for Nolan to be engulfed in Adeline's perfume. The intensity of the scent made me feel sick, and I pushed him away to retch into the trash can.

"Asher, I'm four or five months pregnant, yet my morning sickness persists," I muttered as Asher knelt beside me, patting my back and offering me water with genuine concern. But all I felt was a chilling emptiness inside.

Once the truth is unveiled, even the kindest gestures feel hollow.

Adeline descended the stairs in a lace nightgown, placing Asher's wedding ring on the dining table. "Asher, you left your ring in my bed," she said to him, but her eyes provocatively lingered on me.

I let out a dry laugh and slammed my water cup down over the ring with a loud clatter. Asher awkwardly explained, "Cora, please don't misunderstand... Adeline was scared of the thunder, so I stayed in her room to comfort her."

"Misunderstand? You're both married adults. Is it really appropriate to share a room?" I retorted.

"What's inappropriate?" Adeline smirked. "Asher and I grew up together. We are the closest to each other. What's the big deal about sharing a room?"

Asher added, "Yeah, Cora, don't be petty... we're family. Besides, I was just sitting by her bed to keep her company."

In the past, I might have believed their excuses. But now...

I really wanted to drag them to look in the mirror. Fresh red scratches on Asher's neck. Kiss marks on Adeline's chest and fingerprints on her thighs. Who's really being indecent here?

Using family ties as a cover to do despicable things.

I didn't argue anymore. I went upstairs, printed out the Divorce Agreement, and signed my name. The scheduled Abortion Procedure is tomorrow. After that, I will completely disappear.

Three's a crowd in love, let alone four.

Adeline flaunted the breakfast Asher made on Facebook. Nolan, who was on a business trip, was upset and called to argue. After hanging up, Adeline felt wronged and lay on Asher's lap, complaining.

Asher's expression turned cold. "That Nolan, not very capable, but quite the temper. The Fu family doesn't need him bossing around."

Adeline smiled sweetly and wrapped her arms around Asher's neck. "Yeah, he's so annoying! You're the best to me. How about I divorce him and become your wife?"

Asher was startled, pulling her arm down and helping her sit properly. "Don't say such things. I'm your uncle. If Cora hears, she'll overthink."

Seeing her pout in dissatisfaction, he coaxed her, "Alright, eat some dragon fruit."

Adeline arrogantly instructed, "I don't want those tiny black seeds. You have to pick them out for me."

Asher couldn't refuse her and indulgently agreed.

When I came downstairs for water, I saw Asher, who never lifted a finger, using tweezers to pick out each black seed for Adeline.

Seeing me, Asher casually asked, "Cora, what fruit do you want? I'll have Auntie wash it."

Before I could refuse, Adeline playfully nudged Asher with her toe. "You should personally wash it for your wife, or she'll think you favor me."

Asher always listened to Adeline, immediately getting up to go to the kitchen.

I never understood why Asher thought that after the Rocky Mountains incident and him taking my boyfriend, I should still welcome Adeline with open arms.

Now I finally understood.

It's because Asher never cared about the harm I suffered. His heart was always with Adeline.

With Asher gone, Adeline dropped her facade, quickly switching to another persona.

"Cora, weren't you always proud? Look at you now, as ridiculous as a toad."

She covered her mouth, snickering, deliberately showing off the pink diamond ring on her finger.

"You should recognize this ring, right? Asher bought it at an auction. There's only one in the world. Isn't it beautiful?"

Adeline's lips curled up, her tone full of bragging. She deliberately shook her hand to make the ring more conspicuous.

"Did Asher ever give you a ring? Is your wedding ring this flashy? Oh, I forgot, your finger was amputated. How could Asher give you a ring!"

My heart clenched tightly, as if being mercilessly squeezed. I tried to maintain composure but unconsciously hid my hand behind my back.

Adeline leaned forward, laughing provocatively.

"Cora, Nolan is so boring. How did you ever fall for him? If it weren't for competing with you, I wouldn't have seduced him..."

“Should I dump him and be with Asher? Oh, and you probably don't know, Asher and I aren't related by blood... Here's a secret only Asher and I know, we dated secretly for a long time, shared all our firsts..."

"Asher married you because he was afraid you'd expose the Rocky Mountains incident... You must be so angry now! But so what? It's been years, and you have no proof!"

"Cora, you're truly pathetic. The two men you loved both love me. You'll always be my defeated opponent."

My hand trembled slightly.

The hand hidden behind my back had already started recording as soon as Adeline opened her mouth.

My gaze fell on her smug face. I deliberately provoked her:

"So what? Whether Asher loves me or not, I'm the legitimate Mrs. Fu. And you? You'll always be his niece. If it weren't for my finger injury, you'd never become the Orchestra's Principal Violinist. You're just my replacement!"

Adeline's sore spot hit, she flew into a rage.

She stood up and slapped me hard.

She used all her strength, and my face quickly swelled red.

"You wretched woman! I hate your arrogant face! You think your hand froze and died in the Rocky Mountains, and you had to amputate it?"

"Haha! Let me tell you, your hand was fine! I whispered to Asher in bed, saying you always flaunted your skills in front of me. Asher didn't hesitate to vent for me, amputating your finger!"

Adeline's mockery cut into my nerves like a sharp knife.

Seeing her arrogant, mocking face, the fury buried deep in my heart could no longer be contained.

Like a long-restrained volcano, it erupted instantly.

I stepped forward, full of anger and disgust, and slapped her across the face.

Adeline's face was slapped to one side. She covered it with wide eyes, changing to a pitiful and incredulous expression.

"Aunt Cora, why did you suddenly hit me?"

I shook my numb hand but hadn't reacted yet.

A shadow rushed out from behind, knocking me aside.

My stomach hit the edge of the sofa hard, sending a sharp pain through me.

Asher's eyes were full of anger as he looked at me.

"Cora! Are you crazy!"

Adeline cried pitifully, sniffling as she explained:

"Asher, I don't know why Aunt Cora hit me. I just wanted to clear up the misunderstanding from back then. I meant to call for help after getting out. I just didn't explain it clearly..."

"Cora, apologize to Adeline! How many times have I told you, Adeline didn't do it on purpose! Why do you keep holding on!"

His gaze was fierce, looking at me with only cold contempt, not even bothering to disguise it.

I curled up on the sofa, clutching my belly, even though a bright red handprint was on my face.

Asher chose to ignore it.

I laughed coldly at him:

"Asher, I lost the most precious fingers of a violinist. Don't I deserve an explanation?"

Asher frowned, a hint of panic in his eyes.

"What explanation? It was frostbite. If the fingers weren't amputated, you'd lose your whole hand!"

Before I could speak, Adeline raised her hand to cling to his shoulder.

"Asher, my head hurts..."

Asher didn't spare me another glance, scooping Adeline up and anxiously heading out.

"Don't worry, Adeline, I'm taking you to the hospital!"

All I got was a parting line:

"Cora, if anything happens to Adeline, I won't forgive you."

Watching them leave, the pain surged like a tide, overwhelming me completely.

The world before me began to blur, my consciousness fading.

But I could still feel my baby slipping away inside me.

Maybe my child knew I didn't want her and chose to leave.

Tears flowed uncontrollably, sliding down my cheeks.

I called an ambulance for myself.

At this moment, all ties between me and Asher were completely severed.

The Abortion Procedure went smoothly.

After the procedure, I lay weakly on the hospital bed, listening to the nurses gossiping.

"Did you see that man with his niece? Over a slap, they did a full-body check-up and booked a whole floor of rooms."

"I saw them. The uncle and niece are so close. If not told, I'd think they were a couple."

I listened, indifferent, and called the nanny at home to give them all a break.

I also hired a team of organizers online to pack my belongings and donate them to charity.

As for the mementos and photos from my years with Asher, I asked them to destroy them all.

Changing into clean clothes sent by a brand, I rescheduled my flight, originally set for tomorrow night, and left the hospital.

In the elevator, I impulsively pressed the floor where Adeline stayed.

At the door of the only lit room, through the glass, I saw Adeline hugging Asher's neck, sobbing while kissing his chin, throat.

"Asher, please want me... You clearly love me. I'll stop being a Fu family daughter."

Asher dodged, looking hesitant.

As for the keepsakes and photos from my years with Asher, I asked for everything to be destroyed.

I changed into the clean clothes provided by the brand, rescheduled my flight originally planned for tomorrow night, and called a car to leave the hospital.

On an impulse, I pressed the button for the floor where Adeline was staying.

It was the only room with a light on at the end of the hallway.

Through the glass on the door, I saw Adeline clinging to Asher's neck, sobbing and repeatedly kissing his chin and throat.

"Asher, please, be with me... You clearly love me. If it comes to it, I won't be a daughter of the Fu family anymore..."

Asher looked evasive, his expression uncertain.

"Adeline, don't do this—aren't we fine the way we are now? Saying things like that would hurt Eldest Brother and Sister-in-Law, and I swore I'd make it up to Cora for a lifetime."

Adeline shook her head, crying.

"This isn't good at all! I'm no longer satisfied just being with you in secret..."

She took Asher's hand and placed it on her chest.

Asher tried to pull his hand away, but eventually couldn't resist. He tightened his fingers and leaned down to kiss her lips.

I touched my now flat stomach, feeling suffocated by the pain engulfing me.

I leaned against the wall and turned to leave.

Walking out of the hospital, I got into an Uber heading to the airport.

After sending one last email to Asher, I canceled my phone number and deleted all my social media accounts.
