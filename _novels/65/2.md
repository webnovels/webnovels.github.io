Asher wanted the driver to take me to the Clubhouse, while he went to the airport to pick up Adeline himself.

The guests had all arrived by the time they showed up.

I watched as Asher and Adeline held hands tightly, looking down at my own incomplete fingers.

Asher treated me well but never touched my hand.

I used to think he was avoiding making me feel self-conscious, but now I realized it was disdain.

Adeline wore a white gown, like a proud white swan.

She dragged Asher to me, her smile pure but her eyes challenging:

"Aunt Cora, Asher insisted on throwing such a grand party for me. You didn't stop him?"

I suppressed my emotions, barely managing a polite smile.

She never called Asher "Uncle," only affectionately "Asher."

Asher affectionately ruffled her hair.

"I just wanted to show off. I want everyone to know the world's best violinist is right at home!"

Others chimed in:

"Yes, indeed, a great artist! It's hard to get tickets to your Orchestra's concerts. Give us a taste of your art!"

Like a scene from a drama.

Even the ballroom lights seemed to focus on them.

Asher wore a gentle, proud smile.

He carefully led Adeline to the stage.

Standing in the center, he bent slightly, adjusting her violin with practiced ease.

As if he'd done it a thousand times before.

As the music played, guests whispered around me:

"Adeline truly deserves to be Principal Violinist, talented and beautiful! If she wasn't Mr. Fu's niece, I'd think she and Mr. Fu were meant to be. Don't know why Mr. Fu would marry that disabled wife of his."

"This Mrs. Fu was the original Orchestra Principal. A few years ago, she lost a couple of fingers; what a pity... Why would a man like Mr. Fu marry such a woman?"

"Maybe she's something in bed."

Their words pierced my ears, making me paler.

Over the years, I had grown immune to such irrelevant remarks.

But today, I felt uncomfortable.

Just as Adeline finished playing, applause erupted.

Asher hugged her tightly, pride evident in his eyes.

Unable to bear it, I grabbed my bag and left.

Asher, just offstage with Adeline, saw me and followed, grabbing my arm.

"Cora, where are you going?"

"I don't feel well. I want to go home."

I bit my lip, holding back my feelings of injustice.

Asher frowned, suppressing his temper:

"Cora, don't be unreasonable. This is the Fu family's event. Leaving now looks bad."

"I'm really not feeling well."

He turned dark, losing patience.

"If you want to leave, go. You're spoiled. I think you just feel sick seeing Adeline..."

He let go of me, turning back to the party.
