My world seemed to crumble all at once.

I never imagined that my proud and happy marriage had been built on lies from the very beginning.

What I thought was my lifeline, a true love by my side, was actually filled with deceit.

Suddenly, a sharp pain shot through my abdomen, the bond between mother and child.

Instinctively, I bit my incomplete hand, stifling a groan of pain.

In the office, Asher gently caressed Adeline's face in a family photo.

"Since my love can't be publicly declared, clearing obstacles for her is the only thing I can do. As for Cora... I'll ensure her life is comfortable, that should be enough..."

The assistant hesitated:

"Mr. Fu, you tricked Madam into believing her frostbitten hand needed amputation so that Miss Adeline could become Principal. Aren't you afraid Madam will leave if she finds out?"

Asher paused, then let out a mocking laugh.

"Then I'll keep it from her forever."

"Besides, where can a disabled person go if she leaves me? Once the child is born, she'll be even more bound to me."

The assistant looked uneasy: "But Miss Adeline and Mr. Nolan's actions on the Rocky Mountains were premeditated murder, and you're covering for her—"

"Enough!" Asher interrupted angrily.

"You're too bold! I don't want to hear this again! Adeline and I grew up together; I know her better than anyone. She wouldn't harm an ant, let alone intentionally hurt Cora."

"I've already sacrificed my life for her, what more does she need to be content with?"

The assistant sighed and took his leave.

"Mr. Fu, Madam doesn't know that Miss Adeline is not related to you by blood. She hasn't targeted Miss Adeline because she doesn't want to trouble you. She loves you deeply; don't wait until it's too late to regret it!"

Tears blurred my vision.

Despite my limited mobility, I managed to put on a nonchalant smile.

The assistant left awkwardly.

When Asher saw me at the door, his expression froze. He quickly got up and walked to my side.

"Cora, why are you here? How long have you been here? Why didn't you come in?"

His gaze fell on my incomplete hand, a flash of disgust crossing his face before he put his arm around my shoulder.

I quietly hid my hand in my sleeve.

"I just got here. I came to pick you up after my Prenatal Checkup."

"Don't push yourself next time. You're pregnant; what if you get bumped into while running around?"

He said, then pressed his lips to mine, kissing intently.

His lips were warm, but my heart was cold.

The truth poured over me, and I realized how laughable I was.

Caught in the web of his gentle lies, mistaking the bait he threw as love.

Asher helped me sit on the couch, offering my favorite snacks.

"By the way, Adeline is returning from her Tour soon. With Nolan gone and our Eldest Brother and Sister-in-Law on a World Tour, it's unsafe for her to be home alone. I wanted to discuss having her stay with us."

"I know you still have reservations about what happened back then. I've explained many times; Adeline was misled by Nolan. I know her true nature—"

"Mm, I know," I interrupted Asher, "We're family."

Asher seemed pleased, his smile more genuine.

"Tonight, I'm hosting a welcome party for Adeline at the Clubhouse. Everyone will be there. If you don't come, people will say you're not on good terms..."

I nodded perfunctorily.

Lowering my eyes to hide the bitterness and despair.
