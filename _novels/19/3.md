I looked at him, saying nothing.
He tried to reach out and support me, but I sidestepped away.
"Oh, sister-in-law is back."
My mother-in-law and Adeline Carter were already up, sitting at the table ready to eat.
That woman wore an emerald green dress and an expensive jade necklace, giving her an air of elegance.
"Who told you to wear my clothes, to go through my jewelry box?"
I was furious, slapping her across the face.
This was my favorite dress before I got pregnant. That jade necklace was a birthday gift from my dad, truly priceless.
"Take it off immediately, or I'll call the police for theft!"
I've never flaunted my status as the Thompson Corporation's heiress in front of them, letting them think I'm easy to bully.
Adeline was startled, hiding behind Jasper, explaining pitifully.
"I came in a rush, didn't bring clothes. Just borrowing yours, I'll return them..."
Her pitiful look made it seem like I was the one at fault.
When she moved in, she brought plenty of things, so it's impossible she didn't bring clothes.
She just wanted to disgust me.
My mother-in-law came over upon hearing the commotion, seeing Adeline looking like I'd bullied her terribly.
"It's just a dress, why make such a fuss?"
"Your clothes and jewelry could open a store. One more or less doesn't matter."
"Just pity her, let her wear it."
"Besides, she's your sister-in-law, don't be so petty."
Before, to respect his pride, I would always compromise on what he said.
Now I realize I've been too accommodating.
Just trying to make me sick.
My mother-in-law rushed over when she heard the commotion, seeing Adeline Carter putting on an act as if I had severely bullied her.
"It's just a piece of clothing, why make a fuss?"
"You have enough clothes and jewelry to fill a store. One more or less doesn't make a difference."
"Show some compassion and let her wear it."
"Besides, she's your sister-in-law. Don't be so stingy."
In the past, to save his pride, I would always give in a little.
Looking back now, I realize I was letting him walk all over me.
I ignored his words and turned to him, saying, "I've been sleeping deeply these days, but last night I didn’t sleep well. I woke up and didn't see you in the bedroom. Today, you're defending her so generously. Did you actually do something behind my back, like your mom suggested?"
My words clearly rattled the three of them.
My mother-in-law, who’s not accustomed to such situations, couldn't hide her panic.
Adeline Carter, who acts high and mighty thanks to my mother-in-law, even wrinkled my expensive dress.
Jasper Thompson was the quickest to recover. He was only caught off-guard for a moment before he replied smoothly.
"That's ridiculous, Nora. How could I do anything against you?"
"Last night, Mom had terrible back pain. I was giving her a massage for a while. You seemed to be sleeping soundly, so I didn't wake you."
"Isn't that right, Mom?" Jasper even shot a glance at his mother to back him up.
"Yes, yes, maybe I've been too tired from taking care of you lately. My back has been hurting."
What a joke. During their stay, the housekeeper has been preparing meals for their entire family, truly wearing herself out.
As for my mother-in-law, she wouldn’t lift a finger if she saw a bottle of oil toppled over.
I coldly watched their poor performance, feeling a wave of disgust rising up.
I quickly walked to the bathroom, unwilling to see their hypocritical faces any longer.
I had just finished a project and was ordered by my dad to rest at home.
As lunchtime approached, my mother-in-law insisted on going out to eat.
"Nora, eating this bland food with you every day is making me sick. Today, we're going out to eat."
"Jasper, take me and Adeline shopping at the mall. Buy more clothes and jewelry so others won’t think we're poor."
She even made a point to look my way as she said this.
I really didn’t want to stay with them, seeing their ugly faces.
Jasper looked at me, then at them, and finally spoke up.
"Nora, rest well at home. With the housekeeper taking care of you, I'm at ease."
Jasper ultimately chose them.
"Go if you want. Stop pretending here."
"Buy a few more clothes to change into. Don't keep taking others' clothes. That's what thieves do."
I retorted mercilessly.
My mother-in-law and Adeline Carter looked humiliated at my words, leaving with Little Rain without looking back.
Jasper raised his hand, but before he could speak, my mother-in-law pulled him out the door.
I watched them from the window.
Jasper was sandwiched between two women, holding a child’s hand, chatting warmly, as if they were the real family.
Ever since I got pregnant, everything seemed to change.
Did Jasper think that just because I was pregnant, he could easily control me?
He’s sorely mistaken.
Since he dared to provoke me, the entire Thompson family shouldn’t expect an easy time!
Since marrying Jasper Thompson, he had always treated me well.
Pregnant women are naturally sensitive. I easily noticed even the slightest change.
Today was supposed to be my prenatal check-up day.
I waited all morning for Jasper to bring it up.
As expected yet unexpected, he forgot.
Watching their car drive away, I called the housekeeper to go to the hospital.
The hospital wasn’t far. My primary doctor was a student of my dad’s, and also my old friend, Finn.
