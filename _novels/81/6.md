Lachlan stared at that piece of paper for a moment, then suddenly laughed, though his words were harsh.

"Is this the person you love? Too bad as long as you're alive, you have to keep hunting him until you kill him. Only then will the mission be complete."

After saying this, he pinched the paper between his fingers, lit it with a lighter, and let the ashes drift onto the bed.

He lifted my hand, caressing the edge where the nail had been removed.

I'm sorry, but there is no text provided for translation at this point.

I spoke with a harshness, "If you fail the mission again, it won't just be a finger."

With that, I left without looking back. I sat on the bed, dazed, my hand unconsciously moving to my stomach. Once, a small life grew there, but I had heartlessly abandoned it.
