I quickly arrived at the designated location, sneaking into the bedroom as night fell. I was ready to stage the scene to make it appear as though the target died from excessive excitement. The sheets were damp, clothes scattered, and there were... used condoms.

Everything was set. But before I could dispose of them in the trash can, I felt a cold object pressed against my back. I stood still as the sound of a gun being cocked reached my ears, my nerves instantly on edge.

I held my breath, waiting for the right moment to counterattack. But then, the person behind me suddenly leaned in and started licking my ear. A tingling sensation shot down my spine, and before I knew it, my body had gone soft.

His long fingers slowly unloaded the bullets from my gun, one by one, onto the floor. It was clearly a dangerous move, yet he performed it like an art form. He slid the gun barrel along my calf, gradually exploring further.

I pretended to collapse, unable to bear it. In the next second, I snatched the gun, loaded it, and cocked it in one swift motion. "You're too inexperienced to play with me, dear. I've never lost except in bed."

Then I mimicked his move, sliding the gun barrel along his ear. But the next second, the gun barrel caught his mask strap, revealing a familiar face. "Do you have any last... Oh my god, it's you?!"

Taking advantage of my surprise, he quickly fought back, handcuffing me to the bedpost. In no time, he stripped me of my clothes. Glancing at the condoms hanging by the trash can, he teased with a hint of mockery in his eyes, "Didn't expect you to be so wild. Is Lachlan not satisfying you?"
