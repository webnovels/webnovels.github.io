After a delightful week in bed with Lachlan, he finally unlocked the handcuffs from the bedpost. He pulled up his pants and adjusted his tie, returning to his polished appearance.

This marks the third year since Lachlan took me in. He has trained me into a lethal weapon. But at the same time, I am also his devoted partner in bed.

After our encounter, Lachlan casually tossed me a document folder. This mission was to eliminate a top assassin from the competition. Successfully completing it would allow the company to dominate the entire industry.

I opened the document folder, reviewed the details, and then burned it to ashes.
