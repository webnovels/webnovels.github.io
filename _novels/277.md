A car crash left my mom a widow, and me an orphan.

Later, my mom chose to remarry into a powerful family, and her stepson naturally became my husband.

But on our wedding night, Julian just bolted, refusing to even touch me.

Julian and his dad, Richard, were always so busy with their work, they barely paid attention to Mom or me.

Not until I saw Julian meeting up with his mistress, and then found his STD diagnosis, did I finally break.

I ran to my mom, tears streaming down my face.

"Julian's out partying non-stop, living a wild, debauched life! I just can't do this anymore."

To my surprise, Mom started crying even harder than I was.

"Richard... he's never gotten over his ex-wife, and he's cheating with the housekeeper! I can't reach him, not really. This life is even worse."

We looked at each other, and a sudden, shared smile blossomed on our faces.

Soon after, news quickly spread online that the wife of the Richardson Group's CEO and the wife of its President had both tragically died in a cliff accident.
