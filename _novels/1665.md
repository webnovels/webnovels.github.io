The day Damian Thorne became a mafia boss, I took the bullet meant for his heart.

A searing pain tore through my shoulder. Through the haze, I heard Damian say calmly, "Aria, I owe you for this. But I must give Seraphina a wedding."

I forced a bitter smile, handing him the divorce papers I'd already prepared.

He glanced at the document, then shook his head.

"You will still be my wife in name. But Seraphina will be moving in with me."

Seeing his unwavering resolve, I was too exhausted to argue anymore.

He seemed to have forgotten, though. Five years ago, when we went to file our marriage papers in Ireland, he was so drunk he could only scribble his name. 

Our marriage was never legally binding. It could end at any moment.


The blood on my shoulder kept flowing, a steady, silent leak.

Damian frowned and lifted me onto the sofa. 

I watched him stride off to find a doctor. Then I pulled out my phone and dialed a number I hadn't touched in years.

"Caleb," I said, my voice tight. "Does your promise from five years ago still count?"

"Aria. I've been waiting for you to call."

I hung up just as Damian led the doctor back in.

The physician cut away my blood-soaked sleeve, his face turning grim.

"She needs a transfusion now. If I recall, Mrs. Thorne is RH-negative?"

The nurse beside him breathed out in relief.

"Thank god Mr. Thorne stockpiles rare blood at the estate. Otherwise, this would have been fatal."

But Damian explained, "That blood is reserved for Seraphina. She's been frail since the accident."

I glanced at Seraphina, sitting in her wheelchair, encircled by bodyguards.

In five years of marriage, Damian had never assigned a single guard to me.

The day we returned from Ireland, he'd dropped me at an elite combat training facility instead. His message was clear.

"If you want to stand beside me, you have to learn to stand on your own first."

The blood entering my veins felt like ice water, chilling me to the core.

When it was over, the doctor offered his final note.

"Mrs. Thorne is stable, but she requires complete rest."

Damian leaned in, taking my hand. His eyes held no warmth.

"You can't rest yet. You need to introduce Seraphina to everyone first. I won't have her seen as my mistress. I won't allow her to be disrespected."

Next to the matter of Seraphina Vance's reputation, my injury seemed irrelevant.

I gave a bitter, almost imperceptible smile.

"Then sign the divorce papers."

Our marriage held no legal weight, but the assets we'd accumulated did. They needed to be divided.

Damian's face tightened with impatience.

"Don't be absurd, Aria. Seraphina caught a chill yesterday. She needs to rest. She can't wait for you to be ready."

I smiled.

"Fine, I'll go."

I stood up from the sofa.

"Damian, you know I'm crazy. The second I get near that bitch, I might just lose it and kill her on the spot!"

With that, I turned on my heel and strode towards the crowd without looking back.
