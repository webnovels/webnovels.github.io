The scar that had been with me for 13 years was gone.

Tears burst forth.

Opening the diary again, I saw several more lines had appeared, but this time they were crooked, as if I could see the weakness of the person writing.

"Adrian, I saved you."

After calming down, I calmly replied with one sentence.

"This is what you should have done."

If it weren't for her 'like'.

If it weren't for her 'like' that she would inevitably betray in the future.

How would I have been targeted by Marcus, losing my dignity as a man?

Yet at 30, she had a child with the mastermind who hurt me, hurting me again.

The words in the diary appeared staggeringly, the strokes not very clear, as if written with great effort.

"Adrian, I'm willing to do anything for you, tell me what else you need me to do?"

After 17-year-old Lily wrote down the last question mark, I replied, "I've already said, leave my life."

"Completely disappear from my sight, don't use your love now as a weapon to hurt me in the future."

Once, when everyone mocked me for not being a man, it was Lily who firmly held my hand, gently soothing my shattered self-esteem.

It was because of her love that I was not afraid of any mockery, ridicule, or vicious curses.

So when she let go of my hand and stood among those who mocked me, I was instantly on the verge of collapse, even considering ending my life.

It turns out that being hurt by the one you love is a thousand times more painful than physical disability.

You could say, the more she loved me before, the more pain she caused me later.

This heart of mine, already hurt by her, will no longer beat.

The sound of forceful writing suddenly came through, each word sinking into the paper, almost piercing through it.

"That's impossible!"

"Adrian, do you know? Every time there's an extracurricular activity, you always like to stand under the second basketball hoop on the playground to play ball. I deliberately take a 5-minute detour every day just to see you once. Just seeing you makes me feel so happy."

"Once during a basketball game, I heard you were injured. I was so anxious that I skipped class for the first time to buy medicine for you, afraid you'd suffer for even a second more..."

"And..."

I interrupted, "I know, I know all of this you're saying."

"There was also once... when I fell in the bathroom, you brought me medicine, blushing."

The diary suddenly paused for ten seconds before replying, "You know all this? How do you know?"

"Since you know everything, why do you say I'll betray you?"

There was a sentence she didn't write, but I'm sure I know she was muttering to herself, how could I betray you when I love you so much.

I could imagine the shock and confusion on 17-year-old Lily's face right now.

"I know these things because the future you told me. You told me everything one by one, and said you deeply regretted doing these things."

Lily had said that she should have listened to advice back then and not married a man like me who couldn't give her "happiness", resulting in her enduring five years of humiliation.

She had also said that she should have just let me starve to death back then, saving me too early led to me not only being ungrateful for her great kindness but even becoming more and more arrogant.

She always boasted about her "great achievements", and then did whatever she wanted in our marriage, until now having a child with someone else.

Tears fell on the diary, blurring the words.

Afraid of damaging the diary and not being able to change the past, I hurriedly tried to wipe it off, but I used too much force and accidentally tore the paper in half.

In my panic, I suddenly found that everything in front of me had changed into a hospital ward.

In front of me was a 17-year-old girl with thick bandages wrapped around her abdomen.

Her face was pale, her brows furrowed in pain from the wound.

17-year-old Lily covered the blood-stained bandage with one hand, struggling to write a reply with the other, muttering under her breath.

"Adrian, don't worry, I'll take good care of you until I become your wife..."

She looked serious and determined, as if doing something of utmost importance.

Just as she wrote this, 17-year-old Lily seemed to sense something.

Her hand suddenly stopped, and when she looked up, our eyes met.

"Adrian?"

At that moment, those clear eyes like spring water, which had long disappeared from my memory, appeared in front of me again.

Her slightly dry lips parted, but before she could speak, a sudden burst of phone ringing came through.

Looking around, I saw the house was in a mess.

All done by 30-year-old Lily.

The phone rang sharply.

It was a call from 30-year-old Lily, her tone commanding, "Come to the coffee shop downstairs from the company right away, Marcus and I have something to tell you in person."

At the same time, several lines appeared in the diary.

"Trust me, okay? I would never do such a thing."

"I like you so much that even if you want to take my life, you can."

A girl's affection, as pure and beautiful as cherry blossoms.

Always feeling that vows would become the most beautiful flowers, as long as they stayed by their loved one's side, they would never wither.

I gripped the pen tightly in my hand, my eyes downcast.

Fine.

Since you don't believe me, I'll let 30-year-old you tell you yourself.
