For ten years, I was Jack's secret lover, and during that time, I secretly gave birth to a child.
In those days when I sought neither fame nor fortune, Lucas was my only salvation.
Later, Jack found out about Lucas's existence and said he wanted to give the child a family. I was moved to tears.
Until that day, I saw Olivia, his first love who had disappeared for ten years, getting out of his car with a child.
"Jack, are you sure that child can save Lily?"
"Of course! I made her have my child to save Lily!"
"I've been secretly monitoring his health condition, and all the test results are good! The doctor said as long as the bone marrow matches, Lily can live!"
What I thought was stolen happiness turned out to be an elaborately designed scam.
That night, I dialed a number I had never called before: "Can Lucas and I become your legal family?"
