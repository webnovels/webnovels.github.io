On February 14, 2006, Rachel married Jake, who was three years her junior. Jake's parents, still strongly opposed to the marriage, didn't attend the wedding. The newlyweds moved into Rachel's house. Jake was an excellent stepfather to Lily, often doing more than Rachel herself in caring for the child.

A year later, Rachel gave birth to their son, Kevin. While Kevin's arrival brought joy, it also increased their financial burden. Rachel, overwhelmed with childcare, temporarily leased out her restaurant, leaving Jake as the sole breadwinner.

Unfortunately, Jake's company faced a crisis when two employees died in a work accident, resulting in hefty compensation claims. To make matters worse, Rachel developed mild postpartum depression, often lashing out at Jake and the children. Jake had no choice but to ask Rachel's mother, Linda, for help. With her support, Rachel's condition gradually improved.

Feeling the weight of financial pressure, Jake desperately sought a higher-paying job but was repeatedly turned down due to his lack of qualifications. One day, while pondering how to make money amid piles of steel pipes at his worksite, an idea struck him – he decided to sell the pipes illegally.

Knowing the high demand for steel pipes at construction sites, Jake thought he could siphon off a small amount without anyone noticing and sell them for a good price. On his night shift, he arranged for a scrap dealer to help him transport the pipes. Unfortunately, they were caught by a site worker who had forgotten something. The construction company reported the theft, and Jake was sentenced to one year in prison for embezzlement, along with a $5,000 fine.

During Jake's imprisonment, his parents, upon learning of the situation, came to Rachel's house and caused a scene. They didn't even inquire about their newborn grandson or visit Jake. Instead, they berated Rachel, calling her a seductress who had bewitched their son into marriage and now caused his imprisonment. They demanded $30,000 in compensation from Rachel. She scraped together the money to send them away, then broke down crying in her mother's arms, lamenting her misfortune and Jake's poor choices.
