Chloe stood in the middle of the plaza, my photo glaring from the giant screen behind her.

"Serena Hayes, you're a beauty influencer with millions of followers. You make tens of thousands of dollars from a single video. But that seventy-five thousand dollars is all I have! Please, just give it back to me!"

"If I hadn't trusted you so much, if we weren't best friends, how could I have possibly been scammed out of seventy-five thousand dollars?"

"Serena, you spend thousands on an outfit. But this seventy-five thousand dollars? I slaved away for years to save it! My parents are counting on that money for their medical bills and retirement! I'll do anything for you, be your slave, just give me my money back!"

Chloe sobbed, tears streaming down her face, her forehead hitting the ground with loud thuds.

Onlookers whipped out their phones, some snapping photos, others starting live streams.

"What's going on? Serena scammed her friend?"

"Are all influencers this heartless? She makes thousands so easily, but she'll still rip off her friend's life savings?"

"No one would beg like this in public unless they were truly desperate. Serena definitely stole the money."

"Influencers like her should be blacklisted! She's a menace to society. I'm embarrassed to even say I live in the same city as her."

"She's just standing there, watching her friend bow and scrape, not even a word of comfort. See? Only the shameless ones get rich these days."

Suddenly, a guy, a male fan, charged at me, pointing his finger right in my face. "Serena Hayes, you scammer, pay her back!"

The scene erupted into chaos, many people shouting, "Pay her back!"

I calmly pulled out my phone and dialed the police.

At the same time, I raised my voice. "Chloe, I truly sympathize with you for falling victim to a deepfake scam. What you should be doing right now is reporting it to the police; maybe you can recover some of your losses. I've already called 911 for you."

Chloe shrieked, "That account *was* yours! It had your voice, your videos, even private details only you and I knew! You're the one who scammed me! You just don't want to pay me back, do you?"

I turned to the police officers who had just arrived, shaking my head regretfully.

"She's very agitated right now. I'm worried she might be susceptible to further scams."

"You're still lying!" Chloe suddenly lunged at me, slapping me across the face.

"Serena, you must have scammed so many people! I have proof! It was you!"

"You make so much money off your fans, why would you still steal my hard-earned cash? You're shameless!"

Chloe hurled insults, trying to hit me again.

The police officers quickly intervened, restraining her.

I touched my stinging cheek, tears welling in my eyes.

I slowly turned, making sure every camera angle caught my vulnerable, pathetic expression.

Just then, my brother, Caleb Hayes, rushed onto the scene.

Caleb didn't even glance at me, immediately launching into an accusation.

"What is wrong with you? It's just seventy-five thousand dollars! Just give it back to Chloe and this whole thing is over. Now everyone knows, have you even considered the impact on your image?"

"Chloe lives so frugally, unlike you. You rake in tens of thousands from one ad deal."

"You make money so easily, you should be more understanding of your friend's struggles. Don't you agree?"
