Ethan and Jack watched as my body was corroded by the acid, emitting wisps of white smoke. They finally furrowed their brows in discomfort, but only for a moment. Right now, Olivia's safety was more important than this unknown female corpse.

Jack took a few photos and sent them to the kidnapper. "We've done what you asked. The police won't be able to trace this back to you. Now release Olivia!"

My soul hovered in the air, watching as the lump of flesh Ethan had cut from my abdomen was consumed by flames.

That was my child with Jack!

He was so tiny, not even given the chance to come into this world and see his parents.

Yet he was cut out and carelessly tossed aside by his own uncle, then burned to ashes by his own father.

I floated over, desperately trying to save him from the flames, but my body passed right through him. Only the flames flickered slightly.

Why?!

Today was my birthday. I had planned to share the happy news of my pregnancy with the two most important people in my life tonight.

But today was also Olivia's birthday.

Ethan and Jack had spent the entire day with Olivia, shopping with her, taking her to the amusement park.

At noon, Jack had messaged me to come to the amusement park, saying he and Ethan had rented out the whole place to celebrate my birthday.

I was overjoyed.

I first met Jack at an amusement park. It was also at an amusement park where my long-lost brother Ethan recognized me and brought me back to the Collins family.

In the first two years after I returned to the Collins family, Ethan and Jack were quite nice to me. Though I couldn't compare to Olivia's status in their hearts, they did pamper me to some extent.

For the first time, I tasted what it was like to be loved.

Until two years ago, when Olivia voluntarily suggested giving her birthday back to me, changing hers to the next day.

She said, "Big sister Aria shares the same birthday as me every year. She must feel sad about it. I'll give the birthday back to her. As long as big sister Aria is happy, I don't mind not celebrating my own birthday!"

Though Ethan and Jack didn't refuse Olivia's suggestion, their attitude towards me changed dramatically after that.

My brother never again called me "Ari" affectionately. Instead, he addressed me coldly as "Aria Collins."

Jack also stopped holding me close every night, whispering sweet nothings about wanting me to bear him a daughter.

He used to say he loved daughters, and wanted one as cute as me, with a smile as bright and beautiful.

Now, all that remained were the nights when he was drunk, roughly throwing me onto the bed to forcefully satisfy his desires.

But on my way to the amusement park, I was drugged and kidnapped, then tortured to death.

At that time, Ethan was stopping Olivia from eating ice cream during her period, while Jack was queuing to buy her rainbow cotton candy.

"Once I receive the ten million dollars, I'll naturally release this woman!" The kidnapper's tone was arrogant.

"You'd better not try any clever tricks. Otherwise, this woman will end up just like that corpse!"

Ethan nervously said, "The money is ready. Don't touch her!"

Ethan and Jack exchanged a glance before hurriedly leaving.

As they reached the door, something caught Ethan's attention under his feet.

He bent down to pick it up. It was a wedding ring, the one I wore every day and never took off.

Jack frowned, wondering why Aria's ring would be here.

He looked back at the unrecognizable corpse in the warehouse.

Ethan interrupted Jack's train of thought: "Let's go quickly. If we're late, Olivia will be scared!"

Jack nodded, pocketing the ring and hurrying to catch up.

Saving Olivia was more important right now.

I floated behind them, unable to help but mock myself. In their hearts, Olivia was indeed still the most important person.
