Thud!

Daisy's head hit the ground, and instantly, blood welled up.

"It hurts so much! Mom!"

Daisy wailed.

Watching her forehead swell rapidly, my heart ached.

I quickly knelt down, gathered Daisy into my arms, and gently comforted her: "It's okay, Daisy, Mom will make it feel better."

"David! How could you?! Why would you hit a child so hard?!"

Mom's eyes flashed with resentment.

For the past three years, Daisy had been her precious little girl.

She'd rather starve than let Daisy go without, always giving her the last potato.

Now seeing her granddaughter injured, a flicker of anger ignited towards her son, who hadn't returned home in so long.

"David, who *are* these people?"

The woman sashayed over to us, her eyes openly contemptuous.

I looked up at her.

She wore a designer dress, the form-fitting waistline accentuating her perfect figure.

Her makeup was exquisite, her hair fashionably curled, and a faint sweet scent wafted from her.

As for the white heels she wore, I'd seen them in town—they cost a fortune, easily twenty dollars.

Then I looked at myself: a faded, patched, and worn old dress, my canvas shoes torn at the front, my big toe peeking through.

My sun-baked face was covered in burn marks.

No wonder... David hadn't wanted to come home in three years.

With a beauty like her by his side, he probably long forgot about his long-suffering wife.

"Leah, what are you doing here?"

David looked a bit awkward.

"I was just heading to the daycare to pick up Leo."

Then, she pointedly glanced at me: "Aren't you going to introduce us, David?"

"This is... my mother, my daughter, and... my wife."

David's voice grew softer with each word, the last two barely a whisper.

Hearing this, Leah's face stiffened, a flicker of displeasure flashing in her eyes.

"Audrey, this is Captain Miller's widow, whom I'm looking after."

David looked at me.

But I didn't respond.

I'd known who she was all along.

In my last life, after David forced me to divorce, he turned around and threw a city-wide sensational wedding with Leah Stewart.

Leah, adorned in an expensive Western-style wedding gown, dripping in gold rings, earrings, and necklaces, shone like a movie star.

Meanwhile, I was barely clothed, collapsing on the street after three days without food.

How could I forget her?

"Mrs. Miller, why didn't you notify us you were coming?"

Leah spoke politely, as if she were the lady of the house, exchanging pleasantries.

A sarcastic smile touched my lips.

"Do I need to notify someone to visit my husband?"

"And please, don't call me 'Mrs. Miller'. What if those guards over there misunderstand?"

Hearing this, Leah's face turned grim.

Seeing her expression, David quickly explained: "Audrey, you know military regulations are pretty strict. Only official family members can live on base."

"That's why I asked Leah to pretend to be my wife. But we're completely innocent, you have to believe me."

"That's right, Mrs. Miller. It's thanks to David's help all these years. I truly don't know how to thank your family enough."

Watching their sickening charade, my stomach churned. I was utterly disgusted.

I really didn't want to say another word to Leah.

I looked at David, my voice cold: "Daisy's head is bleeding. Take us to the base clinic to get it bandaged now."

"But..." David looked hesitant.

"What's wrong? You can't even do this small thing?" I was getting angry.

Leah, seeing my frustration, smiled sweetly and pulled David behind her: "Mrs. Miller, let me explain this to you."
