My flight was going down. In those final moments of despair, the flight attendants announced that signal service had been restored.

I didn't call my boyfriend, Ethan.

Instead, I stared at the group chat. It was flooded with screenshots of Ethan begging Lily to change her flight.

Ethan, usually so cold and composed, sounded desperate in his texts.

[Lily, I can't lose you. Please change your ticket. Please?]

I watched their conversation tick past 999+ messages. I closed my eyes and dialed my best friend, Sarah.

"Sarah, the plane is going down. I'll watch over you from up there. Have a happy life."

I hung up amidst her agonizing screams.

I transferred every cent in my bank account to her.

The chocolate I’d bought for my marriage proposal to Ethan shattered in the roar of the explosion, turning to ash along with me.

Ethan didn't know. The seat he begged Lily to give up... she gave it to me.

Chapter 1

My soul floated in mid-air, looking down at the scorched earth.

The roar of the explosion still echoed in my ears.

In the blink of an eye, I was transported to the arrivals hall where Ethan was picking up Lily.

She threw herself into Ethan’s arms, tears streaming down her face. Her long lashes cast shadows on her cheeks, her voice soft and trembling. "Ethan, your premonition was real. Thank God I listened to you."

"Ethan, you almost lost me." Her voice broke as she buried her face deeper into his chest.

Ethan held her tight, his trembling hands soothing her back, celebrating his beloved's survival.

After a long while, she looked up from his embrace. "It’s such a pity I missed your birthday. I’ll make it up to you."

Ethan’s voice was choked with emotion. "It doesn't matter. I’m lucky enough just to have you."

Lily’s fans were moved to tears, raising their phones to capture this "beautiful" moment.

They were ecstatic that their goddess had returned safely.

And they sighed in sympathy for the tragedy of the previous flight.

Reporters, who had been waiting, rushed forward. "Miss Lily, we heard you changed your flight because of Mr. Sterling's sixth sense. Can you tell us more?"

She pulled away from Ethan’s embrace and looped her arm through his.

"I was originally booked on the previous flight so I could celebrate Ethan's birthday. But he insisted he had a nightmare, an omen, and begged me to change it."

"He sent over 999+ messages. Seeing him so worried, I decided better safe than sorry. I never expected this to happen. A moment of silence for the victims. May they rest in peace."

She bowed to the cameras.

Then she showed a screenshot of Ethan’s messages.

[Lily, I can't lose you. Change the ticket, okay?]

[Please, just listen to me.]

The fan groups went wild online.

"My goddess Lily is so kind. Thank fate for letting us keep her. RIP to the victims."

"So CEO Sterling is basically Lily’s savior? OMG, marry him! Marry him!"

"The Universe is literally forcing them together. It would be a crime if they don't date."

The reporter extended the microphone to Ethan.

He usually hated speaking to the media, but this time, his answer was incredibly earnest.

"I thank God, I thank my parents looking down from heaven, I thank my intuition, and I thank Lily for listening. This is the best birthday gift I’ve ever received."

A passerby walked past. "Who's that? Oh, Ethan Sterling from Sterling Corp. But I thought his girlfriend was named Maya? Weird, maybe I remembered wrong."

No one pays attention to the voice of a passerby.

Just like me—just a passerby on their road to romance.

Perhaps due to my lingering obsession, my soul was tethered to Ethan’s side.

When the crowd dispersed, his assistant walked up and asked quietly, "Mr. Sterling, do we still need to wait for Miss Maya?"

His eyes froze for a second, as if he had just remembered me.

Right. I was supposed to be on this flight too—the safe one.

He checked his phone. No calls, no texts. A hint of anger surfaced on his calm face.

Lily chimed in at the perfect moment. "Did my sister not mark herself safe? Oh, that’s so worrying."

Hearing this, Ethan put away the phone he was about to use to call me. "She’s always been immature. I’ve spoiled her too much. It’s time she learned a lesson. Let’s go."

He opened the car door for Lily, hand guarding her head, fixed her dress, and helped her in.

Lily turned back with an apologetic face. "Ethan, is Maya upset because she saw you picking me up?"

"Maybe I should call and apologize. I feel terrible making her misunderstand."

Ethan’s thin lips pressed into a line. After a moment, he spat out one word. "Fine."

Surprise flashed across Lily’s face, quickly replaced by hidden resentment.

Listening to the airport news broadcast, she seemed to remember something and quickly dialed my number.

Naturally, it didn't connect.

When she tried to redial, Ethan spoke coldly. "Forget it. She’s throwing a tantrum. It has nothing to do with you."

He ordered the driver to move.

I looked for even a trace of worry on his face.

But I found nothing.

Chapter 2

It was expected. You get used to disappointment eventually.

Just like he got used to "teaching me lessons."

He never understood that pain always hurts, no matter how many times you feel it.

Ethan had forgotten that to teach me a lesson, he had already blocked my number.

That’s why I couldn't get through to him on the plane.

Being with him meant constant "lessons."

If I delayed him buying a gift for Lily, I needed a lesson.

If I made him late for Lily’s show, I needed a lesson.

If I didn't like him going to care for a sick Lily in the middle of the night, I needed a lesson.

If I stopped Lily from cutting a rose from my Valentine's bouquet, I needed a lesson.

If I refused to give my cat to Lily, I needed a lesson.

Teachers used to say if you learn your lesson, you get a reward.

But they never said how many lessons it takes to be "good."

My reward never came.

Now, death was my final lesson.

Ethan took Lily back to his villa.

There was a permanent room for Lily there.

Lily was the Sterling family's foster daughter.

Later, she found her biological mother—my stepmother.

Lily left the Sterling family without hesitation and became my father's stepdaughter.

All because her feelings for her "brother" Ethan weren't just sisterly.

But Ethan didn't see it that way.

He thought she left to repay her birth mother, while still honoring her foster parents and loving her brother. To him, she was loyal and grateful.

Plus, since we were now step-sisters, we should get along.

I met Ethan in college.

I once asked him, if he had feelings for Lily, we should break up. I didn't want to be the villain.

He didn't even hesitate. He told me it was purely sibling affection. Lily was just a bit clingy because she was spoiled.

His eyes were so certain.

Even now, as Lily walked out of the shower in a sheer, ultra-short silk nightgown, braless, carrying a glass of warm milk into his study, he didn't suspect this "sibling" bond had rotted.

Before Lily could speak, the doorbell rang.

It was Ethan’s childhood friend, Caleb. He started teasing immediately.

"Look at you, the Great Prophet."

"We should market this. You'd go viral."

"Telepathy between lovers, snatching your girl from the Grim Reaper. So romantic."

Ethan frowned, his dark eyes disapproving.

"Stop talking nonsense. I just had the same nightmare I had when my parents died. I thought of Lily. It’s not that deep."

He emphasized, "Besides, my conscience is clear. We are just siblings."

Caleb looked at him like he was an idiot. "Bro, that's the excuse you use to trick Maya. Don't try to gaslight your best friend."

The air went silent.

Caleb straightened up, looking incredulous. "You... you gaslighted yourself?"

He grabbed Ethan’s left hand, revealing his wrist.

A glittery hair tie was wrapped around it.

"You're wearing Lily’s hair tie and telling me you're just siblings?!"

Ethan denied it instantly. "This is Maya's."

Caleb sighed. He tried to find the Instagram Story Lily had posted.

I knew the one.

It was the day of my girls' night out. Spouses were invited.

Ethan bailed on me because Lily had a performance, and as her "brother," he had to be there.

That night, Lily posted a photo of Ethan’s hand wearing that hair tie. Caption: [Thanks for satisfying my possessiveness.]

She deleted it quickly.

I knew she posted it just for me to see.

Chapter 3

Caleb couldn't find the post, but he said firmly, "If you don't believe me, ask Lily."

Ethan was unwavering. "There must be a misunderstanding. Lily and I are family."

Caleb patted his shoulder, looking disappointed. "You are hopeless. If Maya doesn't leave you, it’s because you saved the world in a past life."

Hearing "leave," Ethan looked like he heard something terrifying. "Impossible."

Caleb shook his head, took Ethan’s phone, and found a fan-edit of the airport reunion.

"Bro, watch this. If you still want to be with Maya, figure out how to explain this."

He scrolled through comments like "Marry immediately" and "Destiny." His face darkened.

See? I wasn't the only one who thought they crossed the line.

Ethan sounded confident, but after Caleb left, he was restless.

He unlocked a sandalwood box and took out a carefully wrapped package.

I was curious. When he opened it, it was a ceramic cup I had given him.

Wait. It wasn't the cup I gave him. The box was mine—it had my handwriting—but the cup inside was different.

I gave him an ice-crackle glaze cup. This one had gold wire inlay.

Ethan held the cup carefully, wiping it with a soft cloth.

I saw a jade earring in his treasure box too. It looked like the one I lost.

He locked everything back up.

His emotions settled.

He stood there for a moment, then walked toward my room.

It was a guest room, but since I stayed over occasionally, it was practically mine.

Someone was inside. Lily.

Seeing Ethan enter, she explained nervously, "My room hasn't been cleaned in ages, so I wanted to use Maya's room for a bit."

But I saw she had thrown away everything that belonged to me.

There was no trace of me left.

Ethan noticed nothing.

He paused, seemingly displeased, but his tone remained gentle. "Don't take the internet comments seriously. Mom and Dad are gone; I don't want to lose any more family."

Lily’s eyes turned red. "Ethan, I understand. I'll stay by your side forever."

Ethan found nothing wrong with this. He closed the door for her.

He missed the look of desperate obsession in Lily’s eyes.

I followed Ethan back to his room.

I didn't want to sleep in his bed, so I curled up on the chaise lounge.

I drifted into a dream.

It was the Summer Carnival. Lily snatched the prize I won—a lantern—and ran toward Ethan. I stood under a pear tree, watching them drift further and further away.

"Don't go."

I woke up to Ethan talking in his sleep.

He woke up too, wiping cold sweat from his forehead. He checked his phone, then went to the study to work.

He was always like this. Stubborn. Never soft.

I thought maliciously: What will you do when you remember you blocked me? When you realize I died on your birthday?

But it didn't matter anymore.

I was too lazy to move. I realized I could drift further from him now. I turned over and went back to sleep.

When I woke up again, Ethan’s phone was ringing.

He put it on speaker. It was his assistant.

"Mr. Sterling..." The assistant sounded cautious.

Ethan was impatient. "Speak."

"Sir, there's a life insurance policy for Miss Maya waiting for your confirmation regarding the flight accident."

His body swayed, but he steadied himself quickly.

"Check again. It must be a mistake. Lily changed her flight, maybe the insurance didn't update. It's an error."

"But, Miss Maya..."

Ethan cut him off. "Don't bother me with these trivial errors. I pay you a high salary to handle details, not to waste my time."

"By the way, make sure Lily's dance troupe gets set up properly."

The assistant mumbled an agreement and hung up. "Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Sterling. I'll have someone else handle it."

I understood. My death was just a "trivial error."

Chapter 4

Watching Ethan’s trembling hand, maybe he wasn't completely oblivious.

I was starting to look forward to the moment he learned the truth.

Lily appeared, interrupting the silence.

"Ethan, are you worried about Maya? Don't worry, she's probably with Sarah."

She showed him her phone. It was Sarah’s Instagram story: a drawing of two cartoon figures hugging. Caption: [Taking you home.]

We always sent that image to each other when we were sad.

My eyes burned.

Sarah must be heartbroken.

On the plane, I recorded a digital will. I left everything to her.

I only trusted her. I knew she would pick a resting place far away from these people.

I'm sorry, Sarah. I can't grow old with you.

Ethan looked at the screen and visibly relaxed.

Then he remembered something. He pulled the hair tie out of his pocket. "Lily, is this yours or Maya's?"

Lily looked unnatural for a split second. "Oh, I forgot. Maybe Maya left it in my room."

Ethan looked thoughtful and put the tie in a drawer.

Lily bit her lip. "Ethan, can you come to the dance studio with me today?"

"I already told my assistant. He'll arrange everything," Ethan said while tying his tie.

Lily’s eyes filled with tears. "I just thought... if Mom and Dad knew I had my own troupe, they'd be so happy."

Ethan fell silent. His voice softened. "I'll come by later."

Lily smiled.

He couldn't get his tie right, so he ripped it off.

"Ethan, let me help." She took the tie in her hands.

Ethan stared at her hands, zoning out.

I remembered once, I helped him with his tie. The silk wrapped around my wrist, and he lost control.

He didn't leave the house all day, almost missing a major negotiation.

Afterward, he told me, "Maya, don't come over for a while. You're a distraction. I need to clear my head."

I held back my tears.

During his "cooling off" period, Lily posted photos of him watching car races with her.

Caption: [My brother taking a break for me.] [Relaxing with you, not stealing your heart.]

Whether Ethan loved me or not, Lily was always a thorn waiting to prick me.

"No need." Ethan snapped back to reality.

He pulled the tie from Lily’s hands and closed the closet door.

Lily stood frozen.

I heard her whisper, "Maya, you're dead. He's mine sooner or later."

I answered her, Take him. I don't want him anymore.

Ethan burst out of the closet. "Maya!"

I stared at him in horror, covering my mouth. Can... can he hear me? That’s scary.

He didn't find me. His expression fell.

Finally, he took out his phone.

He realized I was still on his block list.

He seemed relieved, probably finding an excuse for my silence.

He unblocked me and called.

Silence.

Naturally. My SIM card had turned to ash along with me.

He tried three times, then called Sarah.

Sarah sounded nasally. She must have been crying for days.

"What?"

Unused to Sarah’s coldness, Ethan frowned. "Put Maya on."

"Rude. Maya doesn't want to see you."
