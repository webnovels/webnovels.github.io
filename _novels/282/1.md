Hearing the voices outside the door, my pupils constricted.

What? Serena wants to take my kidney and give it to Aiden?!

That backstabbing snake!

I couldn't believe it; I suspected I was losing my mind.

But the voices outside continued.

Reminding me, this wasn’t a dream!

“Dr. Serena, isn't this too cruel? After all, it was your surgical error that caused him to become a vegetable in the first place.”

The nurse’s voice was a little muffled.

Serena was silent for a moment, then sighed:

“Yes, karma is real, and what goes around comes around. I caused Caleb's condition, so I should have taken care of him all these years.”

“Now, using his kidney to save Aiden… ultimately, I owe him. When my time comes, I’ll apologize to him then.”

It felt like a giant hand had squeezed my heart.

I was suffocating.

I truly believed Serena had fought with every ounce of her being to save me, then dedicated years to my meticulous care.

I saw her as my savior, thinking I'd owe her my very soul in the next life to repay her.

But all of it was a lie.

She was the one who ruined my life!

What was even more despairing was that if I had died during that surgery, or fallen into a complete coma, I wouldn’t be suffering this much.

But no, I could still hear, and I could still feel pain.

The door creaked open, and Serena walked in.

“All the readings are getting weaker.”

She stared at the tubes sticking out of my body, her voice tinged with a sigh.

“I’m sorry, Caleb, but Aiden can’t wait any longer. We need to prepare for the kidney removal surgery tomorrow.”

Her usually calm voice was now laced with a complicated mix of emotions.

There was guilt, reluctance, but more than anything, grim determination.

My blood ran cold.

A powerful panic seized me; I wanted to open my eyes, to look at her.

Serena, if you found out I was still conscious, would you still go through with it?

But my body was paralyzed, I couldn’t do anything.

The door chimed again, and someone else entered.

“Sister, I’m in so much pain. It’s been getting worse lately.”

It was Aiden.

What I couldn't see was him intimately wrapping his arms around Serena, resting his chin on her shoulder.

“But don’t be too hasty. I’m afraid Caleb might still be conscious and feel the pain.”

What a considerate tone he used.

Listening to him, my teeth ached with suppressed rage.

Aiden came from an impoverished mountain village. Serena had saved him during an accident.

It was *I* who saw how strong and unfortunate he was, and I paid all his expenses from middle school through college.

I gave him the chance to escape his village and soar.

He once cried, promising he would repay me.

I believed he was a good, grateful kid, and I trusted him like a younger brother.

I never imagined he would stab me in the back.

Now, I wished I could tear that backstabbing snake limb from limb.

“No, your illness can’t wait. His vital signs are fading fast. The surgery can proceed tomorrow.”

She wrapped her arms around him, pressing a soft kiss to his lips.

Aiden’s lips curved into a smile, and he kissed her back with passion.

I couldn’t see their movements.

But I heard the sickening wet sounds of skin slapping against skin.
