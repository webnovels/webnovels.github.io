I was my father's illegitimate daughter, my sole purpose in life for two decades was to be a walking bone marrow bank for my half-sister.

To make me willingly donate my bone marrow for the last time, my father promised me a fiancé.

"Pick one. After the surgery, he'll take you away, and you'll never want for anything again."

I chose Julian Hayes, who had always been the kindest to me. He was my sister's attending physician.

But the second before I was wheeled into the operating room, he drained my life-saving blood.

I was abandoned in the morgue, that bag of blood transfused into another woman's body.

"Sierra, don't be afraid. I used that illegitimate girl's blood to save your life. You are my whole world."

Every minute, my body temperature dropped by one degree.

240 minutes later, my blood congealed, and my soul froze.

When I opened my eyes again, I was back to the day I chose my fiancé.

In front of my father, the nine gilded résumés still lay there.

This time, I bypassed Julian and picked the man from his stack of business documents – the rumored ruthless and heartless arch-rival.

But my father scoffed, "Him? He's practically on his deathbed."
