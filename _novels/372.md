My son had dwarfism.

I quit my job, scouring clinics far and wide, giving him growth hormone shots, and accompanying him through rigorous training in all weather. Finally, I helped him become the youngest world champion.

But the moment he stood on the podium, he accused me, his father, of being cold-blooded and selfish to the global media.

Faced with an overwhelming wave of online hate and abuse, my wife threw divorce papers at me.

She said I wasn’t fit to be a father or a husband, then turned around and married the single dad downstairs who cooked gourmet meals.

It wasn't until I was on my deathbed that I found out my wife had cheated on me with that man the very day I quit my job.

My son even helped her hide it, claiming that was the only place he could find a moment of peace.

When I opened my eyes again, I was back to the day my son was diagnosed with dwarfism.

"Don't listen to the doctor's nonsense. Our son is just a late bloomer. Is bothering my mom the only thing you do all day?"

Watching my wife and son look at me like an enemy, I curved my lips into a sneer. Fine, then. No treatment. I'm done catering to you all.
