“Liam, do you think they really don’t regret it?”

“Isn’t this just selling their bodies? It’s disgusting.”

The moment I opened my eyes, I heard that familiar complaining voice.

I looked at Chloe. Though she claimed it was disgusting, the envy in her eyes was almost palpable.

It was so obvious, yet how could I have been so blind in my past life?

Just as I was about to speak, Darian, the CEO, who was holding my girlfriend, Briana, looked at me with disdain.

“Liam, this is my way of making sure everyone survives.”

“There’s no absolute fairness in this world. Only those who hold power get to make the rules.”

The men who had benefited nodded in agreement.

“Exactly. You’re not, like, embarrassed to show yourself to women because you’re bad in bed, are you?”

“They don’t mind, so why do you, a grown man, care so much? Just drop the holier-than-thou act.”

Briana couldn’t help but snicker.

“Don’t even get me started. We’ve been together this long, and he never even touched me. Who knows what’s wrong with him.”

It used to be her who refused my touch, saying I only cared about her body. But now, she was turning it around, questioning my masculinity.

Sure enough, for the person she desired, she could say anything.

I didn’t beg her for an explanation as I had in the past. Instead, I turned to Chloe.

In my previous life, everyone had accepted this twisted way of life. Only she, after my desperate pleas, was the sole person who didn’t go along with it.

Later, she even agreed to start a business with me and move towards marriage.

I thought she was the only sane one.

But I never expected that the moment I uncovered the truth, she would stab me, even pouring out her deep affection for Darian.

This love was hidden too perfectly, even I, her childhood best friend, hadn’t noticed.

Just then, Darian’s gaze fell upon her.

“You’re quite pretty. If you’re willing, you could play with me for a few days.”

His flippant words easily made Chloe’s breathing erratic.

Seeing her about to lose control and walk over, I simply stood up to leave.

But she grabbed my hand.

I was stunned.

I thought she would leave with me, just like in my past life, but her complex gaze met mine.

“Most of the girls here are single, but your girlfriend isn’t. Can’t you take her with you?”

In that instant, it felt like an electric current shot through me, from head to toe.

Chloe, had she also been reborn?

As if to confirm my thoughts, she walked over, took Briana’s hand, and placed it in mine.

Her eyes were filled with wariness.

Right. Darian was a sucker for a pretty face. Besides Chloe herself, Briana was the most beautiful here.

“Are you trying to get me killed?”

Briana gnashed her teeth, scoffing as she yanked her hand away from mine.

“If I don’t get into that company, I swear I’ll haunt you two even in death.”

She whispered it, but my hearing had always been excellent since childhood. I heard it loud and clear.

I felt like I’d been struck by lightning.

So, my girlfriend from the last life already knew this was a company compliance test?

No wonder she was so proactive.

And she could just watch so many people go down a path of no return?

My heart grew even colder.

I couldn’t help but sneer, but Chloe was still wary of me, afraid I’d ruin her plans.

“Liam, try to be open-minded. This is actually very normal.”

“If you can’t accept it, then just leave us alone. Don’t bother us.”

She was solely focused on competing with Briana, but she had no idea the path she was on now was a dead end.

Joining that company was their first step towards despair.

The company was a playground for perverted rich guys, offering them ‘toys’. They had no real jobs, just endless forced performances.

The reason Briana married Darian was because she had lost all value. Her ultimate fate would be the same as his previous wives – a convenient ‘accident’.

I had investigated all this, but Chloe wouldn’t give me a chance to speak.

Thinking of the suffocating feeling of being stabbed to death in my past life, I pushed Chloe forward.

“Fight for it. If you want something, go snatch it.”
