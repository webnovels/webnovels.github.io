The moment the words left my mouth, they all stared at me, astonished.

They seemed unable to believe those words had come from me.

Briana looked at me with pity.

“I know it’s unfair to you that two women you like are involved with someone else, but I’m in a special situation right now. Just put up with it.”

“If you can’t handle it, then let’s just break up for now.”

The old me would always be sensitive to her jokes like that, forcing her to take back any mention of breaking up.

But now, I just smiled.

“I thought we broke up ages ago, the moment you chose to trade your body.”

With that, I turned to leave.

It was just three days, right?

I could wait.

Briana’s smile froze.

Before I could take a step, Darian grabbed me.

“Alright, don’t act like I stole your woman. We’re all men here, no need for so much fuss. Come on, join us.”

A few men stepped forward, grabbing me by each arm. I struggled wildly.

“No, I won’t! Let go of me!”

Remembering what they wanted me to do, my stomach churned, and I pushed them away and threw up.

Darian’s face was grim for a moment, then he suddenly burst out laughing.

“I’ve never seen a guy as pure as you.”

“You’re so stubborn. Now I really want you to join us.”

Briana and Chloe clearly didn’t want me to, but Darian just looked at them with an arrogant smirk.

“If I don’t make him come, he’ll go around spreading rumors about me stealing his woman.”

“Don’t worry, we won’t do anything like that. It’s just a simple party. You’ll see when you get there.”

Chloe’s outstretched hand froze, but she still managed a strained smile.

“I knew Mr. Darian wasn’t like that. How could he possibly lust after our bodies?”

Briana, though disappointed, also breathed a sigh of relief.

“Yeah, who would be so blatant about trading bodies? That’s illegal. It’s just a joke.”

“Alright, Liam, the misunderstanding is cleared up. Only if you go yourself will you believe Mr. Darian’s good intentions. Stop making a fuss.”

Others chimed in.

“Exactly! Even if we’re stranded on a deserted island, it’s still a civilized society. No one would seriously do that.”

“Since you don’t care about us, just go watch your girlfriend. She definitely won’t do anything out of line.”

The more they tried to make me go, the more uneasy I felt.

I struggled desperately.

“I broke up with her! I’m not going!”

Briana rolled her eyes impatiently.

“It’s not like we haven’t broken up before. We’ll still end up together, won’t we?”

I almost choked.

Was she going to cling to me even to death?

I struggled violently, but more people held me down, forcibly dragging me away.

In despair, I desperately clutched Chloe’s clothes.

“Once you go, there’s no turning back! You know this isn’t just a compliance test, it’s…”

Chloe suddenly yelled, cutting me off, covering my mouth and whispering in my ear.

“I know there’s something wrong with their company.”

“But how can you guarantee I won’t be the one Darian treats specially?”

“There’s no way I’m worse than that idiot Briana, right?”

My eyes widened, and I even forgot to breathe.

She really was crazy for what she called love, to this extent.

I opened my mouth to yell and snap her out of it, but someone shoved a rag in my mouth.

“Shut up! You’ll find out when we get there.”

I was shoved into a metal barrel and rolled away, unable to make a sound. I could only stare wide-eyed at Chloe, hoping she’d understand what I meant.

But she only bothered to flirt with Darian, completely ignoring my fate.

But when I finally reached their tent, I couldn’t help but gasp.

Screams echoed in my ears.
