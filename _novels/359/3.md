Before my eyes were men and women, pantsless and engaging in orgies. They seemed to have forgotten the world, lost in their own pleasure.

All the girls covered their faces, yet couldn’t help but peek.

The air was thick with a foul, musky scent. Realizing someone had arrived, they stopped, brazenly exposing themselves as they looked at us.

Darian watched our stunned expressions and then let out an abrupt laugh.

“Don’t be scared. These are just savages from the island. They don’t count as women. At best, they’re just human sex dolls.”

“We would never treat actual women like this.”

Only then did everyone look closely and realize they indeed looked different from regular humans, covered in an alarming amount of body hair.

Everyone breathed a sigh of relief, but my heart was filled with despair.

Since we’d landed on the island, Darian’s people had thoroughly explored the entire place. There was no way to escape.

Darian handed each girl a cup of grass juice, saying that if they drank it, they could join them and be protected.

Facing the girls’ suspicious glances, Darian merely smiled faintly.

“This is a potion our male doctor researched. After drinking it, you’ll just fall asleep. It’ll make you feel refreshed and cleanse all toxins, with no other side effects.”

He made it sound appealing, but I clearly smelled the scent of an aphrodisiac within it.

I desperately tried to signal Chloe, who was also a medical major, hoping she would reveal the truth.

But she was the first to step forward.

“He’s right, this really is good for us.”

With that, she drank it directly.

Once one person started, others quickly followed suit.

Briana, unwilling to be outdone, drank two cups.

Her face flushed, she looked at Darian.

“Can we pick our favorite man to protect us while we’re passed out?”

I couldn’t watch anymore. I broke free from the men holding me and sharply slapped Chloe across the face.

“Are you insane? Spit it out, quickly!”

“If the drug takes effect, no one can save you!”

Chloe pushed me away, kicking me hard.

“This has nothing to do with you! If you dare to interfere, I swear I won’t let you go!”

My head buzzed.

I felt like the world had completely surpassed my expectations.

They were all crazy.

I gritted my teeth.

“Don’t forget, you all have to go back to civilization! What will your families think if they find out?”

“Then you just don’t say anything! No one will ever know!”

Seeing the naked killing intent in her eyes, I utterly lost my voice.

She was no longer the little sister who used to follow me around, calling me Liam.

That last flicker of hope in my heart was thoroughly extinguished by cold water.

Meanwhile, Briana had already collapsed into Darian’s arms.

She restlessly tugged at her flimsy, barely-there clothes, yet she still didn't forget to scorn me.

“What could possibly happen? You’re making such a big deal out of nothing!”

“Liam, how can you make up such lies just to target Mr. Darian?”

“He said it was just a joke before, and now he’s helping us with our health! Do you just despise him that much?”

Not just her, several other girls had started stripping their clothes.

The men who had tasted the sweetness had their eyes glued on them.

Their warning gazes all turned to me.

“Are you done yet? What do you do all day besides maliciously guessing at people?”

“This is just a normal treatment, isn’t it? Look how much your girlfriend is enjoying it! You don’t know a good thing when you see it!”

Several people were already kissing. I couldn’t imagine what would happen if I stayed here, so I frantically ran out of the tent.

A few men immediately came up and dragged me back inside.

Briana, mustering her strength, struggled over and kicked me.

“You just can’t stand to see me doing well.”

“Since he’s so ungrateful, just forget about him! Throw him into the sea to feed the sharks! Don’t let him bother us!”

Darian smoothly pulled her shoulder closer, his lips curling into a scornful smirk at me. Then, right in front of me, he slid his hand into her clothes, eliciting moans from her.

However, the R-rated scene didn't play out in front of me. Chloe, who suddenly rushed out, interrupted them.

She twisted Darian’s neck and kissed him fiercely. Darian froze for a moment, then pressed into her.
