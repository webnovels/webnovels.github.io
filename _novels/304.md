"I started spotting in my fourth month of pregnancy. My husband, a renowned OB-GYN, told me to go to my check-up alone.

I didn't try to stop him. I just watched, quietly, as he rushed out the door to be with his childhood friend, Mia, who was drunk and threatening to do something stupid.

Last time, he went with me to the check-up. He saved me. I had a high-risk pregnancy.

Mia never saw him. She went crazy after drinking, falling from a rooftop, a bloody mess.

He disappeared for three days. When he came back, he was calm. We looked forward to the birth of our child, together.

But when I went into labor, he insisted on delivering the baby himself.

He watched, coldly, as I writhed in pain, bleeding uncontrollably. He refused to do a C-section.

I begged him to save our baby.

He brought up the past, icily.

""You didn't have any problems at that check-up. You lied, used the baby to manipulate me. That's why I couldn't save her!""

""Mia was so young, so good. She wouldn't have died so horribly if it weren't for you. I wish it were you and the baby who died instead!""

I opened my eyes, back to the day of the bleeding, the day of the check-up.

I watched him brush past me, rush out the door. I knew he remembered, too."
