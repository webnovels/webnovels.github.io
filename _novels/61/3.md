As soon as I entered, Phoebe Clark greeted me with a smile.

Her gaze fixed on my hands.

My hands were pale, veins visible beneath the skin.

"Addie, your skin is so delicate. Jasper's like a beast, full of energy, probably afraid to touch you."

"Or you'd die in bed!"

A snicker erupted: "It's not fear, it's unwillingness! Otherwise, how has our Mrs. Reed remained a pure lady all these years?"

Everyone burst into laughter, their gazes on me more lewd and disdainful.

I frowned, my cheeks burning.

"Enough! Haven't you had enough?"

I snapped.

Jasper Reed looked displeased, glaring at me.

"They're complimenting you for being pure, and you're upset? Stop embarrassing me!"

I clenched my fists, my face darkening further.

Someone intervened, laughing it off:

"Addie, they're just joking! Don't be mad! How about I toast to you?"

He downed his wine and offered another glass to me.

Everyone's gaze fell on the wine, tense.

I pushed it away with a smirk:

"I accept the apology, but I won't drink!"

Jasper Reed's face turned as dark as a storm, his voice filled with anger.

"People have been calling you pure and virtuous, and they were wrong? Stop making a scene here!"

I clenched my fists, my expression darkening.

Noticing this, someone tried to lighten the mood with a laugh:

"Addie, we're all just joking! Don't get upset! Here, let me propose a toast to you."

With that, the man downed his red wine and offered me another glass.

Everyone's eyes were on that glass, tension hanging in the air as they waited for me to drink.

I smirked with disdain and pushed the glass away:

"I accept the apology, but I'm not drinking!"

Jasper Reed's expression was thunderous, his voice sharp with anger:

"Adeline! You're going too far! Not even accepting a drink from my friend? Have you lost your mind?"

"Have I?"

I replied icily, instinctively stepping back, my gaze wary of Jasper Reed.

"Who's lost their mind, you or me? Tonight..."

Before I could finish, a sharp pain shot through my neck.

My legs gave way, and I collapsed, my consciousness slipping away.

"This sedative works wonders!"

"I've been ready for this. Those rich old guys are practically fighting over Adeline! The auction can't afford any mistakes!"

Phoebe Clark provocatively leaned on Jasper Reed:

"Addie, don't worry, we'll find you the wealthiest man. Make sure your first time is worth a fortune!"

With all my strength, I crawled to Jasper Reed's feet, clutching his pant leg, pleading:

"Let me go... I don't want to be with other men..."

Jasper Reed kicked me away:

"Enough! Stop pretending to be some virtuous woman! Didn't you want someone to touch you? I'm giving away my rights, finding you a strong stand-in partner. You should be happy!"

He hugged Phoebe Clark tightly, a stark contrast to how he used to avoid my touch.

Disappointment surged through me.

The next moment, rough hands dragged me away, stripped me, and threw me into a fully transparent glass enclosure.

I helplessly pounded on the box, begging them to let me out.

They ignored me, their eyes filled with desire.

In despair, I closed my eyes as staff carried me backstage, waiting for my turn.

Just then, Mrs. Reed finally arrived.

She ordered my rescue and personally dressed me.

"I'm sorry, Addie, Jasper Reed is such a jerk!"

Mrs. Reed handed me the divorce agreement, instructing her assistant to get me out immediately.

Outside the auction venue, I cried uncontrollably until I passed out.

By then, the auction had reached its climax.

Everyone was eagerly awaiting my appearance.

"Where's Adeline?"

Jasper Reed was puzzled, "Why isn't she on stage yet?"

Amidst the eager gazes, Mrs. Reed slowly took the stage.

Jasper Reed's face immediately changed.

Mrs. Reed threw the signed divorce agreement at Jasper Reed's face:

"You jerk! Where's Adeline? She's gone, remarried! From now on, she's calling someone else husband, and you have nothing to do with her anymore!"

I apologize for any confusion earlier. Could you please provide the specific Chinese text you need translated?
