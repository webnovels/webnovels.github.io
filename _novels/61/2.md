It was dark when I finally got home.

For the first time, Jasper Reed wasn't furious. Instead, he looked at me with interest.

But the woman's hair tie on the coffee table and the sexy ladies' underwear on the chair clearly indicated what had happened.

"What? You don't want me to touch you?"

Jasper Reed blocked my path, his breath hitting my neck as he spoke.

Thinking about him putting my "contractual rights" on the auction, I felt an unexpected calm.

"It's late. Let's rest."

I turned towards the bedroom, but Jasper Reed pulled me back.

He pinned me to the sofa, eyes full of anger.

"What are you pretending for? Haven't you always wanted something to happen between us?"

As he spoke, he roughly stripped me of all my clothes.

I stood naked before him.

He turned his head aside and shoved me into the bedroom.

"Wait here obediently. I'll be in soon. If you can't wait, you can handle it yourself first."

Jasper Reed locked the door.

Terrified, I pounded on the door, unable to open it. Feeling the chill, I frantically searched for clothes.

But I found nothing, not even bed sheets or curtains.

As I was about to give up, a blinding reflection hit my face.

I realized the windows of the opposite building were filled with binoculars.

"My God! That's Adeline? Her body is perfect!"

"Good thing I'm Jasper's bro. I get a sneak peek!"

"With that face and body, I must spend big at this auction!"

I froze.

Those disgusting gazes were like knives stabbing into my heart.

Fear consumed me. I ran to the door, pounding on it frantically.

"Jasper Reed! Please let me out! There are people outside, a lot of them!"

My pleas received no response. The silence outside was terrifying.

The excitement of the gazes grew more intense. I could only crawl under the bed, curling up to protect myself.

Until I was on the brink of collapse, Jasper Reed finally opened the door.

"Enough! Stop pretending to be a saint!"

Jasper Reed sneered, tossing me a towel.

I quickly wrapped the towel around myself.

Jasper Reed's phone suddenly buzzed. He answered:

"Jasper, that video went viral! Several creepy old men are starting bids at millions! Adeline's going to enjoy this!"

Jasper Reed quickly ended the call, looking at me guiltily.

I suddenly realized the entire bedroom was equipped with high-definition surveillance. My naked image had been shared with every wealthy man participating in the auction.

My blood froze, and I struggled to breathe.

"Jasper Reed! How could you do this to me!"

"Come on! Is it really that big of a deal?"

Jasper Reed shrugged dismissively, calling for the maid to bring a long dress.

"How about this? I'll take you to an auction tonight as an apology!"

At this, my whole body trembled.

"No! I'm not going!"

I instinctively refused.

Jasper Reed's face darkened ominously.

"Have I been too lenient? Do you dare question my decision?"

"Phoebe even asked me to buy you luxury goods women love. You're not even worthy!"

He glanced at my red hands.

"Look at you, you're supposed to be a socialite, but even the servants are better maintained than you!"

My chest tightened with bitterness.

Over the years, Jasper Reed's obsessive demands forced me to hand-wash all his belongings.

Yet now, he saw me as less than a servant.

Seeing me silent, Jasper Reed grabbed my neck, dragging me into the disinfectant pool.

After disinfecting, he wrapped me tightly in a towel, disgust evident in his eyes.

I was forcibly dressed up and taken to the banquet hall hosting the auction.
