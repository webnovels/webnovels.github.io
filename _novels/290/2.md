I looked at the divorce agreement, and my eyes immediately caught the glaring words: "Leave empty-handed."

My lingering doubts vanished. I slapped the divorce agreement onto his face. "Leo, are you taking me for a fool?! Leave empty-handed?!"

Leo panicked. "Why are you so materialistic now? It's not a real divorce. Bianca is about to give birth; I'm just in a hurry, okay? You're being so unreasonable!"

"Calculating assets takes time. This way, we can get it done quickly. It'll also be easier to remarry later."

I took a deep breath. "Leo, have you ever considered that for the past ten years, I've been your biggest charity project?"

Leo froze, clearly not expecting me to say that. "Anya, how can you think that? I genuinely love you."

I sneered. "Love? Your love is constantly pushing me aside to 'save' those who 'need help more'?"

Leo frantically explained, "This time it's really different. Bianca is truly pitiful, she—"

Leo's ears turned red. I knew that was his tell when he was lying.

Bianca had sent a selfie along with her message in the group chat.

Aside from her eight-month pregnant belly, she had large breasts, a slender waist, long legs, and a pretty face. Her voice was incredibly sweet too.

He was clearly just after her looks.

Leo continued to argue, "Anya, you have to believe me, this is purely a charitable act! I swear to you, as soon as Bianca gives birth and recovers, I'll remarry you immediately!"

I looked at him, this man I had loved deeply for ten years.

Fine lines were starting to appear around his eyes, and his hair was thinning, but the fanaticism for "charity" in his eyes, the obsession with playing the savior, had never changed.

I asked softly, "What if I don't agree? What if I say that if we divorce, we'll never remarry?"

Just then, Leo's phone rang. A delicate voice on the other end cried out in pain, "Leo, my stomach hurts so much, can you come see me?"

Leo rushed out, not even stopping to grab his jacket. "Don't overthink it. I'll go check on Bianca first."

I sat at the dining table, looking at the meal I'd cooked myself. Leo hadn't touched a bite.

After much deliberation, I dialed my lawyer's number.

Before I could call, Leo called me. A tiny flicker of hope ignited in my heart.

Leo's voice was anxious. "Anya, Bianca's stomach isn't feeling well, and she wants chicken soup. Your chicken soup is the best; quickly make some and bring it over. Oh, and by the way, Bianca is allergic to mushrooms, so don't put any in."

Leo hung up immediately after saying that.

His social media updated with a photo of him hugging a woman's pregnant belly: "Wishing a smooth delivery."

Uninformed mutual friends specifically congratulated me, "Anya, you're so far along and didn't even tell us, that's so unfair! But still, congratulations!"

I looked at the congratulatory messages, finding them utterly ironic.

When I arrived at the hospital with the chicken soup and the newly drafted divorce agreement, I saw Leo "caring" for his new wife.

"What are you doing?!"

The scene before me stung my eyes. I angrily threw the chicken soup onto the table. "Leo, we're not even divorced yet, and you're doing this with her?!"

The hospital room door wasn't even closed. In broad daylight, Bianca lay on the hospital bed, legs wide open, enjoying Leo's caresses.

Seeing me, Leo quickly withdrew his hand and smiled, explaining, "Anya, don't misunderstand. The doctor just came to check and said Bianca has a slight breech presentation, causing uterine pain. I was helping her massage her uterus to correct the position."

Leo pulled his hand away so quickly that Bianca didn't have time to react. She was still trembling on the bed, in the lingering afterglow of Leo's "massage."

"Leo, I feel much better after your massage. I think the baby's position is even correcting itself. Can you massage me again?"

Bianca's face was flushed. Leo, without a shred of shame, immediately agreed in front of me, even self-righteously stating, "For the baby's safety, of course!"

Leo, in front of me, reached his hand between Bianca's legs again. "Anya, you want a healthy baby too, don't you?"

Before I could speak, Bianca cried out in pleasure, "Leo, you're so good at this! You'll definitely be a great dad..."

"I'm a little hungry. Could you please ask Anya to feed me some chicken soup?"
