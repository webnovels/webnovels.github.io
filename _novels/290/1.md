Leo looked overjoyed. "That's great, Anya! I knew you'd always support my cause!"

He smiled brightly and casually asked, "What charity are you doing, darling?"

As I rummaged for our marriage certificate, I replied, "The male college student I sponsor has late-stage cancer. His last wish is to marry a rich woman for good luck."

At my words, Leo's face immediately fell. He lectured me with a righteous air, "Anya, how can you just marry anyone?"

"Are you upset? Don't worry, it's just a charity marriage. I'm only marrying her so she and the child won't be gossiped about. I absolutely won't be intimate with her! You know me, Anya, I can't stand to see others suffer."

I scoffed. "Oh, I know."

Especially when it comes to beautiful young women between 18 and 28.

After ten years of marriage, I knew Leo's "charity sickness" all too well.

The first year, he met a depressed girl named Skylar on a psychological help forum.

Initially, it was just online chats, but it quickly escalated to daily, unfailing in-person "counseling sessions."

I stumbled upon their chat history once.

"Leo, if it weren't for you, I'd be dead by now."

"Silly girl, I'll always be there for you."

Beyond that, there were hundreds of nude photos. Leo's explanation for them was, "The therapist said that a person's body best reflects their psychological state. I'm just helping her heal."

I just figured he was flirting online to get his kicks and didn't take it too seriously.

But that winter, Leo, who usually hated moving, went out almost every night, claiming he was "walking and talking" with Skylar to clear her mind.

On the coldest day, I personally saw them embracing and kissing at the community gate, completely oblivious to others. Skylar was practically plastered against him, and he was stroking her back with movements so fluid, it looked like they'd practiced a thousand times.

When I angrily confronted him, he looked innocent. "Anya, Skylar said my embrace and lips reminded her of her ex-boyfriend's. She missed him so much... she was on the verge of suicide! I was saving her life!"

Later, Skylar's condition "improved," and she moved out of town. Leo was gloomy and dispirited for an entire month, even forgetting our wedding anniversary.

The second year, Leo's infertile friend, Mike, cried to him about wanting a child for so many years of marriage. Leo immediately offered to help without a second thought.

I still remember his expression when he came home that day; he looked as if he'd just saved the world.

He excitedly grabbed my hand. "Anya, Mike and his wife are truly pathetic. We should help them if we can."

I was happy then, foolishly thinking he'd just donated money for them to go to the hospital.

It wasn't until three months later that Mike's wife showed up at our door, visibly pregnant. She grabbed my hand, sobbing with gratitude. "Sister-in-law, it's all thanks to Leo! If it weren't for him, I'd still be suffering from Mike's abuse... But sister-in-law, you're truly blessed to have a husband as capable and doting as Leo."

Mike's wife even wanted to show me a video of Leo's "excellent genetic donation" process. I was trembling with anger.

The third year, he was "personally deflowering pure young college girls."

The fourth year, he was "giving intimate massages to young married women."

...

And now, on our tenth wedding anniversary, he was going to be a "savior" for a beautiful pregnant woman he'd never even met.

Leo noticed I was upset and quickly explained, "Anya, I'm doing all this for you! I've already talked to her; once the baby is born, I'll give her some money, and the child will be ours to raise."

"That way, Mom won't yell at you anymore. I pity you, Anya!"

Leo sounded completely convincing. I looked at him skeptically. "Really?"

After so many years of marriage, I still hadn't had a child.

This had indeed been a persistent heartache for both of us.

Leo immediately nodded. "Of course! You're my wife! Oh, by the way, the divorce agreement is ready. You should sign it."
