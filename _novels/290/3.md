I was speechless, utterly shocked by Bianca's shamelessness.

She was enjoying my husband's caresses and then had the audacity to ask me to feed her chicken soup!

I clutched the divorce agreement tightly, swallowing my anger, and shoved it into my bag.

There was no way we could discuss anything like this today. "How are you going to drink lying like that?"

I merely asked roughly, and Bianca's eyes immediately reddened. She bit her lower lip and clutched Leo's hand, looking pitiful. "Leo, did I make Anya upset? But if you don't massage me, my stomach really hurts... Listen, the baby is crying from hunger..."

Leo leaned close to Bianca's belly, listened for a moment, and then clicked his tongue. "If Bianca is hungry, just feed her. You're going to be a mother yourself someday; can't you be a little more patient?"

I laughed. "Me, impatient? Can't she do one thing at a time instead of making both of us wait on her hand and foot?"

Even adopting a child properly wouldn't involve this kind of servitude.

Leo said earnestly, "You've never been pregnant; how could you know how hard it is? Bianca's stomach hurts and she's hungry; why can't you..."

"You feed her! I'm not serving you!"

I slammed the door shut, the lingering, unpleasant stench still in my nostrils.

The divorce agreement remained unresolved until three days later, when Leo returned home.

He smiled at me, discussing, "Anya, it's too unsafe for Bianca, a pregnant woman, to live alone outside. How about she moves into our house?"

Before I could agree, someone was already moving Bianca's belongings in, even into the master bedroom.

I slapped the divorce agreement onto the table. "Fine. But sign this first."

Leo glanced at it and said, "That can wait."

Bianca followed closely behind. As soon as she entered, she pointed at my dog. "Oh my! What a huge dog! You scared me to death... Leo, I'm so scared..."

Leo blurted out, "Get rid of the dog immediately!"

I quickly shielded my dog. "Don't you dare!"

"You handle your business. I'll take the dog myself."

I stormed out with my dog, heading to a hotel. At the hotel entrance, I ran into Liam, the male college student I sponsored.

It was over ninety degrees, and he was sweating profusely, handing out flyers at the hotel entrance.

Liam looked incredibly surprised to see me and quickly ran over. "Sister Anya! Why are you out in this heat?"

I wasn't in the mood to explain, so I just hedged. "Just out walking Rusty. I'm tired and want to rest for a bit."

"Why are you... carrying luggage while walking your dog? Are you staying at a hotel? Let me help you with Rusty."

Liam enthusiastically pulled Rusty and accompanied me to check in.

At the room door, I stopped Liam. "You can stop here. Thank you for your trouble. How's school lately? Do you have enough for living expenses? If not, I can give you more..."

As I spoke, I took a wad of cash from my bag, but Liam smiled and interrupted me. "I have enough. I make enough money working part-time. Sister Anya, can I come in and take a shower?"

I hesitated, then looked at him again. Liam's clothes were soaked and smelled of dog urine.

I smiled awkwardly at him. "Come on in."

Liam was in the bathroom showering. I had just sat down to rest when Leo burst in.

I looked at him in confusion. "Why are you here?"

Leo stormed in furiously. Just then, Liam emerged from the bathroom.

He was shirtless, young and vibrant. Leo instantly exploded. "What are you two doing?!"
