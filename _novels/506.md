Seven days left.

The scene was terrifyingly clear: a blood-splattered zombie lunged at me, its pale, decaying face looming larger and larger.

 I didn't even know where it bit me before I blacked out.

Now, I was waking up, it was evening. After college, I chose to be a streamer.

 I’d gotten into the habit of sleeping in the afternoon and starting my stream once I woke up.

 I wasn't sure if the previous image was just a dream, but one detail stuck with me vividly.

If this was a second chance, then tonight, one of my favorite celebrities was about to have their world come crashing down. 

The only reason I remembered it so clearly was because I used to be a huge fan of this particular star. My childhood crush was just too perfect, leaving a deep impression.

Sure enough, at 9 PM, a trending topic suddenly exploded: "Jax's secret baby bombshell."

It was a rebirth!

Seven days from now, a global catastrophe would erupt – the zombie virus.

At first, it only appeared in a few coastal cities, quickly debunked by officials. 

I never paid attention to such unsubstantiated rumors. I just went with the flow online, yelling a few times about "believing in science," then ignored it.

Just three days. Only three days.

The zombie virus spun out of control. Initially, the government still used drones to announce they wouldn’t abandon anyone. Days later, even the drones vanished without a trace.

In my previous life, I survived for a month and a half purely on the snacks I’d hoarded. 

Once they ran out, I had no choice but to venture out for supplies.

 I hadn’t even made it out of my apartment complex before a zombie tackled me to the ground.

It was truly horrifying.

The signal went out too fast in my last life. What I regretted most was dying without knowing if my parents were safe.

Thinking of this, I immediately called them.

 "Hey, Mom, Dad. It's been snowing a lot in Silverwood City lately. Could you come visit? I'm craving Mom's homemade lasagna, could you come help me make some?"

My parents were those caring parents who always grumbled about how useless I was, still unable to make lasagna at my age, even as they promised they'd be right over tomorrow. 

Thankfully, they lived in the neighboring town of Maple Creek, so it wouldn’t take too long to get here. The sooner I got them close, the sooner I'd feel at ease. 

After retiring from their teaching jobs, they’d been enjoying retirement at home.

 I’d tried countless times to get them to move in with me, but they always felt they'd be a burden, stubbornly refusing. 

They’d visit every month or so, always bringing a carload of food.

This thought made me frantically SnapChat my dad: "Dad!!!! Don't forget my cured sausages!!!!"

Cured sausages last forever, even without a fridge. 

In my last life, the power went out on either the third or fourth day of the apocalypse. I frantically scribbled notes about the power issue on a piece of paper.

My paper was already filled with notes. Since finishing my college thesis, I hadn't used this much brainpower. Honestly, my thesis wasn't even this exhausting, because this was literally a matter of life or death.

It had been so long since I really thought.

 Even after my nap, I was still incredibly sleepy. I tucked the paper under my pillow, thinking about the tough fight ahead tomorrow, and drifted into a deep sleep.

First, I needed to reinforce the doors and windows.

My apartment was on the twenty-first floor. I bought this top-floor unit after college with my streaming income. 

To be honest, I was broke and didn't want to ask my parents for money again, so I chose a place far from the city center. 

Who would've thought that when the apocalypse hit, this complex would actually be safer?

There weren’t many supermarkets nearby, but luckily, there was a Costco warehouse store.

With that thought, I immediately called an installation company to have technicians come and reinforce my doors and windows.

"Miss, your door is sturdy enough already. It's like a fortified steel door, like something out of a bank vault. No need to reinforce it."

"My dad insisted on replacing this door for me. He always said a girl living alone wasn't safe. If it were up to me, I wouldn't like such a heavy door, but I couldn't win against my dad back then."

I then had the technicians replace all the glass in the apartment with the highest-grade bulletproof glass, and also add a one-way film.

 It was supposed to take three days to complete, but I just slipped them an extra ten thousand dollars. The technicians’ eyes practically disappeared into smiles.

"Can you guys try to finish this afternoon? My mom's coming over, and she's incredibly security-conscious, always worrying about worst-case scenarios."

Perhaps seeing that I was someone who wasn't afraid to spend, one of the technicians even asked if I wanted security bars installed.

"Install them!"

I couldn't drive, which posed a huge problem for getting supplies. 

My dad forced me to learn in college. At first, I was enthusiastic, until my driving instructor almost broke my spirit, and I failed the road test five times in a row. I finally gave up.

To keep my dad from yelling at me, I even tried to brainwash him: "Don't worry, self-driving cars will be the norm soon anyway!"

I first took a taxi to Costco. On the way, I used my banking apps to check how much money I had. 

My streaming career had been pretty lucrative over the years. All in all, I still had over seven hundred thousand dollars.

 I’d tell my parents when they got here. With their savings, we'd probably have over a million and a half.

I needed to buy so many things, and I didn't dare choose home delivery. In the apocalypse, people were the scariest things.

I headed straight for the shelf-stable food section.

 Normally, I could order these online and have them delivered in batches to different locations, but the problem was that Silverwood City had been hit by a continuous health advisory this year. 

There were still two active lockdown zones, so deliveries couldn't get in.

 I cleared out the entire shelf of ready-to-eat meals: about 150 shelf-stable meal kits, 100 ready-to-eat meals, and over fifty dehydrated soup pouches and instant noodle cups.

Fortunately, Costco's shopping carts were huge; I pushed two. While waiting in line to pay, I got a call from my dad. Don't let his age fool you; my dad had a commercial driver's license (CDL).

 I just made up an excuse and called him over. "Dad, can you rent a cargo van and come to Costco? Yeah, yeah, I'm a streamer, remember? I'm planning a big giveaway."

The installation workers sent a message saying the bulletproof glass was replaced. Without a second thought, I paid them and added, "The local health situation is getting tricky again, guys. Buy more food to keep at home."

My dad would be here soon, which meant I could buy even more things. So, I immediately left my unpaid items with a store associate, asking them to watch it, and then pushed a shopping cart to start a new round of purchases:
