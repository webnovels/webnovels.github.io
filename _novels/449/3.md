I watched their little back-and-forth act, feeling like I was watching two clowns putting on a desperate performance.

The wall clock pointed to 7:30 PM. Ethan should arrive in about half an hour.

Thinking about finally going home, I couldn't even be bothered to get angry. I just curled my lips into a faint smile.

"You want me to wash them? Sure!"

With that, I yanked the filthy sheets off the bed and flung them straight into Yvette's face.

Then, taking advantage of her panicked screaming, I dragged her towards the washing machine.

My actions caught Lucas off guard. He didn't react for a moment.

The next second, I roughly shoved both Yvette and the sheets into the washing machine.

"Dirty things should be washed together!"

"Ah! Aria, you bitch! Let go of me!" Yvette shrieked, kicking and flailing.

I easily grabbed her wrist. Five years of housework had made me much stronger than this pampered woman.

Lucas finally reacted, rushing over and kicking me hard in the abdomen. The force was so great it knocked me to the ground.

He then fished Yvette out of the washing machine and held her in his arms.

Yvette cried in his arms, looking utterly pitiful. "Lucas, darling, how could she do this to me? My wrist hurts so much..."

Lucas glared at me, his eyes full of fury. "Aria, I really underestimated you!"

I lay on the ground clutching my stomach, cold sweat beading on my forehead from the pain.

His face contorted with rage. "Stop pretending! I just kicked you once."

Then he viciously stomped on my wrist. The bones made an ominous creaking sound under the pressure.

"Ah!"

The excruciating pain made me cry out involuntarily.

Lucas leaned down, his eyes as sharp as knives.

"Apologize to Yvette right now. Say you were wrong! Otherwise, I'll cripple this hand of yours today!"

Yvette stood to the side, still wiping her crocodile tears. "Lucas, darling, make her kneel and lick my shoes. Then I'll forgive her."

"You heard her? Yvette's giving you a chance."

Lucas said, pressing down even harder with his foot.

I gritted my teeth, enduring the intense pain as tears streamed down my face uncontrollably.

Not from the pain, but from the utter absurdity of these past five years.

Ethan, where are you?

Your young miss is about to be bullied to death!

Just then, an enraged voice rang out.

"Who dares to bully our young miss!"

A dozen blinding headlights suddenly illuminated the entire courtyard.

A man in a black suit, tall and straight as a pine tree, stepped out of the lead car. Behind him was a row of bodyguards with stern expressions.

The ferocity on Lucas's face instantly froze, turning into shock.

Ethan strode over in a few quick steps and kicked Lucas flying.

Then he took off his suit jacket and gently draped it over my shoulders, covering my disheveled state.

He knelt on one knee, carefully cradling my bruised hand.

His eyes, as he looked at me, were filled with the tenderness of someone who had lost and regained a priceless treasure.

"Young miss," his voice trembled slightly with excitement.

"I've come to take you home."
