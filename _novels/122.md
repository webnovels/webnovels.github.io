My fiancée had always prided herself on her excellent memory. Yet she forgot to hold out her hand for the diamond ring during the proposal, forgot to bring her ID to get our marriage license, and on our wedding day, she forgot to show up altogether.

She was too busy saving her childhood friend's wedding next door.

When my mother saw this, she had a heart attack on the spot. I begged my fiancée to come explain things at my mother's hospital bed. Instead, she sweetly linked arms with her childhood friend's mother, calling her "Mom" and claiming I was just a persistent suitor who wouldn't leave her alone.

Later, I handled my mother's funeral arrangements alone and applied for an overseas work assignment.

As I was packing up to leave, my fiancée returned from her honeymoon with her childhood friend, looking blissfully happy. With a smile in her eyes, she said:

"Jack, how is your mother doing? Let's set a new wedding date to make her happy."

She didn't know that from the moment my mother died, there was no longer any possibility between us.
