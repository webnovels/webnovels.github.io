When Blair Vaughn credited the multi-billion-dollar project I architected to her newly promoted assistant for the ninth time, I submitted my resignation.
Everywhere she was, I chose absence.
When she gave her star interview on Bloomberg, I had every monitor in the executive lounge shut down. When she braved a Nor'easter to deliver me a latte, I instructed security to keep her outside the lobby doors. Hearing she canceled three video conferences with international funds just to corner me, I immediately booked a first-class flight to a secluded villa in Montauk.
I blocked her number, unfollowed her on every social platform, and formatted the hard drive that held ten years of our memories.
The twenty-year-old me helped her highlight textbooks in a crowded university library. The twenty-five-year-old me shared instant ramen with her in her startup’s cramped office. The thirty-year-old me finally learned to pour the cold coffee down the drain.
That same night I was publicly branded, for the ninth time, as the desperate social climber looking for an undeserved step-up, I kept vigil over a cold dinner and saw the photo of her and her assistant kissing. Ten years of ‘us against the world’had become a pathetic joke.
But that’s fine. Waking up now is better than never.

“Ms. Vaughn, there’s persistent market buzz that Vaughn Capital’s legendary performance is actually the result of the genius of former Chief Analyst, Landon Reed. What is your response to this, especially given his recent departure?”
At the Annual Titan of the Year Summit, Blair, thanks to her explosive growth metrics, had become the youngest CEO to ever grace the magazine cover. When questioned about our relationship, she smiled elegantly into the camera:
“We had a professional, employer-employee relationship. He is no longer with the firm.” Her expression hardened slightly. “As for the rumor that I was his fiancée, I would hope certain individuals would recognize their position and not indulge in too much fantasy.”
Outside, the city lights flared to life. I leaned back on the sofa, watching the wall clock.
Four hours. Blair still hadn’t called.
Just yesterday, the firm’s valuation had passed the fifty-billion-dollar mark. Wild with triumph, she’d wrapped her arms around me and called me her lucky charm. She promised, this time for sure, that she would formally introduce me as her fiancé at the summit.
My heart had nearly burst with a joy I hadn't felt in years. I’d asked her nine times before to go public, and nine times she’d promised and then found an excuse. This was the first time she’d initiated it.
Full of eager anticipation, I’d helped her polish her speech. The next day, she delivered a fatal blow in front of every major financial news outlet. She followed it up by replacing my profile picture with Nolan Scott’s on the founder’s page of the company website, sealing my permanent exit.
My phone screen flickered, illuminating the headline: #TheSocialClimber’sDelusion trending at the top of the finance news feed. My fingers stiffly tapped the link. The comments section was flooded with thousands of replies, each one dripping with contempt and mockery.
[LOL, if I remember correctly, this is the ninth time Landon Reed has been rumored to be the ‘genius behind the curtain,’ right?]
[He really thought he could climb the ladder and bag the elite CEO. Doesn’t he ever look in the mirror? Who does he think he is!]
[Blair has been dropping hints for months that he’d stop at nothing to get ahead. Now that she’s clarified, maybe some people will finally take a hint!]
[Landon needs to check out the gala photos. Nolan Scott, the new VP, that’s the pedigree who deserves our Investment Queen.]
I followed the link to a story titled “The Golden Couple: A Perfect Pairing.”
The accompanying photo showed Blair and Nolan standing intimately close. Under the gleam of a crystal chandelier, she was looking up at him, radiant, as they shared a celebratory toast with intertwined arms.
Seeing that, a sharp, searing pain shot through my chest, and the blood in my veins felt like it had turned to ice.
The celebration dinner, prepared for her, was ice-cold on the dining table, a mirror of my own heart.
As I rose to scrape the spoiled food into the disposal, the digital lock on the apartment door chirped.
Our eyes met. Blair immediately rushed into my arms, her tone carrying her usual practiced coyness: “I’m so sorry, Landon. The board insisted on a last-minute emergency session. They wouldn't let me leave.”
That same excuse.
Every broken promise, every late arrival, the same tired script. She seemed to forget that I built this company for her, and no one—no one—had the authority to keep her from me.
All my fight had drained away. I couldn't even bother to argue.
Her gaze fell on the table. She frowned slightly, displeasure coloring her voice: “What have you been doing all afternoon? This is last night’s food. Why haven’t you cleaned it up yet?”
A bitter, metallic taste coated my tongue. I mechanically forced a small smile.
“You told me yesterday you were coming home to celebrate, and asked me to have everything ready for you.”
She froze, then her expression morphed into a look of contrived remorse and a coaxing smile. That lasted only until I asked, "Were you really in a board meeting?"
Her face immediately darkened.
“Landon, what is that supposed to mean? It was a simple omission. Just because your name wasn’t mentioned, are you really going to act like this? Are you interrogating me?”
Her face was etched with faint fury. In the past, the mere sight of that expression would have made me instantly surrender. I would have been terrified of upsetting her.
Now, I only felt exhausted.
“The news online. I saw it.”
That single statement made her pause. She gave a cold, dismissive laugh.
“It’s all for the funding round. The firm needs a fresh narrative, a new buzz to keep attracting outside attention.” She waved her hand dismissively. “Besides, why are you being so petty about an assistant?”
Having been in this circle for so long, I understood packaging and marketing. But within the empire I had meticulously crafted for her, I could not tolerate my hard work being so carelessly handed to another.
Looking at her entitled, unapologetic face, I abandoned the argument. I walked to the counter, gathered the gifts I had prepared for her, and, one by one, dumped them into the trash can in front of her.
As I pulled the door shut to leave, I heard her furious, panicked voice:
“Don’t you dare come crawling back and beg me to marry you later!”
I didn’t pause.
I wouldn’t. Never again.
In the elevator, I stared blankly at the rapidly descending numbers. My phone buzzed. It was Nolan Scott. Against my better judgment, I answered.
[Landon, thanks. Blair loved the model optimization. From now on, just forward all your creative designs straight to me. It saves Blair the trouble of having to forward them again.]
[Oh, and I appreciate everything you’ve done for Blair and the firm. Don't worry, we'll definitely be sending you an invitation to the wedding. Best man, maybe?]
Even though I had fully expected the venom in his voice, my heart still twisted with dull pain.
Blair and I met in college. Though she came from a modest background, I never judged her for it. At twenty, we were hopelessly in love. I sacrificed my offer from a top Wall Street investment bank to help her start her company. At twenty-three, she accepted my proposal. I thought I had secured our entire future. At twenty-five, when her company gained momentum, I turned down every outside job offer to be the silent architect behind her success.
Ten years of mutual support. In the eyes of the financial world, we were the perfect, formidable pair.
But the moment she hired a male assistant, everything soured. She began to deliberately distance herself from me in public and blur the lines of our partnership. Despite our long-standing engagement, she strictly forbade anyone inside the company from knowing about it. After repeated attempts to get her to commit, she finally promised me a formal title once the firm crossed the fifty-billion-dollar valuation this year.
Instead, to promote her new protégé, she systematically transferred my credit—over and over—until I became known as the calculating social climber of the industry.
My phone vibrated again. I thought it was spam and went to delete it, but it was my private attorney, Mr. Wallace.
“Mr. Reed, Ms. Vaughn’s new equity raise plan is ready to launch. Should I submit the documents naming you as a key partner to the board?”
“Scrap that.”
Wallace was silent for a moment, then asked tentatively, “Do you mean... you want to add more favorable terms?”
“Liquidate all my passively held shares and instruct the legal department to initiate intellectual property protection proceedings for my core investment strategy models.”
My 180-degree turn seemed to stun the lawyer into silence. Everyone knew I was Blair’s most loyal anchor.
Fearing her funding would dry up, I poured in all my personal savings and network connections. Fearing her decisions would falter, I worked through the night doing data analysis and risk forecasting for her. To the outside world, I was a nameless analyst. But to her, I offered my brilliance and my entire playbook without reservation.
In front of the board, she once dismissively commented: "Without my platform to execute them, his strategies are nothing but a pile of worthless data."
I was naive enough then to believe it was just posturing, a tactic to consolidate her own authority. Now I understood. For ten years, I was merely the sharpest knife in her drawer.
“From now on, I don’t need to be informed of anything regarding Vaughn Capital. Handle everything strictly according to commercial law.”
The next day, I returned to the apartment to collect my personal belongings. As I reached the study door, I heard soft laughter from within.
The door was slightly ajar. Blair had her back to me, straddling Nolan Scott, whispering sweetly.
Nolan saw me but showed no sign of alarm. Instead, he twisted Blair’s face toward him and kissed her with calculated, languid passion right in front of me. When he pulled away, he intentionally baited her: “Blair, if you keep passing me Landon’s analysis, he’s going to get upset with you again!”
Blair leaned back in his arms, her voice dripping with contempt. “What is he? He’s just a tool.”
“I’ve been bored with him for years. If I didn’t still need him, I would have tossed him out of the firm ages ago. He just analyzes the data. Give him a little sweet talk, and he’d give me his life.”
I bit the soft inner cheek of my mouth. The bitter taste of my own blood couldn't override the cold, searing bitterness that filled my chest. Years of total commitment, the sweetest memories—each one was a boomerang of pain, slicing deep into my heart.
My last flicker of hope died.
The conversation inside continued. Nolan looked at me through the gap in the door, his eyes full of malice.
“Blair, do you think Landon will get so depressed he’ll try to hurt himself when he sees the photos of us?”
Blair chuckled and kissed Nolan’s cheek.
“You’re the one to talk. You intentionally let the media see us. You just had to use a headline to cut him off completely.” She ran her fingers through his hair. “You’re so wicked.”
“Do you like it?”
Nolan deliberately moved his hips, eliciting a playful gasp and laugh from Blair.
I didn't need to see any more. I walked to the elevator. My phone flashed an alert from my security app. I had accidentally triggered the voice recording function on the way in.
No wonder a strange playfulness had always been in her eyes whenever she finally promised me a formal title.
I called my lawyer’s assistant to arrange the collection of my private items and put the apartment on the market. I also forwarded the damning voice recording to Wallace for evidence.
I wanted no more ties to Blair Vaughn.
My car had just pulled up to my private studio building when a text from Blair came through.
[So, you send your lawyer to beg for peace? Where’s all that backbone from yesterday?]
[I refused to see him. I want you to come over personally and apologize to me, and then fix the European deal you messed up. Only then will I consider this over.]
A few days ago, I would have instantly complied. For her, I would have done anything, given her everything I owned.
Now, I simply replied with three words:
[Legal documents attached.]
Blair likely assumed I had sent a long, groveling list of gifts for her to choose from, as in the past. Her next message was even more brazen:
[Oh, so you do have the nerve to throw away my gifts? And now you’re begging to make up? I saw a few pricey auction pieces lately, but you did make me angry, so they’ll cost you extra, darling ~]
I didn't bother to reply, blocking her number instead.
My lawyer messaged me: The apartment found a buyer immediately; the transfer would be quick. I nodded and entered my studio to catch up on the backlog of work.
I didn't expect Blair, with Nolan in tow, to storm the building.
She was stopped by the front desk and furious.
“Do you know who I am? How dare you block me?” she spat. “Get your boss out here! If he’s not standing in front of me in three minutes, there will be consequences.”
She was barking orders, clearly still unaware that I had completely severed ties. The receptionist, following my instructions, did not budge.
Blair’s fury ignited. “You wait right there, I’ll have Landon fire you! Your boss practically works for me—how dare you stop me?” She pulled out her phone, only to realize my number wouldn't connect.
She froze, a rare flicker of panic in her eyes. It was at that moment I happened to be walking toward the elevator bank to leave for a meeting.
Nolan immediately pointed. “Isn’t that Landon Reed? I knew he couldn’t really ignore you, Blair. He's just trying the hard-to-get act to make you come to him.”
Blair instantly regained her composure. She marched up to me, rage fueling her stride. “Landon Reed, are you insane?! There’s a limit to a temper tantrum. You dare screen my calls? I’ll ruin you in this entire sector!”
She raised her hand to point a finger at my face, but my attorney, standing behind me, caught her wrist and quietly warned her to show respect.
I looked at her with cold indifference. “I’d like to see you try.”
Blair looked utterly shocked that I would speak to her this way. “What did you say?”
Nolan quickly tried to mediate. “Landon, don’t be stubborn. You know you’ll just have to beg Blair to take you back later.”
Blair sneered at this. “You’d better think carefully. If you burn this bridge completely, you won't have another chance to be my lapdog.” She stepped closer. “I’ll even be generous. Kneel right now, in front of everyone, apologize, and transfer the shares of this pathetic little studio to me. I’ll forgive you.”
I stared at her greedy, grasping expression, feeling a momentary disorientation. How had I been so blind, so stupid, to love this person?
Blair, misinterpreting my silence as fear, became more arrogant. “Don’t forget, all your contacts and your so-called reputation are built on the back of Vaughn Capital’s platform. Without me, you are nothing!”
“If you don't agree, I’ll issue a company-wide announcement immediately, ensuring you never work in finance again!”
She was convinced she had me cornered. Nolan fanned the flames: “Come on, Landon. Just suck it up. Without Blair’s platform, you’re just trash that no one would hire, not even to fetch coffee.”
They made me laugh. I let out a genuine chuckle. “That sounds marvelous.”
Blair was stunned by my reaction. “What did you say?”
I raised my hand and took a document from my attorney, then flung it onto Blair’s chest.
“Vaughn Capital was merely an experiment, a sandbox where I realized a youthful ambition. If I choose to, I can build ten more firms, a hundred more.”
“As for your platform, I am the platform. As for the blacklist? Perfect. Let's start tallying the damages.”
Blair’s face went instantly pale. She stared at me in disbelief, as if I were a complete stranger.
