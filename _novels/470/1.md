As an heiress, Chloe lived in a luxury townhouse with top-notch security.

Devin immediately sent his team to check the surveillance footage, while he, Asher, and I headed straight for Chloe’s private residence.

The moment we reached the door, a strong metallic smell of blood hit us.

I shivered, a chilling premonition gripping me.

My breathing became shallow. I reached into my bag for the key, but the more nervous I got, the less I could do anything right. The key, which was usually in the outer pocket of my backpack, was nowhere to be found.

As if sensing my fear, Asher gently wrapped his arms around me from behind, softly reassuring me, “Aubrey, don’t be scared. I’m here.”

I took a few deep breaths, forcing myself to stay calm, and finally found the key, handing it to Devin.

Devin shot me an annoyed look, probably thinking I was too slow. Without a word, he turned and unlocked the door.

Chloe’s house was dark. The pungent, sickening smell in the air made it hard for me to breathe. I stared at the closed door, an inexplicable dread filling me, as if a flesh-eating monster would leap out of that dark doorway any second.

I clung tightly to Asher’s arm, as if it could bring me some peace.

The door opened. Devin went in first, fumbling to switch on the living room light.

Still reeling, I looked at the center of the living room. This scene, I will never forget.

Chloe was dead.

In her own living room, in a terribly gruesome state.

She was kneeling, crucified, her face slashed beyond recognition, and her body stabbed countless times. Blood was everywhere.

I screamed, terrified, and almost collapsed.

Thankfully, Asher caught me in time and pulled out the pills he always carried, handing them to me.

After taking the medication, I felt a little better, but I was still sobbing uncontrollably.

“It’s all my fault. I came too late. If only I had come sooner.”

Devin stood a short distance away, glaring at me irritably. “The killer is extremely brutal. If you had come sooner, there’d only be one more body.”

I flinched.

Devin’s words were as cutting as ever.

Still, good to know he hadn’t changed.

The police quickly secured the scene, taping it off.

The officer who went to check the surveillance footage came back empty-handed. “The surrounding cameras were destroyed.”

I sat blankly on the steps outside the door, a wave of numbness washing over me.

My best friend, brutally murdered in her own home. It was hard for anyone to accept.

Just as I was lost in thought, a fluffy head suddenly appeared in front of my face, scaring the living daylights out of me. Thankfully, Asher was still by my side and immediately pulled me into his arms.

“Buddy! Back!” Devin called out sharply.

That’s when I saw it clearly: it was a police dog.

“Excuse me, Aubrey is afraid of dogs. Could you please keep your dog on a tighter leash?”

I heard Asher’s displeased voice.

Devin, holding the dog’s leash, shot me a thoughtful glance.

I guessed he was probably wondering when I became afraid of dogs.

After all, when we were dating back then, we even adopted a puppy together.

But people change.

As the person who reported the crime, Devin questioned me privately as standard procedure.

“What was your relationship with the deceased, Chloe Chen?”

“She was my best friend.”

I thought, Devin should know the answer to that question without asking. The three of us were middle school classmates, and Chloe and I had been closest ever since then.

More than just my best friend, she was my *only* friend.
