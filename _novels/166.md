At the company's IPO press conference, my husband glanced at his secretary.

I turned and walked away, making an appointment for an abortion.

Simultaneously, I asked a lawyer to draft a divorce agreement.

Jasper received the email and called me, his voice filled with anger.

"Are you serious? Just because I glanced at Fiona?"

"Yes, just because you glanced at her."
