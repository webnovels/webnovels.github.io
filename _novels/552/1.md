The printer spit out the final page of the divorce agreement. I stared at it for a long time, a few tears escaping.

I never imagined the love in this life would dissipate so quickly.

I put the papers away, opened my phone, and saw an Ins video notification.

It was Seraphina, the dancer, and it already had thousands of likes.

In the video, Dax embraced her from behind, his chin resting intimately on her shoulder as he pointed at a limited edition Iron Man model, explaining something in a low voice.

The video title read: "My Alpha CEO's Secret Toy Collection, Worth $10 Million, And Only I'm Allowed In!"

My breath hitched.

I remembered that global limited edition model; he and I had pulled three all-nighters to assemble it.

The moment we finished, we were as happy as kids with candy.

He took my hand and gently placed it on the Iron Man’s metal palm.

"Elara, this room, and everything in it, is our private fortress. The key is only for you."

A heavy knot formed in my chest at the thought.

In my past life, he had broken countless rules for me.

He'd canceled multi-billion dollar international meetings just to watch a midnight animated film with me.

He hated animal fur and noise, yet he silently allowed me to keep that shedding, yappy Corgi.

He never believed in ghosts or gods, but when I was sick, he knelt outside a sacred shrine for a day and a night, praying for my recovery.

I gripped the divorce papers tightly and walked straight to that collection room.

I didn't need permission; I had supreme access. He'd promised me that himself.

The door wasn't locked.

The moment I pushed it open, languid music washed over me. I froze.

In the center of the room, a long pole had been erected at some point.

And Dax, sitting on the very couch we had chosen together, was watching that dancer sway on the pole.

With a shriek, Seraphina slipped hard from the pole, falling onto the carpet.

Her short skirt flew up, revealing she wore absolutely nothing underneath.

A glaring red mark had appeared on the inner side of her pale thigh.

Dax, without a second thought, knelt down, sucking on the wound. His movements were incredibly gentle.

I let out a bitter laugh.

When he satisfied me, he'd only use those cold toys, like a cold, unfeeling surgeon.

But for her, he could kneel so devotedly, kissing her with his own lips.
