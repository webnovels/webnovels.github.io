Just because she lost a game of Truth or Dare, my wife was passionately kissing her assistant in my car. The moisture even soaked my son’s car seat.

The male assistant sent me the video, and I immediately forwarded it to my wife.

"Going broke, Seraphina? Cheating in *my* car now?"

She sent a voice message back, her tone laced with drunken charm. "This was an arranged marriage, Julian. Did you actually think I was *your* wife? It was just a dare! Are you seriously that petty?!"

I scoffed. It was time to make her understand.

You do something you shouldn't, you pay the price.
