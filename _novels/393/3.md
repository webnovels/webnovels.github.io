Pushing the door open, I saw Marcus and Vanessa entangled on the sofa, in a very intimate embrace.

I quickly covered my daughter’s eyes and ears.

Marcus angrily picked up a nearby water glass and threw it at me.

“Get out! Who let you in? Is this a place for a beggar like you?!”

The glass hit my forehead, and the pain made my vision swim.

Before I could even recover,

Several project managers rushed in, politely apologizing to Marcus.

“We’re truly sorry, Mr. Sterling. We were negligent. We’ll take her out immediately.”

Furious, I shook off the person holding me and shouted, “This is *my* lounge! What right do you have to kick me out?”

The scene fell into a sudden silence.

Then, a few people started laughing.

Seeing they didn’t believe me, I was about to pull out my phone to prove myself.

But Marcus rushed over, snatched my phone, and violently smashed it on the floor. The screen shattered into several pieces.

Before I could speak,

He sneered coldly, “Have you been dreaming for too long? Is your mind not clear? This lounge is exclusively for Caleb Hayes, one of the wealthiest men in the country. Even I can only sit here to discuss business. Who do you think you are, spouting such nonsense?”

“You’ve gone this far to seduce me. You really have no shame.”

A few stout middle-aged men eyed me with strange looks.

“Mr. Sterling, who is this woman?”

Marcus chuckled coldly, casually saying, “Don’t know her. But looking at her, she’s probably selling herself, isn’t she?”

Vanessa leaned against him, giggling, her fingers tracing circles on his chest. “Marcus, you’re so mean to my sister.”

After hearing Marcus ruthlessly humiliate me,

The project managers’ faces immediately twisted with disgust. A barrage of nasty comments followed.

“This kind of woman actually dares to come here and seduce Mr. Sterling, and with a child! She has no shame. Be careful not to catch anything.”

“With your pathetic appearance, you can’t do anything else. You might as well go beg for food.”

“We’ve seen plenty of women like you. They’re full of tricks, willing to do anything for money. If Mr. Sterling doesn’t want her, you can give her to me to play with. I haven’t seen a piece of trash like this in ages.”

I kept my daughter tightly hugged, not letting her hear those vulgar words.

“Don’t go too far! There’s a child here!”

But it still scared Lily. The little girl cried out.

Marcus seemed to think it had gone a bit too far. His face darkened, and he roared, “Who told you to talk like that? Are you looking to die?!”

The men exchanged glances and quickly shut up.

I ignored him, focusing on comforting my daughter in my arms.

Just as I finally managed to calm her down,

I looked up and saw Marcus staring at me thoughtfully, a hint of complexity in his eyes.

He seemed about to say something, but Vanessa spoke first, putting on a generous and gentle facade:

“Sister Aurora, it must have been hard for you raising a child alone all these years. My body is still recovering, and I just happen to need a nanny. Why don’t you come and take care of me? I’ll pay you two thousand five hundred a month. It’s much better than picking up trash outside.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Marcus pulled her close and kissed her deeply on the lips.

“Vanessa, you’re so considerate. You really break my heart.”

Vanessa blushed and buried her head in his chest.

Watching them being so sickeningly sweet, I felt goosebumps all over my body. Suppressing my disgust, I refused:

“Thank you for your kind offer, but I really like my current job.”

With that, I ignored Marcus’s grim face, hugged my daughter, and walked straight out.

These two lunatics. If I can’t deal with them, I can at least avoid them, right?

Behind me, I heard the sound of things smashing, mixed with Marcus’s furious roar:

“Aurora Hayes, are you really that useless? You’re still a complete failure, aren’t you? And you still think you can remarry me? No way!”

I slammed the door shut.
