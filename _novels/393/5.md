As my voice echoed.

Everyone’s faces instantly changed.

Then, piercing laughter erupted.

“Hahaha, Mr. Sterling, what is this woman spouting? If she’s Mrs. Hayes, then I must be the richest person in the world! Are you serious? Is she out of her mind?!”

“What nonsense! Everyone knows Mr. Hayes’s wife is a beautiful, elegant woman. This tramp, picking up garbage, thinks she can compare?”

“Yeah, and the Hayes family only has one young master. That little girl beside her isn’t even fit to carry Mr. Hayes’s son’s shoes.”

Amidst the noisy laughter, Marcus grabbed me and yanked me off the ground.

“Aurora Hayes, you really don’t prepare your lies, do you? Someone as high-and-mighty as Caleb Hayes, do you think he’d even glance at a woman like you, a woman I tossed aside?”

Marcus’s eyes were full of contempt, as if I were a piece of dirt on the ground.

“I was actually wondering if you were genuinely remorseful, if I could take you back. But it turns out you’re not only unrepentant, you’re also trying to cling to Mr. Hayes. Aurora Hayes, your very essence is worse than this trash. No matter how much you wash, you’re still garbage.”

Before he finished speaking, Marcus picked up a nearby garbage can and dumped it over my head.

The putrid smell quickly enveloped me, making me gag.

The surrounding managers pinched their noses and laughed.

“Well done! That’s how you teach people like her a lesson.”

One man offered a suggestion.

“Mr. Sterling, rumor has it that Mr. Hayes is extremely protective of his wife. If he knew someone was impersonating his wife, he certainly wouldn’t let her off easily. I know there’s a cold storage nearby. Let’s lock her in there and let Mr. Hayes deal with her personally when he arrives. Then our collaboration project will surely be a go.”

Looking at this group of ugly-faced people, my heart filled with hatred.

Marcus stared at me and sighed.

“Aurora Hayes, I’m giving you one last chance to apologize. Just kneel down and apologize to Vanessa in public, and I’ll let you go. Otherwise…”

“You wish!”

Seeing my defiance, Marcus’s expression turned completely cold.

He gave a look, and several burly men immediately swarmed me, binding my hands and feet before tossing me into the cold storage.

In the freezing cold storage, below ten degrees Celsius, my entire body quickly became covered in frost.

A strong will to survive made me incessantly bang on the door, desperately scratching at the metal with all my might. My nails were ripped off, exposing raw, bloody flesh.

My daughter cried out for Mommy from outside, only to be slapped several times.

“Who do you call ‘Mommy’? From now on, *I’m* your only mommy! You little thing!”

Seeing Lily continue to cry uncontrollably, Vanessa simply stuffed a foul-smelling rag into her mouth.

Suddenly, a roaring sound came from a distance. A black Maybach screeched to a halt beside them.

A pair of perfectly tailored long legs stepped onto the ground, and a custom suit outlined the cold, handsome figure of the newcomer.

He was holding a cute little boy in his arms.

In the split second before my consciousness faded, I heard someone shriek:

“Mr. Hayes and the young master are here!”


Caleb Hayes stepped out of the car, holding his son.

He looked around, but couldn’t spot the familiar figure he was searching for.
