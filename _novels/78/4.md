Rachel is no longer the kind-hearted person she once was. The scam organization is not a good place; it's a living hell.

She has sunk deeper and deeper, even her heart has grown cold and hard.

She doesn't care if my mother is paralyzed in bed or if my father is disabled. She only wants money.

When she swings the knife to cut off my parents' limbs, I am completely devastated.

Rachel watches the people lying in pools of blood with an expressionless face. She waves her hand to call her subordinates, "Find a back-alley doctor to give them a couple of shots. As long as they don't die, it's fine."

I keep shouting in rage, passing through her body.

I want to strangle her.

She's not human anymore. I'm the one who did wrong, why do my parents have to bear the consequences?

Watching my parents being carelessly given a couple of shots to stop the bleeding and then left there, I break down. I wish I could be the one lying there, hovering between life and death. No matter how cruel, as long as my parents are okay.

"Boss, this needle was just used by a drug addict. Is that okay?" the shady doctor rubs his hands, looking a bit embarrassed.

I rush over to punch that shameless face. Our family can't afford to treat AIDS now. He's going to kill my parents.

Rachel smiles, "It's fine. They're old anyway. Without hands and feet, they won't live for many more years."

She takes a drag on her cigarette.

"Whatever medicine you use, make sure they live for at least a year."

I know why she says this. Because in the past, I would see her at least once a year.

After failing to get into the police academy, she thought I was working outside.

But that wasn't true. I was undercover.

So she never knew my real identity.

Actually, I wish I had really failed back then. Then I wouldn't have had to watch her go down the wrong path.

I really made a mistake.

I betrayed her for myself, and then betrayed my oath for her. In the end, I lost everything.

This must be my retribution.

Looking at my parents' pale faces from blood loss and the empty spaces where their hands and feet should be, I desperately pound my head. I'm not a good son. I wish they had never given birth to me. Then they wouldn't have to suffer such a cruel fate in their old age.

I don't know how long it's been, but my father regains consciousness. Seeing Rachel, he trembles with anger, unable to utter a word.

"What's wrong, uncle? Did you have a stroke in your old age?" Rachel asks mockingly.

"That's too bad. Do you have money for treatment? I'm afraid you can only wait for death now."

She laughs wildly, then covers her mouth in mock surprise.

"Oh my, I forgot to tell you, uncle. The needle used for the injection might have been used by a drug addict before. Who knows if you'll get sick?"

"Isn't that terrible? It seems you can't afford treatment anyway."

Rachel shakes her head in feigned pity.

My father's eyes bulge with rage. He wants to fight her to the death but can't move an inch. He can only stare at her fiercely, but when he sees my mother beside him, tears start to fall.

I've never seen my father cry before. This is the first time. He struggles to move his body closer to my mother, leaning against her and silently weeping.

Tears fall from his aged face, his already graying hair now even whiter.

Rachel narrows her eyes, "Uncle, don't blame me for being heartless. How about this? If you apologize for what happened before, I'll give you a dose of preventive medicine. How about that?"

She stands still, clearly wanting my father to crawl to her feet.

I've seen through her now. She's a complete psychopath, a cold-blooded monster.

No matter how much I want to help my father, I can only helplessly pass through him.

Watching him struggle to get off the bed, falling heavily to the ground, only able to slowly crawl towards Rachel's feet with his remaining limbs, leaving a long trail of blood.

"I beg you, please..."

"Uncle, your voice is too soft. I can't hear you. Why don't you lift your head?" Rachel says maliciously.

My father trembles as he lifts his head, in a ridiculous posture.

But my mother can't laugh. Already weak, seeing her husband in such a humiliating state, coupled with the massive blood loss, she faints.

My father turns back to see this and lets out a heart-wrenching cry, trying to rush over to her.

Rachel impatiently covers her ears, "What's wrong with you? Why are you screaming so horribly? Hey, don't let them die."

The doctor who had been watching from the side goes over to save them.

Rachel purses her lips in boredom and walks out in her high heels.
