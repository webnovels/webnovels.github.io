That day marked the beginning of the end.

The man who had once claimed he didn't like children began studying pregnancy guides religiously. Gus Manning personally accompanied Rose Walsh to every prenatal appointment and carefully decorated the nursery. 

When the fire broke out, he didn't hesitate for a second before scooping Rose into his arms and rushing toward safety.

"Gus!" Amara Pierce's voice came out hoarse and desperate as flames devoured her words. "Save me… I'm here..."

Gus' footsteps seemed to falter for just a moment. Their eyes met briefly through the thick smoke, and Amara saw a flash of internal conflict cross his face.

But in the next instant, Rose clutched his hand tightly. "Mr. Manning, please get us out of here. I'm so scared…"

"Don't be afraid." Gus' voice was tender in a way that cut through Amara like a blade. "I'm here. Our family of three will be safe."

Our family of three. Those four words plunged into Amara's heart like a knife.

As Gus shielded Rose and rushed toward the exit, another burning beam crashed down, striking Amara squarely in the back. In the final moment before losing consciousness, her mind drifted back to the car accident five years ago.

It had been raining heavily that day. She and Gus had just left the restaurant when an out-of-control truck mounted the sidewalk. Almost instinctively, she had pushed Gus out of harm's way.

Sharp pain had spread from her abdomen throughout her entire body, and she could hear Gus screaming her name with soul-crushing anguish. When she woke up, the doctor delivered devastating news that her uterus had been severely damaged, and she would never be able to conceive.

"We should break up," she had said on the day of her discharge, her eyes red-rimmed with tears. "You're the only son of the Manning family. You need an heir."

How had Gus responded then? He had pressed her against the hospital room wall and kissed her until she couldn't breathe.

"Amara, I only want you. If we can't have children, we'll be child-free. I can handle my family."

To convince his family, he had fought them for hours. His mother had cried, calling it a disgrace, while his father had stormed out in fury. In the end, his grandfather had simply sighed and said to let him make his own mistakes.

Through the blazing heat, Amara could almost see Gus lifting her wedding veil again, his eyes red-rimmed with emotion as he had whispered, "Amara, you're the only one I'll ever want in this lifetime."

And now there he was, holding another woman in his arms, speaking of their family of three.

The flames consumed Amara's final thread of consciousness. Fine, then. This time, she would truly let them have their perfect family.

…

When Amara woke again, she found herself staring at the stark white ceiling of a hospital room.

"Amara, you're awake." Gus' voice came from beside her bed. She turned her head to see his bloodshot eyes and deeply furrowed brows.

"Does it still hurt?" His voice was tight with concern as his fingers gently traced her cheek.

"The doctor said you have minor burns and a concussion, but don't worry. I've gotten you a private room and the best doctors. You won't have any scars…"

Amara stared at his concerned expression and suddenly found it laughable. The same man who had chosen his "family of three" without hesitation in that burning building was now putting on this act of devotion?

She opened her mouth, her throat burning with pain. "Gus, let's get div—"

"Amara," he suddenly interrupted, placing a document in front of her. "Let's get divorced."

Amara's entire body went rigid. Though she had been about to suggest divorce herself, she hadn't expected him to bring it up first.

"It's just temporary," he said quickly, as if he'd rehearsed this speech.

"Rose has about a month left before she gives birth, and my family's lawyers say the child needs legitimate status for inheritance rights. Once the child is born and the legal paperwork is settled, I'll divorce her, and then we can—"

"Remarry?" Amara whispered, completing his sentence as her heart felt crushed by an invisible fist.

"Yes!" His eyes lit up as if a weight had been lifted from his shoulders.

"I've already spoken with Rose about it. She'll take the money and leave after giving birth. As for the baby… we can just raise it as our own, right?"

Amara stared at his moving lips, her entire body turning cold.

"Amara?" he pressed. "Sign here. The lawyer is waiting to process the paperwork."

She took the pen, her fingertips trembling. The moment the pen touched the paper, a tear dropped onto the word "divorce", spreading into a wet stain. Gus seemed not to notice.

He collected the signed documents and leaned down to kiss her forehead, but she turned her head away. He froze for a moment, then straightened up as if nothing had happened. "Amara, just wait a little longer for me."

The door closed with a soft click, but it felt like a sledgehammer striking Amara's heart.

He wanted her to wait? She wouldn't wait anymore.

Amara pulled out her IV and dragged her aching body to handle the discharge procedures. She heard Gus' voice as she passed the maternity ward.

"Walk slowly and watch the steps." His tone was tenderly unfamiliar. "The doctor said the baby is developing beautifully."

"Mr. Manning, touch it…" Rose's excited voice carried through the hallway. "The baby is kicking me!"

"Let me feel." Gus' voice carried laughter. "So active—it must be a boy."

"You want a boy?"

"I'd love either." His voice was gentle. "I've already chosen names. If it's a boy, Gabriel Manning. If it's a girl, Nina Manning."

Amara pressed herself against the cold wall, her nails digging deep into her palms. She remembered that rainy night five years ago when Gus had stood soaked beneath her apartment building, his eyes red from crying.

"Amara, if we can't have children, so be it. You're all I need. I don't even like children anyway."

And now there he was, bent down next to another woman, his eyes bright with anticipation as he listened to the baby's movements. He'd even chosen names for them already.

"Gus, oh, Gus. If you wanted children, why did you choose me in the first place? Why did you say you couldn't live without me? Why did you lie?" Amara murmured as she turned and walked away, tears streaming down her face. 

She made a call to her parents in the cab. "Dad, Mom, I want to come see you overseas."

Shock filled their voices on the other end. "What's wrong? Aren't you and Gus doing well? Did he hurt you?"

Amara's throat tightened. "No… We just don't love each other anymore."

She spoke softly, "We're ending things amicably."

After hanging up, the cab stopped in front of a legal services office.

"I need to arrange permanent relocation overseas," she said, walking inside and handing over her documents. "I want to close all my accounts and transfer everything."

The clerk looked up at her. "Are you certain? Once you relocate and we process the closures, there will be very little trace of you here."

Amara nodded. "I'm certain."

From that day forward, there would be no trace of her old life here.

"Gus, you got what you wanted," she thought. "I'm removing myself from your family of three."
