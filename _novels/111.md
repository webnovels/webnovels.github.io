My grandmother is the wealthiest person in Country A, and I'm her only granddaughter. Yet, my two brothers let their mistress take my place.

Before the centennial celebration of SkyRise Corporation began, Lydia took the seat meant for the corporation's daughter and feigned sincerity as she said to me,

"If it weren't for the brothers insisting I bring you out into the world, a poor student like you would never set foot in SkyRise Corporation."

"Make sure you behave later and don't cause trouble for me, or the brothers will have no mercy on you."

In my previous life, my brothers' threats made me timid and submissive to Lydia. But now, I've been reborn.

As Lydia continued her nonsense, I kicked her a meter away.

"Who do you think you are? Lecturing me like that!"
