I was born with the gift of prophecy. Whatever I say comes true.

When I first learned to speak, I babbled that my dad would become rich. That night, he won the lottery jackpot of $100 million.

When I was six, I said our neighbor's missing grandson would return home safely. The next day, he was found dirty but unharmed at the town entrance.

At eighteen, I commented online that the nearly bankrupt Chen Corporation would make a comeback against all odds. Sure enough, two weeks later, their stock prices skyrocketed, returning them to their former glory!

Because of my gift, I became an honored guest of the Harrison family. But as soon as I stepped into their mansion, someone grabbed me by my hair and dragged me across the floor.

"You slut! It's not enough that you seduced my fiancé outside, now you're throwing yourself at him in his own home? You must have a death wish!" a shrill voice accused.

Wrongly accused, I tried to explain, but they were convinced I was the other woman and began beating me mercilessly.

As my bracelet shattered with a crisp sound, I tasted the metallic tang of blood in my mouth.

What they didn't know was that besides my gift of prophecy, I also bore the curse of misfortune.

Whoever made me bleed would be plagued by bad luck. It seemed the Harrison family was destined for a complete downfall.
