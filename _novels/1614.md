The zombie outbreak began, and my new husband Julian died right before my eyes, killed while trying to protect me.

I fled in panic, taking desperate refuge in a desolate, abandoned construction site.

But the very next day, my parents called out of the blue. My mother Sarah had been hospitalized with a heart condition, and they insisted I come care for her.

I immediately told them about the zombie outbreak, urging them to find a safe place to hide.

Instead, my parents lashed out, yelling at me.

"What kind of zombie nonsense are you talking about? Have you been watching too many horror movies? Come up with a better excuse!"

I knew something was off. I wanted to go to the hospital where my parents were, just to check.

But I hadn't gone far before I was spotted by zombies on the street, and I was bitten to death!

When I opened my eyes again, I was back at the moment my parents had just called.

I carefully asked.

"Mom, Dad, are you safe? Is everything okay where you are?"

My parents swore it was.

"What could possibly go wrong at a hospital? Just hurry up and get here!"
