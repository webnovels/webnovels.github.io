The year my brother was born, my mother, Carol, established the “Family Trust Fund.”
Her rule was simple: “Every New Year’s Day, I’ll hide a coin in one of the special Croissant. Whoever finds it has to contribute to the fund for the year.”
And every year since then, I was the one who bit down on the cold metal.
It was a brilliant scheme to exploit me.
Every day, Mom would coo, “You are the luckiest child in this family, Jenna. Others wish they had your fortune!”
That lie—that I was blessed—coaxed me into paying for two decades.
It wasn’t until last year that I finally cleared the twenty-three years of accumulated debt.
I thought I could breathe again.
But then, Mom announced, “This year, the person who finds the coin contributes Fifty Thousand Dollars to the Family Trust.”
She’d barely finished the sentence when I bit into something hard.
The coin.
But this time, I didn't say a word. I swallowed it, hard, and acted like nothing happened.
I was done being the luckiest child in the family.

“Who found the coin this year?”
The moment Mom asked, her shrewd, calculating gaze snapped right to me.
As if she already knew the answer, she bypassed everyone else.
“Jenna, was it you?”
The coin was heavy in my mouth. I hesitated, then forced myself to swallow it down with a gulp of water, ignoring the slight scratch in my throat.
I smoothed the expression from my eyes and shook my head. “It wasn’t me.”
Mom’s face was a mask of disbelief, though she tried to laugh it off.
“Don’t be silly. It’s always you. How could this year be any different? Is the luckiest member of the family finally changing?”
She reached over and snatched my bowl, plunging her spoon into the few remaining Croissant. She poked and prodded them, and her expression swiftly moved from smug certainty to frantic alarm.
Her movements grew more agitated as she mumbled, “No way! Where is the coin?”
“I remember…”
She stopped herself midsentence and looked up at me, her face unnaturally bright as she offered a flimsy excuse.
“I mean, I remembered that it’s always you, so I was worried when I didn’t see it. I got a little jumpy.”
I wanted to laugh at her sudden desperation, but the emotion was too bitter.
I just offered a quiet, low “Mmhmm,” and stayed silent.
But she wasn't done. Even after ransacking my bowl, she pressed me again.
“Are you absolutely sure you didn’t get it, Jenna? Are you sure you didn’t just accidentally swallow it?”
The pain in my chest was a heavy, dull ache, as if a hand had reached in and was squeezing the air out of my lungs. I felt suffocated.
I didn’t answer her question directly. Instead, I leveled my gaze on hers and counter-attacked.
“Mom, why do you have to search my bowl? Why are you so certain it has to be mine?”
“Maybe it’s in yours, or Dad’s, or Jake’s?”
Mom finally lost her composure. Her eyes darted around the table, a clear sign she was genuinely starting to doubt if she’d rigged the wrong bowl.
Seeing her silence, I reached for my younger brother Jake’s bowl, preparing to search it.
Mom’s hand flew out and delivered a hard, sharp slap across my wrist. Her eyes were blazing with fierce protectiveness.
“Don’t you dare! Why would it be in his bowl?!”

My eyes stung with the sudden threat of tears.
Why wouldn’t it be in his bowl? Why does it have to be mine?
My voice trembled as I stubbornly pushed for the answer I knew I’d never get.
“Why is it impossible for it to be in my brother’s bowl?”
It was then she realized she’d overreacted. She plopped back into her chair, cleared her throat, and offered a dismissive explanation.
“Oh, what else? Your brother isn’t the lucky one. You are.”
My father, Richard, scowled and tossed his spoon back into his bowl, his voice clipped with impatience.
“So where is the damn coin, then?”
He paused, then his eyes narrowed into a focused, scrutinizing glare aimed straight at me.
“Jenna Johnson, you didn’t just hide the coin so you wouldn’t have to pay the fund, did you?”
My eyes flickered away for a fraction of a second, but my father was too sharp. He caught it.
He shot a look at Mom. Before I could process it, she was on her feet, forcefully pulling my jaw open.
“Jenna, let me see. Did you hide it in your cheek?”
She ruthlessly pried my mouth open, her fingers digging into the tender flesh of my chin. The pain made me flinch, but she reacted instantly with a cuff to the side of my head.
“Hold still!”
When she found nothing in my mouth, she grabbed a spoon and stretched them toward my throat, rummaging deep inside. I dry-heaved repeatedly, tears finally streaming from the violation, but the search still came up empty.
Next, she moved on to a body search. Nothing.
Mom was furious. She delivered another stinging slap to my cheek and yelled the accusation.
“Jenna Johnson, where did you put that coin!”
My voice was a choked sob. “I don’t know where the coin is.”
The air thickened, and the game of hide-and-seek reached a dead end. No one could find the coin.
Jake, my brother, ever the quick thinker, piped up with an idea.
“Mom, since the coin is missing, why don’t we just make a new batch of Croissant? Maybe you just forgot to put the coin in the first one.”
My parents’ strained faces finally softened. Dad was quick with the praise for his favorite.
“That’s my boy! Smartest one here. The future head of this family!”
“That settles it. Let’s make another batch and see who gets the coin this time!”
Mom’s relief was total. “You’re right, you’re right! I must have forgotten to put it in the dough just now!” She immediately scurried into the kitchen to mix the dough.
I knew with absolute certainty that if she made them, the coin would still end up in my bowl.
So, I followed her into the kitchen and offered to take over.
But Mom recoiled immediately, putting on a show of false concern.
“No, no, darling. I misunderstood you earlier. You rest now. Mom will have them ready in a minute.”
“Go watch TV with your father.” She tried to usher me out, but I stood my ground.
“I want to make them this time.”
We stood at an impasse.
Dad’s voice boomed from the living room, “Are those Croissant done yet? It’s taking forever to boil one single thing!”
Mom looked at me, a silent war raging in her eyes, and finally conceded.
“Fine! Fine, you can make them!”
But it was only a half-concession. She stood right beside me the whole time, her eyes glued to the dough with the coin tucked inside. She was terrified I might switch it.
But I wasn’t trying to switch it. I just wanted to see what would happen when there was no human intervention. I wanted to know if I really was the lucky child.
Soon, the coin-bearing Croissant was lost among its brethren, dropped into the oven.
A few minutes later, they were done.

Mom didn’t give me a chance to get near the oven. She shoved me out of the way, grabbed the ladle, and started furiously searching the water. She was trying to identify the coin’s location.
But submerged in the water, they all looked the same. Even with her laser-like focus on the one she watched me make, she couldn’t tell it apart.
Infuriated, she turned her anger on me.
“Look at the way you cook! It took so long to boil them. How much electricity did you waste?”
I simply let out a slow breath and didn't reply.
Finally, her eyes brightened. She must have identified one of the Croissant, because she quickly scooped it out, put it in a bowl, and visibly relaxed.
She glared at me, then rushed out and placed the bowl she’d carefully selected right in front of me.
“Jenna, eat up while they’re hot!”
The others were distributed haphazardly among the rest of the family. Only mine was chosen with meticulous care.
I curved my lips into a slight, bitter smile of sarcasm. I poked the Croissant open and put it in my mouth. A sudden, sharp CLINK echoed through the dining room.
Mom’s face lit up with triumph.
“Aha! See? I knew it! Our Jenna is still the luckiest one! Since it’s you, the Fifty Thousand Dollars is all yours, dear!”
I spit the half-chewed Croissant plate and held it out to her, looking perfectly innocent.
“But Mom, I didn’t find the coin.”
My parents’ faces drained of color. Even whiter than theirs was the absolutely frozen expression on my brother, Jake.
I turned and pointed to him. “It looks like Jake is the luckiest one this year, Mom. So, I guess I’m off the hook for the fifty grand.”
Jake immediately spit the coin into his bowl and started screaming at Mom.
“How could you have given it to me! This is fifty thousand dollars! I can’t afford that!”
Dad quickly pulled Jake into a hug, soothing him.
“Easy, easy. Of course, you won’t pay. You’re too young. You just focus on school, son. Don’t you worry about this.”
Mom immediately jumped in. “That’s right! Fifty thousand is too much for you. You don’t have to pay!”
I had been prepared to feel a flicker of relief, but their words shocked the air out of my lungs. I started trembling with rage, no longer able to suppress the scream building inside.
“Why does he get a pass? When I was thirteen and found the coin, you made me pay three thousand dollars! I still had to do it!”
“Why is he suddenly exempt?”
Jake pouted and started rubbing his eyes, faking tears, but the look he flashed me was pure, malicious triumph.
Mom’s eyes went cold, and her voice was laced with resentment.
“Your brother is still a child. He can’t handle fifty grand. If someone has to pay, I’ll cover two hundred dollars for him.”
Cover it for him?
When I was thirteen, she had never uttered those words. Back then, her face was ice-cold. “We will not pay it for you. You will gather that money, even if you have to scavenge for cans, or we will disown you.”
But now, she was offering to cover him, and only for two hundred dollars.
Tears fell like rain. It took me several choked attempts before I could speak through my sobs.
“No! He has to pay the fifty thousand! If he doesn’t have it, he has to earn it, just like I did! He can scavenge for money!”
Mom bit down on her cheek and viciously grabbed my arm, twisting it hard.
“Why are you being so stubborn, you worthless girl! That was years ago! Your brother can’t scavenge for money! What would people say about us?”

“And stop harping on the past! I’m the founder of the Family Trust Fund, and I have the right to decide that your brother only has to contribute two hundred dollars!”
My legs felt weak, and I stumbled a few steps before grasping the edge of the dining table to steady myself.
“No! You said the rules couldn’t be easily changed!”
Mom ignored me completely, turning to comfort my crying brother. I stood there, an outsider, a complete anomaly in my own family.
As Dad left the room, his gaze on me was sharp and threatening.
“Be the adult, Jenna. Your brother is ten years younger than you. Don’t pick fights with him over petty things. Be generous, understand?”
I bit my lip so hard I tasted blood before I finally came back to myself.
I sat back down at the table and thought for a long time. I knew I had to compromise, at least on the surface.
So, I went to find Mom to discuss withdrawing money from the Family Trust.
The original rules stated that the coin-finder could not access the fund, but those who didn't find it could. Now that I was in the clear, I could finally lessen the pressure on myself. I hadn’t even been able to pay my rent after clearing my last debt.
I collected myself and went to Mom.
“Mom, could you transfer about two thousand dollars from the Family Trust? I need to…”
I was interrupted before I could finish my sentence by her shrill voice.
“I don’t have any money! How old are you, demanding money from your family! Are you trying to leech off us?”
“I was independent at your age! You need to learn from me! Don’t just open your mouth and ask for cash! Two thousand dollars? Do you think money grows on trees?”
I pushed back. “But the rule was that whoever didn’t find the coin could use the fund! Why can’t I use it?”
After all, ninety-nine percent of that money was contributed by me, and yet I was the one who was forbidden to use it. The irony was devastating.
Mom avoided my gaze, reverting to her favorite tactic: cold silence. She just went back to playing with Jake, ignoring me completely. Dad, smoking by the window, acted like the conversation had nothing to do with him.
The silence was driving me crazy. I couldn’t help but raise my voice.
“Why can’t I use it!”
Mom stayed quiet for a long moment, then spoke with a forced, placating tone. “It’s not that I won’t let you, dear. It’s just that I put all that money into a Certificate of Deposit, a locked-in account. I can’t withdraw it right now.”
“Is that true?” I asked weakly.
My mother snapped instantly, as if I had hit a nerve.
“Are you questioning me?! Do you think I’m lying? What could I possibly gain by deceiving you!”
“You walk around with a frown all the time, acting like I owe you millions! Get out! You’re not welcome here!”
Every word felt like a surgical blade, carving the pain deep into my heart.
When I didn’t move, she stood up and started physically pushing me out the door.
Our relationship froze over that day.
A week later, Mom called, actively trying to mend the relationship and inviting me over for dinner.
When I arrived, four bowls of Croissant were arranged neatly on the table. The other three were already claimed.
Mom approached me affectionately, pulling me towards the table.
“Jenna, the Family Trust Fund is a little low. So, we took a vote and unanimously decided to try the Croissant one more time to find our biggest contributor! A chance to help the family!”
“Hurry, Jenna, eat! They’re fresh out of the oven and still hot.”
The eyes of all three of them were fixed on me, calculating. This bowl was clearly meant to seal my fate.
When I hesitated, Mom urged me on.
“Go on! They’ll get cold!”
Filled with a fresh wave of disappointment, I sat down and started eating the Croissant, big bites, practically swallowing them whole. Seeing this, the other three relaxed and began eating their own.
But the next moment, Mom froze mid-chew.
