Five years. Two thousand days and nights. I perfected the role of "Jax's favorite toy."

By day, an indispensable assistant. By night, an obedient one.

I never once asked for a title, never craved his affection. Even in bed, I meticulously copied her every move, her every whisper.

Everyone said I was hopelessly in love with Jax.

Until the night I learned Chloe had returned.


Scarlett POV

The lighter flared, its blue flame spitting and dancing in the dim room.

Jax King leaned against the headboard, shirtless, his sharp features already hazing behind the fresh cigarette smoke.

I didn't look at him, just bent to pick up the clothes scattered across the floor.

My knee scraped against the silk sheets, sending a sharp sting through my nerves.

"Chloe arrives tomorrow."

His voice was hoarse, like he was announcing an arrangement that needed no discussion.

My fingers paused on a button, just for a second, then quickly, deftly fastened it.

"I know. My resignation letter is in your email. I'll complete the handover with Miss Chloe tomorrow."

Jax King scoffed, the cigarette still between his lips.

The next second, he reached out, clamping my chin, wrenching my face to his.

"Scarlett, this professional act of yours, it's sickening."

His fingers tightened, pressing painfully into my jaw.

I didn't utter a sound, just lowered my eyes, gazing at the angry red marks still scarring his torso.

I'd left them there, moments ago, in a moment of lost control.

"Good," I said, my voice flat. "Because you won't ever have to see it again."

He stared at me, his gaze dark and heavy, saying nothing.

Soon, he released me, grabbing a check from the nightstand. He held it between two fingers, then casually tossed it onto my lap.

"Five million. With the five million from our contract five years ago, that's ten million total. Settled."

I picked up the check, glancing at the numbers.

Just enough. Barely enough for Leo's heart transplant next week.

"Thank you."

I folded the check, slipped it into my bag, and started to get up.

But a hand suddenly seized my wrist.

The world tilted, and I was back on the bed before I could blink.

His body was a hot, inescapable weight.

"Taking the money and fleeing?" His breath was hot against my ear, his voice chillingly soft.

"We're not done."

I pushed against his shoulder.

"Jax, Chloe's back tomorrow."

"So what?"

He bit hard, right on the fresh hickey blooming on my collarbone. The force was brutal.

"Until she walks through that door, you're mine. And I'll have you whenever I damn well please."

I gasped, a sharp intake of breath from the pain.

"No marks. She'll notice."

That did the trick.

His movements stopped instantly.

He propped himself up, looking down at me, his gaze cold and hard.

A moment later, he rolled off the bed and walked straight into the bathroom.

The sound of running water quickly filled the room.

I lay on the tangled sheets, staring at the chandelier on the ceiling.

Didn't care?

How could I not?

Five years ago, desperate for Leo's surgery money, I signed that contract.

I told myself it was just a deal.

But the truth? I was already gone, lost to him the moment I first saw him, back in the campus library.

For five years, I loved him.

I wore white like Chloe. Drenched myself in her perfume. In the bed, I even mimicked her whispers, her sighs.

Now the original was back.

And I, the substitute, it was time to dissolve.

I sat up on the bed, my legs still shaky.

I straightened my clothes, checking that the five-million-dollar check was tucked securely against my body.

That was the most important thing now.

Outside the door, the electronic lock chimed.

"Jax! I changed my flight! I'm back early!"

The voice was clear, light, bubbling with undisguised joy.

My fingers, mid-button, froze.

The water in the bathroom stopped.

The bedroom door swung open.

Chloe, draped in a custom-made designer dress, fluttered in like a delicate butterfly.

Our eyes met.

The air seemed to drain from the room.

Her smile faltered.

Her gaze, sharp and calculating, raked over my disheveled hair, my slightly swollen lips, and the faint, undeniable bite marks I hadn't quite managed to hide.

"Scarlett?"

Her voice turned sharp.

"What are you doing in Jax's room, so late?"

Before I could speak, the bathroom door opened.

Jax walked out, wrapped only in a towel, his hair still dripping.

Seeing Chloe, he clearly paused.

"Chloe, why are you back so early?"

He strode towards her, passing me without a single glance.

"Jax..."

Chloe's eyes welled up instantly.

"Why is she here? What are you-"

He pulled her close, murmuring soft comforts against her hair.

Then he looked at me, his tone chillingly calm.

"Scarlett was just here with some urgent documents," he said smoothly. "I accidentally spilled coffee on her, so she came in to change."

Chloe sniffled, clearly unconvinced.

"Documents that needed to be delivered... right onto your bed?"

"The documents are over there."

He gestured to a file on the nightstand.

It was an employment termination agreement.

Dated today. His way of saying goodbye.

Chloe saw it and laughed, tears still clinging to her lashes.

She looked at me, a triumphant smirk playing on her lips.

"So you're leaving.

I almost thought you were trying to seduce your boss, no boundaries at all."

I squeezed the strap of my bag, my fingertips aching.

My gaze, against my will, drifted to Jax.

He was bent over, gently wiping away Chloe's tears, a tenderness so alien to me, it was almost laughable.

"Well, the misunderstanding is cleared up,"

He looked at me.

"Scarlett, aren't you going?"

"Right."

I nodded.

"Enjoy your reunion."

As I turned to leave, I heard her playful voice behind me.

"This sheet is dirty, Jax. I can't possibly sleep on it."

"I'll have new ones brought up immediately."

"And I don't like the smell in here."

"I'll have everything dealt with tomorrow."

I closed the door, shutting out their voices.

In the elevator mirror, my reflection was ghost-pale.

The final five million. At last.

Seven days.

After Leo's surgery, I would vanish.

Goodbye, Jax.
