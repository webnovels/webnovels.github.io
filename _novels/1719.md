The night before my wedding, I found out my mafia boss fiancé had a child outside of our relationship.
He was sorting through the invitations, his voice calm, almost detached:
"It was a mistake from my youth. 
The child is born, I have to take responsibility. 
She had nowhere else to go, so she's staying at the estate with Leo."
My entire body stiffened, a cold dread seizing me.
It took me a long time to find my voice: "So, these three years we've been together… what was all that?"
"I wronged you. Whether we get married or not, that's your call."
My hand instinctively pressed against my lower abdomen.
There, a secret was hidden, one I had planned to tell him today.

My chest ached with a dull, suffocating pain.
"So, for three years, every holiday when you said you had urgent business to handle—"
"I was seeing them." He cut in, his tone flat. "Anya is good with the boy, and Leo is well-behaved."
Three years. He could have told me sooner, but he kept it a secret.
A subtle cramp twisted in my lower abdomen.
I instinctively covered the spot.
Dante's eyes dropped to my hand, and his brow furrowed.
"You look unwell." He stepped forward, reaching for my forehead.
I recoiled abruptly, my spine hitting the cold tile wall.
"Don't touch me."
Just then, his phone rang.
From the other end came a woman's muffled sobs, laced with a faint accent:
"Dante, Leo has a fever. Can you please come see him?"
Dante rubbed his temples. "Alright, I'll send a doctor over."
Hanging up, he looked at me: "The boy's quite fragile."
I laughed, tears streaming down my face: "Take me to them."
He was silent for a long moment.
His phone vibrated again. This time, it was my dad, Richard.
"Chloe, I've sent out all the wedding invitations! Everyone's saying Dante is powerful, and that you have good taste!"
I choked back my sobs: "Dad, I'm busy. I have to hang up!"
After I hung up, Dante said:
"The invitations are out, the hotel's booked. I've given you the grand wedding you wanted."
I looked up at him: "Are you trying to threaten me with this?"
"I said, you can choose whether or not to go through with it! You just need to think clearly."
I choked on my words, then let out a mocking, hollow laugh.
"Get out."
Dante paused. "Chloe…"
"I said, GET OUT!"
I grabbed a glass nearby and hurled it at him!
He didn't dodge.
"You're too emotional right now. I'll come back when you've calmed down."
The door softly clicked shut.
I slid down the wall, collapsing to the floor.
My phone vibrated. It was Uncle Mike.
I took a deep breath before answering: "Uncle Mike?"
Uncle Mike sighed: "Chloe, your dad has late-stage cancer. He doesn't have much time left. He kept it from you, hoping to see you get married, to build a family."
My phone slipped from my grasp, falling to the floor as silent tears ran down my face.
After a long time contemplating, I called Dante.
"Tomorrow's wedding? It's on as scheduled!"
