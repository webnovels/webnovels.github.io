The tenth time I attempted to have the wedding, my boyfriend was, for the tenth time, called away by a phone call from his so-called childhood sweetheart.

I was left alone on the stage, becoming a complete laughing stock.

I swallowed my pride and contacted my boyfriend, begging him to return and at least go through the motions. But he wouldn’t even pick up my calls!

His childhood sweetheart smugly sent me a photo of them lying in bed together, flaunting, "I won!"

My heart turned completely cold.

The wedding had been scheduled ten times, yet postponed ten times.

The master of ceremonies looked at me with sympathy, "Do you still want to continue with the wedding?"

I smiled, "Yes! It must be completed!"

I sent a message to the boy-next-door, and upon receiving his affirmative reply, I breathed a sigh of relief and informed the master of ceremonies to wait a little longer.

This was already my tenth wedding attempt, and I couldn’t let it be ruined again.
