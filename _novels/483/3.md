Liam didn't return all night. I lay awake until dawn.

As soon as I walked out of the bedroom, I saw Tommy who had come to visit me.

He was holding a bag of my favorite chestnut pastries, standing downstairs with a bright smile.

"Sis! Come down quick! I got up at 5am and waited in line for over two hours to buy these! They're still warm!"

My nose stung with emotion as I rushed downstairs to hug him.

"Aww, such touching sibling love—"

Chloe suddenly pushed open the door and walked in.

With a smug look, she said: "I'm here to get some clean clothes for Liam. He spent the whole night with me yesterday, he's exhausted."

"I don't know what got into Liam last night. I told him to be gentle since there's a baby in my belly, but he kissed me so passionately he almost lost control."

She was actually pregnant with Liam's child...

"Liam said he hates children. He won't let you keep it."

After I said this, Chloe burst out laughing.

"Aria, is something wrong with your brain?"

"I'm over two months pregnant already. Liam takes me for prenatal checkups every week, and even had special nutritional supplements brought in from abroad for me."

"You actually think he would make me get an abortion? What a joke!"

"The reason Liam said that to you is because he finds you disgusting. He doesn't want a half-breed wolf child!"

I was struck speechless, my heart aching uncontrollably.

Nine abortions in three years. It turns out he didn't hate children, he just hated the one carrying the child - me...

"How dare you bully my sister, I'll bite you to death!"

Tommy suddenly transformed into wolf form and lunged at Chloe.

Although I held him back, Chloe was still scared enough to fall on her butt.

In the end, she scrambled to her feet and ran away.

But before leaving, she threw back one last vicious remark: "Aria, you dare make me look bad! I'll make you regret this!"

I thought she would go tell on me to Liam, making him come torture me.

But when Liam returned that night, he acted as usual, even showing rare concern for me and Tommy.

"Aria, isn't your brother starting elementary school next year?"

"He's always been mischievous, with mediocre grades. I hate seeing you worry about him all the time, so I found a tutor who can help him study well over the summer break."

This was the first time he had shown concern for me since Chloe's return.

I immediately felt a warmth in my heart.

I was so moved I choked up: "Liam, thank you for thinking of me and Tommy."

Seeing how touched I was, Liam's expression tightened slightly.
