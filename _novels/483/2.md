"Have you lost your mind?!"

The clan chief looked at me, brought back by clan members, his expression extremely grim.

"After extracting your spirit root, you'll become a normal human, not only exiled from the wolf clan, but also lose half your lifespan!"

"How is that any different from seeking death?!"

"But living like this is a thousand times more painful than death."

The chief's expression softened as he looked at my weak state, but he still tried to persuade me: "Wolf clan descendants are already rare, and you're from the strongest lineage. Even if you must extract your spirit root, at least leave behind offspring with Liam first."

Hearing this, I laughed bitterly.

"Liam said he doesn't like children. I've been pregnant several times over the past two years, but he always sent people to take me to the hospital for abortions."

"I'm really tired..."

At this moment, my little wolf brother Tommy suddenly darted out and stood protectively in front of me.

He bared his newly sprouted fangs at the chief who was pressuring me, and snarled: "No one can bully my sister! Watch out old man, or I'll bite you!"

Seeing this, the chief shook his head helplessly and finally relented.

But my body was too weak now, and I needed to recover for five days before the spirit root extraction ritual could be performed.

However, the very next day, Liam called.

He demanded to know why I hadn't returned all night, and ordered me to come back immediately.

I couldn't control my love for him, and agreed without any dignity.

But Liam, in four days, this love will disappear...

Clan members sent me back to the villa.

When the door opened, I saw Liam sitting on the couch smoking a cigar.

Tommy was about to rush over and bite him to avenge me.

Liam didn't panic at all, and coldly called out: "Aria—"

He knew I wouldn't let him come to any harm.

As he expected, I quickly stepped forward and grabbed Tommy.

"Sis, after how he's treated you, you're still protecting him!"

Seeing the indignation on Tommy's face, my heart ached terribly.

I could only have the clan members forcibly take him away.

After everyone left, Liam got up carelessly and handed me a diamond necklace.

"I didn't know you had just had an abortion that day. This is a gift to make up for it."

It was his secretary who had taken me to the hospital, yet now he claimed he didn't know...

I looked up at him, tears involuntarily welling up in my eyes.

Seeing my weak and pitiful state, his face immediately tightened and he grew aroused.

Perhaps to him, my only remaining value was for this.

Then he gripped my waist, lifted me onto the table, and eagerly leaned down to kiss me.

However, just as our lips were about to meet, his phone rang.

Chloe's coquettish voice came from the other end.

"Liam, I'm not feeling well. Can you come see me?"

Hearing this, Liam withdrew his hand from my waist and replied anxiously: "Alright, I'll be right there."

"Liam—"

I called out to stop him.

"Why are you... so good to her..."

Faced with my questioning, Liam replied in a deep voice: "Fifteen years ago when my adoptive parents abandoned me on the street, it was Chloe who gave me bread and saved me. She stayed with me through that most difficult time. If it wasn't for her, I would have frozen to death in the snow."

Boy, bread, snow...

Suddenly, some fragmented images flashed through my mind, but stopped abruptly after a sharp pain.

But at this moment, I no longer had the energy to dwell on those long-lost memories.

I looked at Liam, my voice trembling uncontrollably: "But I've saved you too—"

"More than once."

Hearing this, his tone turned cold: "You saved me only because I'm your imprinted lover. That's what you're supposed to do for me."

With that, he shook off my hand and hurriedly left the villa.

Watching Liam's resolute back as he walked away, I recalled how excited he had been when he first learned he was my imprinted lover, hugging me with eyes full of deep affection.

I naively thought he actually liked me.

Until Chloe came back, and he started torturing me in various ways to make her happy, even making me transform into a wolf multiple times to kneel under Chloe as her mount.

That's when I realized his initial joy was never because he liked me.

It was because he discovered he had gained someone who could be mistreated without care, yet would still love him steadfastly...

But Liam, I don't want to love you anymore.

I struggled to crawl over to my clothes, picked up my phone, and dialed a number.

"Chief, I want to extract my spirit root and erase Liam's wolf clan imprint."
