Not long after they left, I dialed Leo’s number with trembling hands.

I wanted to ask him what was going on.

Since he already knew the truth, why hadn’t he said a single word to me? Did he also think this was some kind of “test” for me?

The phone rang for a long time before it was finally answered.

“Hello? What do you want? I’m busy!”

Leo’s voice was utterly impatient. In the background, I clearly heard Victor’s voice: “Leo, do you like this Patek Philippe watch? It perfectly suits our Leo’s status.”

Seraphina’s gentle voice echoed, “Yes, Leo, wear this, and you’ll be the handsomest young man around.”

So, after leaving the hospital, they had gone straight to a luxury store with Leo.

Leo must have been at the hospital earlier too, or rather, he’d come with Seraphina and Victor all along.

He just couldn’t be bothered to even step into the ward to take a look.

On the phone, Leo responded to their every word, his tone filled with genuine intimacy, as if they were the real family.

Yes, they were the real family.

I was just an “outsider” who had raised their son for free for eighteen years.

But I still couldn't give up, and I spoke: “Leo, your Aunt Skylar… she got into a car accident. She’s still unconscious in the hospital. Can you come see her?”

“Oh, okay.” Leo’s voice was flat, devoid of emotion, even carrying an undertone of annoyance at being disturbed.

He didn’t care at all about the aunt who had doted on him since he was little, who would have plucked the stars from the sky for him if he’d asked, who loved him the most.

“If there’s nothing else, I’m hanging up. I still have things to pick out!”

Before I could say anything else, Leo abruptly hung up.

The buzzing dial tone finally severed the bond between us, father and son.

For eighteen years, our entire family, the Alex family, had cherished him, Leo, like the apple of our eye, sacrificing so much, giving so much for him.

My mom’s presbyopia, my dad’s back injury, my sister’s severe injuries now…

Who knew that all our efforts, our everything, would only nurture a cold-hearted, ungrateful viper!

Since Leo didn’t value this family anymore, there was no point in us demeaning ourselves any further for an outsider.

A week later, Skylar’s condition stabilized, and she was discharged from the hospital.

The four of us, with no regrets, quietly left the city that held too much pain, returning to our quiet little hometown we’d left behind long ago.

We had originally moved to the big city just for Leo’s schooling.

Now… there was no need anymore!

I never thought Seraphina would still be sending me messages at a time like this.

She was publicly and lavishly throwing a grand birthday gala for Leo.

The dozens of messages she sent me were still in her usual imperious, princess-like tone.

She ordered me to bring the whole family to Leo’s birthday gala on time, even saying she had arranged a suit for me and that I should dress appropriately, so as not to embarrass the Seraphina family.

I looked at those condescending words and found them utterly ridiculous. I casually turned off my phone and tossed it aside.

At the birthday gala, Seraphina waited for a long time, but I never showed up.

She clearly couldn't bear to lose face in front of the numerous dignitaries and celebrities.

“Go, bring Alex to me!”

Annoyed, she sent her assistant to the apartment I rented.

Another hour passed, but the assistant returned alone, looking flustered.
