Married for five years, Asher passed me off to his boss, Finn.

The first time, he said, "Adeline, just have a meal with him, and he'll hand me the project."

The second time, "Adeline, just spend the night with him. He promised he wouldn't harm you!"

The third time, "Adeline, why not have a child with him? Then he'll promote me to General Manager!"

Later, on the day Asher joyfully became the General Manager, I divorced him and instead married Finn.

After I posted our marriage certificate on Facebook, Asher was filled with regret.
