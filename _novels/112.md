My son is an adrenaline junkie when it comes to travel. He proposed a trip to the vibrant, enigmatic Crimson Lake. The water there is extremely acidic, exuding a lethal presence. I was uneasy about it, so I accompanied him.

But shockingly, my son pushed me into the lake.

The water slowly ate away at my body, and I met a tragic end far from home. When I opened my eyes again, it was the day my son had suggested the trip. "Go ahead, my son, don't worry. Mom's got your back."
