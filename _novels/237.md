After my dad passed, I decided to divorce my husband, the Major, and stay in this little mountain town for good.

Day one, I tricked Mark into signing the divorce papers.

Day five, I handed in my resignation at the old job.

Day seven, I cooked a big farewell dinner for all my friends.

Mark frowned, asking why I'd made dishes Sarah didn't even like.

I stood up and toasted his childhood sweetheart.

From that day forward, Mark was no longer my concern.
