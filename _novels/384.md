The day I found out I was pregnant, Ryan was tenderly cradling Chloe, who was supposedly blind. Then, he turned and *slammed* my pregnancy test report right into my face.

"You abandoned me without a second thought when I crashed my car. If Chloe hadn't given me her cornea, I probably would have died, left for dead in the middle of nowhere."

"Now you've gone to all this trouble to get pregnant with my child. You just want to use the baby to climb your way back into my life and resume your role as the lady of this mansion, don't you? Let me tell you, forget it. Only Chloe deserves to be the wife of the CEO of *my* family!"

Tears streamed down my face as Ryan's hand clamped tightly around my neck, his voice a low growl.

"I'll give you a chance to make things right. All you have to do is seduce my older brother—the one who's already married—and force him to marry you. Grandpa will definitely kick him out of the family business then, and I'll be the sole heir."

But later, when the truth was finally revealed, and I became his sister-in-law, just as he'd wished...

He knelt on the ground, begging for my forgiveness.

I simply smiled, and took back the cornea I had once given him.
