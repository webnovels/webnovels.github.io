After Beatrix returned, she challenged me, suggesting we see who could make Asher break his vows nine times first.

I smirked and wrote down the terms of the bet on the spot: "If you win, I'll bow out. But if you lose, I'll make it impossible for you to stay in Beijing City."

But only I knew how uncertain I truly felt.

In our three years of marriage, Asher would do anything I asked, except break his vows. Within a week, he started coming home less frequently.

Determined, I put on the new lingerie I bought and walked into his quiet room. I took his hand and guided it down my body...

I could feel his breath becoming heavier, his eyes filled with a new desire. But then his phone rang, and he snapped out of it, pushing me away and storming out.

He didn't return for three hours. I stood there, feeling the warmth drain from my body, unable to think.

Until Beatrix appeared, flaunting a used strawberry-flavored item, showing me the sticky substance inside.

"Adeline, this marks the ninth time."

"I told you, Asher loves me. Why don't you believe it?"

"A bet is a bet."

Looking at her smug expression, I thought of how I had just humiliated myself, begging Asher for attention. A wave of dizziness hit me.

Why was I degrading myself like this?

Before I married, I was the prized daughter of the Beijing Circle. Why was I now reduced to competing with Beatrix for a place in bed?

Feigning indifference, I took out the signed divorce papers from the bedside drawer.

"Take it and leave."

Beatrix raised an eyebrow in surprise.

"You confronted Asher?"

I shrugged nonchalantly.

"No, Asher said I could decide about the divorce on my own."

"He's just a man. If you want him, he's yours."

But seeing Asher's name on the papers...

My heart felt pierced.

This was Asher's wedding gift to me.

Asher always kept his promises.

He stopped my hands from undoing his buttons, saying he had to keep his vows for three years and asked me to wait for him.

But if I ever grew tired...

I could sign my name on the divorce papers anytime, and he would accept my decision.

At that time, I was overjoyed, thinking I had him for life.

Now I realized how foolish I was.

Was he setting me free or just making it easy for him to escape anytime?

Beatrix reviewed the papers twice, showing a satisfied smile.

"Miss Adeline, as decisive as ever."

"Everyone in Beijing City knows you spent five years pursuing Asher. I thought you'd cry."

"How about this, in a week, when Asher fully leaves his vows behind, I'll give him these papers as a gift."

"You both won't have to torment each other anymore."

I coldly showed her out.

But I had to admit Beatrix was right.

Keeping someone who doesn't love me by my side for five years, if not torture, then what is it?

I opened my phone and found the tickets to Iceland for Asher and me next week.

Asher doesn't like traveling abroad, but I insisted.

Was he thinking how troublesome I was, always asking for so much, when he agreed?

I used my finger to cancel Asher's ticket.

If that's the case, I'll let him go.

This mistake shouldn’t continue.
