I ordered Asher’s belongings to be packed and sent back to his own home.

Asher entered with breakfast, brushing past the movers.

Seeing his incense burner, Buddhist Scriptures, and meditation mat being carried out, he was bewildered.

"What’s going on?"

"Adeline, are you moving?"

I gave him a big smile.

"Yes, I’ve lived here too long, it's annoying now."

Then I glanced at the tray in his hand.

A dish of pickles, a bowl of white porridge, and a few slices of bread.

Not even an egg.

Asher doesn’t eat meat, so I’ve also eaten vegetarian for years.

So I grabbed my bag and headed out.

"You keep it for yourself."

Ignoring his surprised look completely.

I no longer cared what Asher thought.

That night, I gathered with some Beijing Circle sisters at a bar for drinks, also planning to say goodbye.

My friends teased me non-stop.

"Miss Adeline out drinking, aren’t you afraid your precious, fastidious husband will be mad?"

"Yeah, the little princess has been so virtuous since marriage, what changed today?"

I sneered.

"Being virtuous should be for someone worthy."

Just then, a commotion erupted in a corner of the bar.

Two people were having a drinking contest.

Whoever downed twelve cocktails first could take a woman home that night.

I ignored his look of surprise entirely.

I don't care what Asher thinks now.

That evening, I gathered a few friends from the Beijing social circle for a farewell at a bar.

My friends teased me relentlessly.

“Miss Adeline is out drinking. Aren’t you worried that your fussy, neat-freak husband will get upset?”

“Yeah, the darling of the Beijing Circle has been the perfect wife since getting married. What's changed today?”

I let out a cold laugh.

“Being faithful should be reserved for someone who deserves it.”

At that moment, a commotion erupted in the corner of the bar.

People were saying that two individuals were about to have a drinking contest. Whoever finishes twelve cocktails first gets to take a woman home tonight.

My friends went to check it out, but they returned looking troubled.

“Adeline, you should go see. It’s your husband, Asher.”

I didn't react.

I knew I should be surprised—that a husband who never drinks would go to such lengths for another woman.

But inside, I felt nothing.

It was as if my love for Asher had died yesterday.

I even led everyone over with a sense of amusement.

“Let’s go watch the spectacle.”

Asher stood at the long table lined with drinks, visibly shocked to see me.

But as soon as he took a step, the bartender reminded him.

“Sir, leaving now means forfeiting. Are you sure you want to give up?”

He glanced at me, then at Beatrix, hesitated, and turned away.

“No forfeiting.”

Beatrix leaned in, speaking maliciously under the cover of the loud bar music.

“Adeline, maybe you should try to talk to Asher?”

“After all, you won’t be husband and wife much longer. You can still ask him a few more times.”

“But then again, if Asher doesn’t listen to you even once, that’s pretty sad, isn’t it?”

I ignored Beatrix and just stared at Asher’s face.

His eyes never met mine, intentionally avoiding me.

He kept fiddling with his Prayer Beads.

I know him; it’s a sign he’s nervous and guilty.

The onlookers were moved by his and Beatrix’s supposed love.

“Drinking all twelve would definitely land you in the hospital. This guy must really love his girlfriend.”

“True love indeed, wish them eternal happiness.”

The veins on Asher’s forehead pulsed.

He shouted, “Shut up.”

Then, turning to me, he whispered, “Adeline, I have my reasons. I’ll explain everything when we get home.”

I smiled.

I gently reminded him.

“Asher, you promised to keep your vows for three years. Just three more days.”

“If you drink this, our agreement means nothing.”

His expression froze. He was silent for a long time before nodding.

“Then it means nothing. Let’s go home tonight. I’ll make it up to you.”

I knew he meant consummating our marriage.

But now, I just wanted to laugh.

He finally chose to break his vow for me, after having done everything he shouldn’t for another woman.

I took off my wedding ring.

Dropped it into his drink, then turned to leave.

But with so many people around, I accidentally knocked over a champagne tower.

Countless glasses crashed down.

I heard Asher shouting my name.

But in the crucial moment, he protected Beatrix instead.

Glasses shattered on the ground, and as my vision faded to black, I saw Asher running toward me.

I knew he picked me up, his hands trembling.

He whispered in my ear over and over that he loved me.

But the words made me sick.

When I woke, it was three days later.

My friends said that after I was rushed to the emergency room, Asher stayed outside the whole time, refusing to bandage his own bleeding injuries.

They said Asher stayed by my bedside these past few days, doing everything himself, not letting anyone else even wipe my face.

They also said Asher prepared a huge banquet hall filled with my favorite cornflowers, though they didn't know what for.

I called the butler: “Take me to the airport.”

As the car left the hospital, I saw Asher’s car arriving.

When our cars passed, I rolled up the window.

Asher was genuinely happy.

He had owed Beatrix twelve wishes, and the drinking contest was the last one.

Asher thought he could finally let Beatrix go and wholeheartedly love his wife.

But when he entered the hospital room.

The bed was empty.

Every inch of the sheets was perfectly smooth, with no sign of wrinkles.

In that moment, his face showed confusion, doubt, and finally, indescribable panic.

Beatrix handed him a document with a bright smile.

“Asher, you’re finally free!”

“This is the divorce agreement Adeline signed. We can finally be together again!”
