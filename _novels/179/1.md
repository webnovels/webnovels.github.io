"Hurry up and wash these clothes; I need them for a meeting tomorrow," Jasper said, tossing his clothes at me before heading into the bathroom.

I held his shirt, my expression less than pleased.

Jasper loved cleanliness; his clothes weren't dirty and even smelled nice.

But why did they have the scent of another woman's perfume?

"Hazel, why isn't the floor mopped properly? The towel's still wet," Jasper shouted from the bathroom.

"You're home all day, and this is all you manage to do?" he added.

When we first bought this house, I wanted to hire a housekeeper.

During the early days of starting my business, I lived in the basement to save money, which left me with chronic back pain.

When my mother-in-law found out, she mocked, "You think you're some wealthy lady who needs a nanny?"

"Back pain is just an excuse for being lazy. Work more, and it'll get better."

"The house isn't big; you can clean it yourself without wasting money on help."

I glanced at Jasper, but he was engrossed in his phone, not noticing me at all.

Later, I found out that his first love announced her relationship on social media that day.
