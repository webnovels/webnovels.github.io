Adeline threw the lunchbox into the trash right in front of me.

She avoided Jasper's hand, smiling: "Never mind, the 'boss lady' is here, how could I dare to have lunch with the boss alone?"

She winked at Jasper and walked out of the office in her high heels.

As she passed by, her gaze swept over me carelessly as if I were just a roadside rat.

She seemed to inadvertently lift her hair, revealing a neck dotted with red marks—clearly kiss marks.

It wasn't until Adeline's figure disappeared around the corner that Jasper withdrew his gaze, never looking at me once.

"Aren't you going to explain? Why is she here?" I asked, trembling.

Jasper finally gave me a glance: "Her company had some issues, so she's working as my assistant now."

"Aren't you thrilled? Finally able to be with her day and night." I couldn't help but jab at him.

"If you hadn't come, I could've had lunch with her today and spent more time together." He looked at me with a mocking expression.

Silence flowed between us like a current, leaving us speechless for a long time.

After a while, I suddenly chuckled, though my heart was full of bitterness.
