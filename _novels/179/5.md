I turned and sat on the sofa, gritting my teeth: "So what, I'm not just coming today, I'll come every day. I want to see how bold she is to stay with a married man."

"I'm the one on your marriage certificate, the company's 'boss lady'," I emphasized.

Jasper sneered: "'Boss lady'? Only you care about these empty titles."

I caught my breath, feeling like something was blocking my heart.

The air fell silent again.

In a fit of pique, I stayed in the office, not wanting Adeline to come looking for Jasper again.

Unknowingly, I actually fell asleep on the sofa.

I was woken up by pain, my stomach felt like a blade was stirring it, twisting my insides into a bloody mess.

Moaning in pain, Jasper finally noticed my movement: "What trick are you pulling again..."

But seeing my pale face, he suddenly fell silent.

"Stomachache again?" he asked softly, then picked me up and headed downstairs.
