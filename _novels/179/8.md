Adeline walked over, looking apologetic: "Sorry Hazel, I twisted my ankle and didn't know who else to turn to, so I called Jasper."

"I didn't know he'd leave you on the road like that. I've already scolded him." Adeline seemed angry, glaring at Jasper.

Watching their interaction, I felt colder than when walking alone.

Their mutual understanding and intimacy made them seem more like a couple than Jasper and I did.

"Adeline knew you were in this hospital, so she came to see you," Jasper said, seeing I was silent, with a slight annoyance.

Then, he handed me a menu: "Mom's birthday is in three days, make a few dishes and get a cake."

"I didn't know he would leave you alone on the street. I've already given him a piece of my mind." Adeline glared at Jasper, clearly annoyed.

Watching them interact made me feel even more isolated than when I was walking alone earlier. Their understanding and closeness made them seem more like a couple than Jasper and I ever did.

"Adeline heard you were at this hospital and came specifically to see you." Jasper looked at me with some displeasure when I didn't respond. Then, he handed me a recipe. "Mom's birthday is in three days. Go home, cook some dishes, and get a cake."

Adeline glanced at the recipe and exclaimed, "Wow, that's a lot of dishes. I can't make any of them. Hazel, you're amazing."

Jasper joked, "If you want to learn, have Hazel teach you. She's always in the kitchen, so she's most familiar with these."

Adeline laughed and shook her head. "No way, I'm a modern independent woman. I'm not going to spend my days cooking and cleaning for others."

Her words pierced my heart like a thorn. I once had dreams of pursuing a career, but now I'm just someone who's always in the kitchen.
