The silent atmosphere in the car was interrupted by a phone call.

Jasper pulled over and tersely told me: "Get out."

"What?" I was stunned.

"Adeline twisted her ankle and is in pain," Jasper explained.

"What about me? What should I do?" I panicked.

"It's less than a kilometer to the hospital. It won't take long to walk," His face showed growing impatience, "When did you become so delicate?"

The kilometer took me nearly an hour to walk.

Lying alone in the hospital bed, I watched the patient next to me, who had just had surgery, being cared for by her attentive husband.

He adjusted her blanket and made her comfortable.

When she couldn't eat after surgery, her husband patiently coaxed her with a bowl.

I buried myself under the blanket, trying to use sleep to divert my attention.

The hospital room door opened, and I looked up.

Jasper had come.

I thought he couldn't let go of me, a smile forming on my lips.

But when I saw who was behind him, my smile froze.
