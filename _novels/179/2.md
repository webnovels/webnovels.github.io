The next day, I got up early to prepare lunch for Jasper.

He's a real workaholic, often forgetting to eat when he's busy.

So, I decided to bring him lunch every day.

That day, he actually finished it all and asked me to continue bringing it to the office.

Sometimes, he would even tell me in advance what he wanted to eat.

This made cooking more fulfilling for me.

When I delivered the meal to the office, I ran into Daphne in the elevator.

Seeing the lunchbox in my hand, she smiled and said, "Hey Hazel, bringing lunch for Mr. Lu again?"

Daphne was a younger schoolmate from high school who joined Jasper's company after graduation.

On the 12th floor, she winked at me.

I walked to the office door and saw through the glass a woman inside.

She leaned close to Jasper, as if about to kiss him.
