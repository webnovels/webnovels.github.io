My mind went blank, and my body moved faster than my thoughts, rushing forward to pull the woman away.

She was wearing high heels and stumbled when I tugged her, nearly falling.

"Adeline!" Jasper rushed out from behind his desk and held her in his arms.

Seeing Adeline in Jasper's embrace was like being struck by lightning.

Adeline, Jasper's cherished first love who had gone abroad.

They were the golden couple in school, famous throughout.

Jasper's deep affection for Adeline was known school-wide.

Even after being with me, Adeline still had a place in his heart.

Adeline was his youthful regret, and I was merely his reluctant choice.

"Alright, Jasper, let go of me. Your wife is still here," Adeline said playfully.

Jasper gazed at her lovingly, then turned to me, his eyes instantly cold: "What are you doing here?"

A dull pain surged in my heart.

"Were you here to deliver lunch?" Adeline naturally took the lunchbox from my hand.

Opening it, her eyes were full of disappointment: "This again?"

"I'm tired of it," she pouted to Jasper.

I was stunned: "You're... tired of it?"

"Yes, I said the cafeteria food was bad, so Jasper gave me his lunch. Didn't he tell you?"

Jasper admitted nonchalantly: "Yeah, Adeline's tired of it. Make different dishes next time."

He picked up his coat, stepped forward to hold Adeline's hand: "Let's go, we're eating out."

"What about this lunchbox?" she waved the lunchbox in her hand.

"Throw it away," Jasper said casually.

"It's not that good anyway."
