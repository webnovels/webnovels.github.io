No sooner had I packed the watch than Mr. Davies came in with a parcel.

"Mr. Alex, this package arrived with some damage. The delivery person requested a direct signature. Could you please check if there's anything wrong inside?"

I took the package Mr. Davies handed me, feeling suspicious. I hadn't ordered anything recently.

I instinctively knew it couldn't be from Victoria, as she never ordered things online; I personally bought all her daily necessities. She wouldn't touch such things.

It wasn't until I saw the recipient's name on the package that my shocked expression softened. It was Victoria's package.

At Mr. Davies' urging, I opened the box. Inside were two pairs of children's shoes.

Mr. Davies also looked a little shocked. "This… could Miss Victoria be pregnant? Didn't she say she could never—"

Before Mr. Davies could finish, Victoria's call came through.

Her voice was a mix of urgency and nervousness.

"Alex, did a package just arrive at the house? Did you…"

Before she could finish, I already knew what she was going to say. Looking at the children's shoes in the box, I calmly replied,

"Just received it. Don't worry, I've already signed for it."

She paused, then after a long silence, said, "Good. Don't overthink it. Those are gifts for a friend's kids. He helped me out a lot before; I'm just showing my appreciation."

I couldn't help but sneer when I heard that. They were clearly for Julian's twin sons, and she was still making up excuses.

I couldn't resist snapping back, "That friend of yours, is his name Julian?"

At my words, Victoria's tone immediately changed. "Alex, what are you stirring up now? Are you mad I didn't spend your birthday with you? Didn't I promise you? I'll make it up to you when I'm back from my time off."

"Stop dragging Julian into everything! How many times have I told you, we're just friends!"

I gripped the gift box in my hand and asked with a laugh, "Then why are you so anxious to call back? Isn't it because you're afraid I'll go confront Julian?"

I expected her to lash out, but she just said a few casual words:

"You're being completely unreasonable. I was just worried you'd overthink it if you saw the package. I never imagined you'd think so little of me. Looks like my concern for you was completely wasted!"

I was somewhat surprised. In the past, whenever I mentioned Julian to her, she'd explode like a lit fuse.

But the doubt that had just arisen vanished the next second when I heard a child's tender voice through the receiver. I realized she hadn't changed; she just didn't want to argue with me in front of the kids.

Before I could speak, she hung up, leaving me with a dial tone.

She kept telling me that she and Julian were just friends, but then she went and had his children.

Were they really just friends?

Just then, Victoria's Ragdoll cat, Whiskers, suddenly ran over.

My eyes hardened, and I was about to leave, but it was too late. Red spots had already started to appear on my arm.

In moments, what were just a few scattered spots had spread all over my body. They were incredibly itchy, and there were even signs of swelling.

I'm allergic to cat hair, but Victoria insisted on keeping a cat, simply because Julian had given it to her.

I even gave her the silent treatment for a month because of it.

She just shrugged it off, a look of disdain on her face.

"It's just a little allergy, isn't it? I can just buy you some allergy medicine. Only a cold-blooded person like you would shut out such a cute cat!"

The swollen areas on my body were growing larger, so I quickly went to find allergy medicine.

But I rummaged through the medicine cabinet several times, and there was no allergy medicine inside.

I felt worse and worse, even my breathing became difficult, and my head felt heavier and heavier. The next second, I lost consciousness.

When I woke up, I overheard Mr. Davies on the phone with Victoria.

Mr. Davies was elderly and accustomed to using speakerphone. Victoria's cold voice, distorted by static, cut through the air:

"It's just a minor allergy. Is it worth calling me in the middle of the night for? Just buy him some allergy medicine! You've been with the Sterling family for years; do I still need to teach you such basic things?"

"And by the way, don't bother me with trivial matters like this ever again!"

Through the crack in the door, I saw Victoria had already hung up before Mr. Davies could even speak.

I let out a self-deprecating laugh. I should have expected this outcome. What was I still hoping for?

Mr. Davies came into the room, looking at me with sympathy.
