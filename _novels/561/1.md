Three gamblers, including myself, sat around the cramped card table.
Since we were playing a fast-paced game, two Kings, three 2s, and one Ace were removed from the deck. Each player received sixteen cards.
The card combinations included singles, pairs, three-of-a-kind with a kicker, four-of-a-kind with two kickers, straights (like a "plane with wings"), and four-card bombs.
Among all cards, three Aces were the highest, able to beat any combination.
Among single cards, the 2 was the highest.
Among four-card sets, the King was the highest.
Whoever held the 3 of Spades led the first hand.
While drawing cards, I meticulously watched Rocky's hands. I was absolutely certain he'd get the lead. As he shuffled, he’d subtly hooked a card with his pinky finger. Though he was quick, it didn't escape my notice.
Sure enough, Rocky chuckled.
He tossed out a 3 of Spades.
I was next. I played a 5.
Then it was Spike’s turn.
He did something completely unexpected: he slammed down a King.
I noticed Rocky's brow furrow.
He couldn't help but curse.
"A 5, and you waste a King on it? What a needless sacrifice of a strong card!"
With that King played, no one could top it.
The lead passed to Spike.
In that brief hand, I saw it: Spike and Rocky were putting on a show for me.
The more they acted, the more I felt something was off.
My father once told me that in this world, whether it's Pai Gow, Mahjong, or Poker,
Ultimately, you're playing against people.
For a grifter, technique always comes second.
First is reading people.
But you can't truly see into a person's heart; you can only rely on your gut.
When you feel like the people at the table are trying to trick you,
Trust your instincts.
I glanced at my hand; my cards weren't great.
That's why I needed to seize the lead, to buy myself time to think.
I had to find a way to prolong this hand. The longer it lasted, the more likely Rocky and Spike were to slip up.
In this world, no cheating technique is foolproof.
If you cheat, you will eventually be found out.
The only way not to lose is not to gamble at all.
From the moment I sat down at that table,
Rocky and I, only one of us was walking out of this card room intact.
So, when Spike threw out a pair of 5s,
I slammed down a pair of Kings.
Rocky hissed, like he had a toothache.
He licked his dry lips and squeezed out a single phrase from between his teeth: "Can't beat it."
Spike also shook his head, letting me lead.
After gaining the lead, I immediately played a pair of 5s, discarding my weak cards.
Rocky then played a pair of 7s.
Spike waved his hand, couldn't beat it.
I played a pair of 10s. While Rocky was thinking, I quickly started recalling the cards still in play.
No Aces.
No 2s.
Now, I was certain Rocky and Spike were working together to cheat. That meant 80% of the high cards were in Rocky's hand.
When he dealt the cards, he must have swapped them. In grifter's slang, that's called "card-switching" or "palming"—stealing crucial cards during the deal, then restoring the deck.
This technique only works in small card rooms like this.
In larger casinos, with hidden cameras and surveillance everywhere, such methods are impossible to pull off.
If the hidden cameras caught you in a big casino, they'd chop you to bits.
Breaking such a cheat isn't impossible, though.
I needed to take a gamble…
But if I lost… I might end up just like my father.
