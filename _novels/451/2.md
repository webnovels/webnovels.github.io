"What?" I was so shocked I flipped over and sat up on the massage bed. "Who authorized this?"

"It... it was Mr. Huo."

I unconsciously gripped my phone tighter. I had just announced Tiana's termination in the group chat, and he immediately promoted her to VP. This was an open declaration of war against me.

A few minutes later, Liam indeed published Tiana's promotion announcement on the company website. He even assigned his personal bodyguard to chauffeur Tiana to and from work from now on.

In Tiana's newly posted moments, she was wearing high-end jewelry and a custom gown, smugly drinking my prized vintage wine with Liam.

The whole company was gossiping that Liam was going to kick me out and install Tiana in my place.

I clenched my fists tightly. Since Liam was determined to push her, he couldn't blame me for not giving him face.

Half an hour after Liam's announcement, I immediately convened the board of directors and revoked Liam's authority over personnel appointments. Then I restructured the company departments, completely sidelining Tiana.

You want to be VP? Then be a figurehead to your heart's content!

I assigned all the difficult clients and challenging orders to Tiana to handle. Let's see if that empty VP title can make clients respect you.

After doing all this, I felt as exhausted as if I'd fought a battle. I went home and fell into a deep sleep.

Tonight was my father's 60th birthday banquet. Usually, I would bring Liam along to celebrate with him.

But this year, I didn't want to bring him anymore.

On the way to the Zhou residence, I had just finished selecting a gift when I received a call from the housekeeper.

"Miss, Mr. Huo and Miss Ruan have already arrived. The master asked me to check why you haven't come yet?"

My hand holding the gift box froze for a moment, anger immediately surging in my heart.

This pair of scumbags wasn't satisfied with disrespecting me at the company. They actually had to make trouble in front of my father.

I called the driver to rush back to the Zhou residence at top speed.

As soon as I entered, I saw Tiana sitting close to Liam in my seat.

This bitch's intention to take my place was clear as day.

My father didn't know about what had happened at the company these past few days. He still thought Tiana was my good friend and even smiled at her cheerfully.

I immediately darkened my face and walked straight behind Tiana: "Get lost. Who do you think you are to attend my family's private dinner, let alone sit in my seat?"

She looked embarrassed, glancing at Liam for help.

Liam tried to suppress his displeasure as he looked at me: "Mia, Tiana is just here with good intentions to wish your father happy birthday. How can you speak to her like that?"

He let out an angry huff, but this was at the Zhou residence, at my father's birthday banquet. As a junior, he couldn't argue with me for Tiana's sake.

He could only swallow his emotions and pull out a chair from the side for Tiana to change seats.

"Hmph, completely unnecessary."

A rat paying New Year's respects to a weasel - obviously up to no good!

I ignored him and had the servant bring a new chair. The one she sat on was too dirty for me.

Many prominent figures had come today. I didn't want to make the scene too awkward, so I planned to settle accounts with the two of them after the banquet was over.

When I went to the restroom midway through, I overheard Tiana complaining resentfully on her phone.

"Who does Mia Zhou think she is? She's just relying on having a good father. If I had her family background, I'd definitely be no worse than her!"

"Look at her arrogant attitude, with her nose in the air. Hmph, I'll teach her a lesson today!"

My heart sank immediately. I rushed out of the bathroom, but Tiana had already disappeared.

Back at the banquet, I saw her obediently pouring tea into my father's cup.

After filling the teacup, she took advantage of everyone's small talk to discreetly drop an inconspicuous white pill into the cup.

My heart plummeted. I quickly stepped forward to stop her.

But before I could open my mouth, I saw my father pick up the teacup and drain it in one gulp, even praising Tiana on the side for being so thoughtful.

"Dad, don't drink it! There's something wrong with that tea!"
