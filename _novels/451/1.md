I crossed my arms and smirked coldly: "Liam, you think it's just about the money?"

"This brand is exclusively for our high-end clients. What status does an intern have to wear the same jewelry as our VIP customers? What will the clients think?"

I looked down condescendingly at Tiana, who was hanging her head silently: "Some people just don't know their place. They think sleeping with the boss will let them climb the social ladder. Hah, a common whore can never become a phoenix."

Liam's face darkened, angrily throwing the black card at me: "That's enough, Mia! Even if Tiana made a mistake, she's just a young girl without all those ulterior motives you're imagining. These past few months, she worked so hard on company orders that she was hospitalized with a bleeding ulcer. As her boss, it's only right for me to reward her. You have no right to interfere!"

Liam was like a rooster on steroids, stubbornly refusing to back down in front of me.

Of course, he's the big hero in Tiana's eyes now. How could he lower himself to be henpecked?

I let out a cold snort, bending down to pick up the card and patting his face: "Liam, don't forget whose status gave you access to this black card. Don't act tough with me. Remember my warning."

Ignoring his iron-gray face, I glanced at Tiana, who looked like she wanted to bury her head in the ground: "Since Miss Ruan is so capable, as Mr. Huo says, then the company's orders will be up to you now."

Liam was furious to the extreme, quickly pulling Tiana away.

Watching their retreating figures, I immediately called the purchasing department: "Change the brand for the clients' exclusive jewelry. I find it inauspicious."

Just as I hung up, I received a message from a business partner: "Mrs. Zhou, this isn't very sincere of you. It's bad enough you didn't come to lunch, but you sent Mr. Huo with some green girl instead. Don't you take me seriously?"

I smiled and replied: "That's my husband's new mistress. Old Zhang, bring out all your lecherous old men who like to get handsy and drink. I'll give you an extra 5% profit next time."

Seeing the "OK" gesture he sent back, I leisurely found a spa and started getting a massage.

I was about to doze off when Liam's calls started bombarding my phone.

As soon as I answered, his piercing roar came through. I had to lower the volume.

"Mia, you're deliberately targeting Tiana, aren't you?"

"Old Zhang refused to sign unless Tiana fed drinks mouth-to-mouth to over a dozen men. It was bad enough that they groped her all over, but then they wanted to take her to a hotel, saying all her orders were obtained by sleeping around!"

"They even insulted me, saying I'm a kept man who can't even properly leech off a rich woman, and that I should go be a male model instead!"

"This must be your doing behind the scenes. I never thought you'd stoop so low!"

I comfortably turned over: "They're just talking nonsense. How can you take it seriously?"

"Or... did they hit the nail on the head?"

The other end was so angry his breathing became rapid:

"What nonsense are you spouting! If it weren't for you, this order wouldn't have fallen through. Tiana cried her eyes swollen. Are you satisfied now?"

I couldn't help but smile: "I just wanted you to see your true place. Without me, you're nothing."

Liam was so angry he was speechless, abruptly hanging up the phone.

I opened the video Old Zhang sent me, watching the whole thing with satisfaction before forwarding it to the company group chat.

"Intern Tiana is incompetent. She engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior during negotiations, violating company policies. She is hereby terminated effective immediately."

HR received the directive and immediately removed Tiana from the work system.

I thought Liam would behave after this lesson, but I didn't expect him to be even more outrageous than I imagined.

A few minutes later, HR called me nervously: "Mrs. Zhou, something terrible has happened. Tiana has been promoted!"

"Promoted? She had a baby?"

"No, promoted to Vice President!"
