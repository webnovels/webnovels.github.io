My stepsister, Esme, has dissociative identity disorder and becomes violently aggressive whenever she sees me. She once attacked me with a knife, leaving me severely injured. Yet, my father and brother blamed me for provoking her.
"You know Willa can't handle stress. Why did you have to show up in front of her?"
"Willa has nothing, unlike you. As her sister, you should let her have the family home."
These accusations took a toll on me, and I developed a severe mental disorder. Even my childhood fiancé fell for my stepsister, leaving me for her and holding a lavish wedding. Unable to cope with his betrayal, I lost my composure and caused a scene at their wedding. I was subsequently locked in a psychiatric hospital, where I died in misery. Meanwhile, my stepsister enjoyed the wealth I left behind, adored by my family and fiancé.
When I opened my eyes again, I found myself back at the moment when Esme was brandishing a knife, demanding I leave the house. This time, I vowed to see which was stronger: her disorder or my resolve!
1. "Get out!"
"This is my home. I will not let an outsider like you set foot in here!"
Esme's demeanor changed drastically upon seeing me. She picked up a fruit knife from the table and lunged at me. I was ready, sidestepping her attack and then kicking her hard. She crashed to the ground, too pained even to groan. I bent down, picked up the dropped knife, and waved it in the air.
"Where were you aiming just now? The arm, neck, or... the heart?"
I said as I approached Esme with a cold smile. My actions terrified everyone else in the room. My stepmother rushed to shield her with her body, screaming. My father glared at me sternly and scolded me harshly.
"Lydia, what madness is this? Willa has dissociative identity disorder; she's ill. Why argue with her?"
"Your mental state is even more unstable. You seem more like a mental patient than Willa!"
My brother, Jasper, grabbed my hand holding the knife tightly, glaring at me with disdain. "Lunatic!" he spat. Instead of getting angry, I laughed hysterically, tears streaming down my face. Yes, I had lost my mind, driven there by them! In my previous life.
When mom died in a car accident, dad managed Lydia Corp alone, working late into the night. I felt sorry for him and couldn't stop him from remarrying. His new partner was his long-time secretary. To blend into the family more easily, my stepmother had her daughter change her name to match his surname. Esme was the opposite of my quiet nature, sweet and understanding, quickly winning Jasper's approval. They were closer than I, his biological sister, could ever be.
Despite feeling sorry for mom, I tried to accept the new family members. But no matter how friendly I was, Esme always showed hostility toward me. My stepmother explained that Esme had been triggered in childhood, developing dissociative identity disorder. Her second personality would emerge when sensing malice. This condition was like an excuse for everything. Esme shredded my clothes, and they sided with her. She destroyed all of mom's relics, and they sided with her. She didn't allow me into this house, stabbed me, and they still sided with her.
In my past life, I nearly died at this moment. When I finally regained consciousness, I was met with harsh reproach.
"You know Willa can't handle stress. Why do you keep showing up in front of her? Are you trying to push her to her death?"
"Willa has nothing, unlike you. Why can't you give her the family home?"
Esme felt so guilty for injuring me that she self-harmed. Dad and my brother blamed me for everything, hating me to the core, constantly abusing me verbally. Even when they learned I had a mental disorder, they didn't stop mocking me.
"We only said a few things, and you can't handle it? Lydia, if you're pretending to be sick, at least be convincing."
"Do you think you can take our love for Willa by being sick? Wishful thinking!"
My childhood sweetheart, Declan, also thought I was being unreasonable and insisted on calling off our engagement, only to announce his upcoming wedding with Esme. On their wedding day, everyone was happy for the couple, except me. I couldn't accept Declan's betrayal and mentally collapsed, repeatedly asking, "Why do you love Esme and not me?" My crazed state terrified the guests. To maintain order, Declan and my family teamed up to have me institutionalized. There, I suffered inhumane treatment and soon died miserably.
Perhaps my resentment was too strong because my soul lingered around Esme after death. I watched her enjoy the enormous wealth I left behind, adored by my family and fiancé. Her life was happy and satisfying, and her violent second personality never appeared again. My family also tacitly never mentioned it. Until I overheard her talking with my stepmother.
"Mom, thanks to your brilliance in having me fake dissociative identity disorder, I could drive that wretch Lydia out and live such a good life!"
My stepmother was quite pleased.
"After enduring humiliation for so many years, we finally got what we wanted."
"It's just a pity that old hag died too early to see her suffering and regret."
The mother and daughter laughed together. That's when I realized Esme never had dissociative identity disorder. The pretense was revenge against mom, to take everything from her!
Gideon knew all about this. He craved power, married into Lydia's family, but couldn't let go of his first love. They kept in touch secretly and had an illegitimate daughter. Just when he struggled to keep the secret, mom died unexpectedly. He was overjoyed and hurriedly arranged formal identities for the mother and daughter. To compensate for the grievances they suffered over the years, he chose to sacrifice me without hesitation.
Luckily, I was given a chance to start over. This time, I won't foolishly waste time and energy on unattainable love and family affection. I will expose Esme's facade and guard mom's wealth in Lydia Corp! With this in mind, I couldn't bear to wait any longer. I raised my free hand and slapped Jasper hard. Since they called me crazy, I'll show them just how crazy I can get!
2. Jasper was stunned by my slap. I took advantage of his daze to easily free myself from his grip. Realizing what happened, Jasper furiously wanted to retaliate. But I was quicker than him. With a sharp slap, the other side of Jasper's face swelled up quickly, creating a kind of symmetry.
I was quite satisfied with my handiwork, though the one being hit didn't think the same. He was furious, determined to teach me a lesson. I wouldn't give Jasper that chance. With a twist of my wrist, the sharp knife tip pressed against his vulnerable throat. Jasper's face turned pale instantly, and his voice trembled.
"Murder is illegal! Lydia, calm down!"
I took the opportunity to remind him. "I forgot to mention, I do have a mental disorder. When I have an episode, I can't control my actions. I'm the kind who won't go to jail even if I kill someone."
"So, Jasper, stop provoking me. Got it?"
With the blade so close, Jasper nodded repeatedly, unable to utter a word of defiance. Seeing he was sensible for once, I silently withdrew the knife. There were others I needed to deal with, so I decided to let him go for now.
With the immediate threat resolved, my stepmother immediately spoke in her exaggerated, affected tone.
"Though you're reclusive and sullen, you've been pampered since childhood. How could you have such an illness? It must be quack doctors tricking you for money!"
"Don't worry, mom will find another doctor for you."
In the past, I would have been moved by her display of concern. But now, I immediately recognized her jealousy of my material conditions. I glanced at Gideon. As expected, I saw intense guilt and remorse in his eyes. It disgusted me so much that I immediately mocked him.
"Don’t act all motherly."
"You, a low-class thing, aren't worthy of associating with me!"
My stepmother gritted her teeth in anger. But she had to maintain her dignified and virtuous image in front of Gideon. She could only forcefully suppress her temper, lower her head, and pretend to wipe away non-existent tears.
Gideon was heartbroken. Pointing his finger at me, he started cursing.
"Lydia, watch your mouth!"
"Even if you don't want to accept Esme, it doesn’t change the fact that she’s my lawfully wedded wife, your stepmother, and your elder!"
"As a dignified lady, shouting like a shrew, what does it look like? You've disgraced me!"
"Apologize now! Or I'll pretend I never had a daughter like you. Get out of this house immediately!"
I snorted disdainfully.
"My mom went through all the trouble to give birth to me, not you, who only cares about having a good time!"
"Do you think I care about being your daughter?"
"And I should remind you, this is Lydia's family estate. You’re a Gideon. If anyone should leave, it's you, not me!"
Gideon didn't expect me to defy him too. Trembling, he kept cursing me as a brat. I was tired of listening and coldly interrupted.
"If you want me to be filial, it’s not impossible."
"When you're dead, I can, for the sake of being father and daughter, burn some money for you."
"For example, like this..."
Saying that, I took out some leftover ceremonial paper money, lit it with a lighter, and tossed it over. My aim was excellent, hitting Gideon squarely. The flames spread along his clothes. Gideon started screaming and rolling on the ground, trying to put out the fire.
Gideon never imagined I would stand up to him. His hands trembled as he called me a bastard over and over. I was tired of listening, so I cut him off coldly.
"If you want me to show filial piety, it's not impossible."
"Maybe when you die, I'll burn some money for you out of our father-daughter connection."
"Like this..."
With that, I pulled out some spirit money I had left over from a ritual and set it on fire with a lighter before tossing it at him. My aim was precise; it landed straight on Gideon. The flames quickly spread across his clothes. He screamed in agony, rolling on the ground trying to extinguish the fire. My stepmother and Jasper rushed over in a panic, creating a scene of chaos. That's exactly what I was waiting for!
As their attention was focused on Gideon, I turned back to Esme.
"Finally, we can continue."
Her expression remained angry and fierce, but if you looked closely, you could see the fear in her eyes. She was scared. Afraid I might really kill her. I looked down at her, savoring the moment. Then I tightened my grip on the knife and lunged at her with force!
In a life-and-death moment, Esme unleashed unexpected strength and narrowly avoided a fatal blow. The knife only grazed her arm. Fortunately, I had used considerable force, and her wound was deep. In the blink of an eye, blood poured out like a stream, pooling on the floor. She screamed in pain. The others heard the commotion and rushed over much faster than I had anticipated. I had to abandon the idea of finishing the job. Before I could escape, Jasper grabbed my hair.
"Lydia, are you looking to die?"
His eyes were red with anger.
His hand tightened around my neck, and the suffocating sensation overwhelmed me. My hands fell weakly, and the knife dropped to the ground. At that moment, my own brother genuinely wanted to kill me!
In my past life, when Esme hurt me, it was considered my fault. In this life, when I hurt her to protect myself, it was unforgivable. In my family's eyes, Esme was always pure and good; no matter what, everything was my fault. How ridiculous is that? Luckily, I no longer yearn for their love. With effort, I opened my mouth:
"If you kill me, they won't make it either."
"Before I die, I can take two more down with me. It's worth it."
Jasper followed my gaze. Esme lay in a pool of blood, barely breathing. Gideon was drenched, his chest blackened, his condition uncertain. My stepmother was a mess, crying in panic. Every extra minute we delayed added more danger. Jasper didn't dare engage with me further. He tossed me aside like trash. I gasped for the precious fresh air, coldly watching Jasper scramble around. Before leaving with the medical staff, he threw one last sentence at me.
"Lydia, just you wait, this isn't over!"
Threatening me?
Someone who's already faced death once doesn't fear threats. My eyes were filled with murderous intent. This isn't over by a long shot!
As soon as Jasper and the others left, I had the locks changed. Once that was done, I discovered Esme's name dominated dozens of trending topics. I almost forgot she was a beauty influencer with millions of followers. The most popular video showed Esme lying in a hospital bed, her delicate face devoid of color. Even so, she forced herself to endure discomfort and sincerely apologized.
"I've suffered severe injuries. After careful consideration, I've decided to take a break and recuperate."
"Thank you to my fans for understanding. Also, please don't blame my sister. She just couldn't accept that the family's love for her was divided by me, and she lost control, which led to hurting me."
"I believe Sister Lydia didn't do it on purpose!"
Her choked-up voice, along with tears in her eyes, made Esme seem extremely vulnerable and pitiable. Fans, seeing her being wronged, quickly used their skills to dig up all my dirt. My reputation was dragged through the mud: insulting the stepmother, setting fire to the father, injuring the stepsister with a knife... Each incident made onlookers question if a person could truly do such things. Righteous netizens flooded my comments section.
"Willa and her mom just joined this family, not to ruin it. Is it necessary to be so hostile?"
"Your own mom died, and you can't stand others being happy. You're sick, no wonder you're always going crazy."
"My girl Willa is the most beloved in the world, your jealousy is useless!"
"Spoiled, ruthless, inhumane... No combination of bad words can fully describe your malice!"
The unpleasant comments were endless. I scanned through them with a blank expression, filled with overwhelming hatred. Again, it's the same! Clearly, Esme was wrong first. But as soon as she put on another face, played innocent, and acted weak, everyone sided with her, sympathizing with her. Having just saved my life, she immediately provoked me. Does she think the lesson wasn't enough? Then I'll make sure Esme remembers it well!
I drove to the hospital. Before I even entered, I could hear laughter and joy from inside.
"Willa, you can't move your hand yet. Don't push yourself. Let Declan feed you."
Faced with Declan's domineering yet gentle demand, Willa didn't know how to refuse, and sweetly agreed.
"Then I'll trouble you, Declan ~"
Her drawn-out tone was enough to make anyone's heart melt. Where was the slightest hint of the grievance shown in the video? I raised an eyebrow, pushed the door open, and saw the two on the bed kissing passionately. You could even hear the sticky, intimate sounds echoing in the room. Mouth to mouth. So that's how he was feeding her. I suppressed my disgust and snapped several photos.
After the kiss ended, Declan finally noticed my presence. His previously smiling eyes turned icy the moment he saw me. His voice carried a bone-chilling coldness.
"What are you doing here?"
"You're not welcome here, get out!"
I laughed mockingly.
"What, did I interrupt your little affair?"
"Having an affair in broad daylight without shame, but embarrassed when caught? What's the act for?"
I spoke with no mercy. Declan, embarrassed and angry, shouted with a red face.
"Lydia, what nonsense are you spouting?"
"I'm only atoning for your crime! You're the one who went crazy and hurt Willa!"
"People with dirty minds see everything as dirty!"
Esme, on the other hand. Her eyes burned with intense hatred as she threw a bowl of chicken soup at me. I sidestepped it. The porcelain bowl shattered, and the hot soup splashed everywhere. Declan was used to Willa attacking me on sight. After all, in the lies Willa spun about her dissociative identity disorder, one point was her intense possessiveness over Declan.
She believed she was Declan's fiancée, and I was the homewrecker trying to interfere. So whenever she saw me, it was either endless insults or violent attempts to drive me away. Only when I completely disappeared from her sight would she return to normal. Declan's expression didn't change. He just leaned over to check if her wound was bleeding. Playing the role of a thoughtful fiancé to perfection. Once he saw no major issue, he relaxed. He continued to condemn me with a tone full of disdain.
"You know Willa gets emotionally agitated whenever she sees me talking to you. Yet you still provoke her. Are you trying to leave her with a permanent injury?"
"Lydia, you're too vicious!"
Meanwhile, Esme, frustrated by a missed attack, grew even more agitated and rushed at me without care.
"Interfering in my relationship, stealing my fiancé."
"Bitch! Homewrecker! Go die!"
I knew I couldn't count on Declan. Acting quickly, I bent down to pick up a shard of the broken porcelain bowl. Then I swiftly got up, seizing the moment, and grabbed the back of her neck. With a slight movement of my wrist holding the shard, a blood mark immediately appeared on Esme's slender neck. Her sharp, ear-piercing scream abruptly stopped. What followed was Declan's voice, altered by fear, calling my name repeatedly, urging me to calm down. I found it annoying. I tightened my grip on the shard, about to make a deeper cut. Suddenly, I spotted unexpected guests.
Jasper and my stepmother were at the front, uniformed police officers right behind them, with Gideon following, panting heavily. My stepmother wailed, "Let Willa go!" Jasper threatened fiercely, "Lydia, don't be arrogant! I've reported you for attempted murder. Your good days are over!" The police timely intervened, "Release the hostage! If you insist on harming others, I have the authority to shoot you dead!"
It appears that there is no original text provided for translation. Please supply the content you wish to be translated, and I'll be happy to assist.
As he spoke, he reached towards his waist, clearly intending to deal with me if I didn't cooperate.
I felt sure I could move faster than the police, but I wasn't willing to take the risk. Esme was still alive, and I wasn't ready to give up just yet.
After considering my options, I dropped the shards and pushed Esme away with disdain. "Tch, she's so hard to kill." She stumbled, nearly falling, but Declan caught her. Noticing her slight trembling, he comforted her with genuine concern.
With others around, Esme was cautious not to reveal her fake dissociative identity disorder act, so she only sobbed softly. From a hidden angle, she shot me a taunting glance, as if to say: The one you love has betrayed you for someone else, you pathetic fool.
Seeing that made my blood boil, and I wanted to lash out again. The police, sensing my intent, quickly handcuffed me. Declan finally relaxed, glaring at me with undisguised disgust and contempt.
"How could you be so cruel to your own sister, Lydia? You're heartless!" He didn't bother explaining the situation, just criticized and belittled me. My family didn't defend me either; they seemed to agree with him.
My stepmother declared righteously, "Lydia almost killed Gideon before; she probably has an antisocial personality disorder. Officer, you must keep a strict watch on her, don't let her harm others!"
Jasper nodded repeatedly, "Having such a troublesome sister is my misfortune. Thankfully, Willa is sweet and sensible, nothing like Lydia."
Finally, Gideon sealed it. "Lydia's actions are unforgivable. Let the law decide her fate!"
I was taken away by the police for attempted assault. As soon as the news broke, netizens were elated.
"Finally! The always-crazy Lydia is caught! Now my dear Willa can live happily ever after, and her fans are relieved."
"Serves her right! Anyone who harms our younger sister deserves to pay!"
"Hope Lydia stays in jail forever!"
Soon after, Declan made a public declaration of love. "For years, Lydia clung to me like a parasite, stopping me from being with the one I love."
"Now that Lydia is out of the way, I can finally give Willa the grandest wedding!"
Nora wasn't shy either, boldly responding. "The past hurts are hard to forget, but I'll cherish every day with my love from now on."
"I hope everyone can, like me, leave the gloom behind and embrace happiness!" Their statements fueled a public backlash against me.
"I can't believe Lydia interfered in Willa's relationship, how shameless!"
"Lydia is so vicious, not only stealing from family but also lovers. Thankfully she's caught and can't harm Willa anymore."
"With such trouble around, I can't imagine the hardship Willa endured at Lydia Corp all these years... My heart aches for our younger sister!"
To comfort her distressed fans, Esme decided to livestream her wedding, letting everyone witness her happiness. This decision was widely applauded.
Major media outlets eagerly covered this high-profile union of a wealthy young man and a wealthy heiress, gearing up for a big story.
And so, Esme's wedding day arrived amid great anticipation.
Esme appeared in a stunning gown. Her white dress and exquisite makeup made her look like a fairy from another world. Declan was mesmerized, reverently kissing her hand. "Willa, my bride, you look beautiful today."
Cameras flashed, capturing the beautiful moment. The livestream chat was filled with praise. Esme, basking in the adoration, finally spoke.
"Now, let's all look back at the journey Declan and I have taken." "I hope everyone, like me, never gives up no matter how hard it gets, and bravely pursues happiness!"
After her words, a pre-recorded sweet video of the two was supposed to play on the big screen. She would then marry the rich and handsome Declan, becoming the envy of all girls.
However, the screen showed Esme's twisted face instead. She tore up my mom's painting despite my pleas, tearing each piece while cursing. "What ugly paintings, such an eyesore!" But that wasn't enough. She took scissors and cut my clothes into shreds. "Why should you have what I don’t? I won’t allow it!"
She only stopped when my room was in shambles, satisfied, and threw herself pitifully into the late-arriving Jasper's arms. "My sister was flaunting her stuff, I was so envious. Then, I don't know how it ended up like this..."
With tear-filled eyes, I tried recounting the events. But before I could speak, Jasper harshly reprimanded me. "Enough! I don't want to hear your excuses for bullying Willa!"
"If you hadn’t provoked Willa first, she wouldn’t have damaged your stuff!"
The scene shifted to Gideon scolding. "It's just childhood sweetheart feelings. Is it more important than your sister?"
"Since Willa has chosen Declan as her childhood fiancé, you should give up the fiancé title."
"Instead of selfishly holding on and letting Willa be labeled a mistress!"
Then, the video showed Esme trying to stab me with a knife. Of course, Declan's cheating and blaming me for catching him didn't go unrecorded.
Every hurtful deed against me was captured in full.
Inside and outside, people couldn’t help but criticize.
"Oh my, you never know someone's true face. Didn't expect Esme to have two faces!"
"Turns out, Esme is the troublemaker, the mistress... Lydia has been bullied and jailed all along, how pitiful..."
"Throwing dirt online, bullying Lydia, stealing her lover and family, while pretending to be positive, making fools of us, Esme you're such a phony!"
Overwhelming scorn and disdainful looks deeply stung Esme. She tried to defend herself. "I’m sick, I have dissociative identity disorder."
"I just found out my other personality did so many horrible things to sister Lydia. After the wedding, I’ll definitely apologize to her in jail!"
Esme's tears flowed, making her seem like the victim. Her acting was impressive, and I clapped as I walked from the viewing room to the stage.
"No need to wait, apologize and kneel now."
"I will definitely… not forgive you!"
Seeing me, Esme looked like she saw a ghost. Her disbelief mixed with fear. Something was clearly wrong. A huge sense of panic overwhelmed her.
"Lydia, how are you here! You should be in jail!" Her shrill voice was unpleasant to hear.
People who were unsure before now had their minds made up.
Yet, some still blindly accused me, despite everything.
Jasper looked at me with hatred. "Lydia, how long will you target Willa?"
Declan, full of disdain. "Even if you ruined my wedding with Willa using dirty tricks, I won’t marry you, you scheming woman. Give up and stop pestering me!"
Gideon sternly ordered. "Lydia, I don’t care how you escaped, go back to serve your sentence! Lydia Corp can’t harbor lawbreakers!"
I shrugged and chuckled. "I told you, I have a mental disorder. Why don’t you believe it?"
Esme refused to accept reality, mumbling. "Impossible, this can’t be..."
Guests in the front row sneered. "Why not? Only you can be sick, and others can't? What a double standard, quite an eye-opener."
"If I were Lydia, under your daily oppression, I’d be even crazier!"
"Lydia was driven mad by your family! You can’t take responsibility, shame!"
Everyone chimed in, belittling Esme. Even those who defended her, like Declan, got scolded.
"A cheating jerk is no good either!"
"Brother's slap, dad's two slaps, Esme's a total disaster."
"Can't tell right from wrong, twisting the truth, the worst all together, no wonder you're a family!"
"Lydia was too normal for your family before, but now that she's sick, the whole family can go crazy together."
Esme was humiliated, her face flushed red. Under everyone's gaze, she only dared to glare at me covertly, not daring to act.
After all, with so many people around, including professionals, if she couldn’t hold back and hit me, everyone would know she was faking.
Trying to use dissociative identity disorder as an excuse to bully her non-blood-related sister. From now on, she’d be nailed to the pillar of shame, never to wash it off.
Seeing her daughter hold back her dissatisfaction, the stepmother was distressed. She quickly pulled out a diagnosis from her bag. On it, in black and white, it stated Esme had dissociative identity disorder.
"Willa is really sick, please be gentle with your words, don’t provoke her!"
The bright red seal looked quite convincing. People quickly shifted from disgust to sympathy. They didn’t even consider the possibility of a fake diagnosis.
I feigned regret. "So Esme really has a mental disorder."
Just wanted to use dissociative identity disorder as an excuse to bully her non-biological sister. From now on, she'll be forever marked by shame, never able to live it down. Seeing her daughter suppressing her resentment, the stepmother felt a deep heartache. She quickly pulled out a diagnosis certificate from her bag. In clear, stark letters, it stated that Esme was diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder. "Willa is truly ill, please, everyone, be gentle with her and stop provoking her!" The bold red stamp looked rather intimidating. The crowd's disdain swiftly turned to sympathy. No one considered that the medical record might be forged. I also put on a show of regret. "So Esme really has a mental disorder, huh." "It's a pity she can't be held accountable or brought to justice." The stepmother looked at me warily. "What do you mean?" My answer was a snap of my fingers. Simultaneously, a new video started playing on the big screen.
A pedestrian was hit on a rainy night. Then, Gideon and Celeste got out of the vehicle. "Such luck, not dead. What now?" "How about hitting again?" "Wouldn't that be too obvious?" While they were indecisive, a voice urged from inside the car. "Just run over directly."
