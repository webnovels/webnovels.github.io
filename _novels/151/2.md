Gideon looked at me, his eyes rarely serious. We locked eyes, mine resolute. As long as he said no, the pregnancy test result in my hand would still appear in front of him.

He touched his nose, lowered his head, seemingly thinking about something. My heart raced, staring at him intently, hope rising in my heart.

But in the end, he disappointed me. He nodded and said, “Yes.”

I let out a bitter laugh. What a clear answer from Gideon, just like that, denying our years of relationship, placing me in the position of a mistress.

It was like seeing clearly for the first time the man I had invested years in.

Seeing I didn’t react, he pulled me into his arms, helplessly persuading me as if he had no choice. “I’m just helping out at school here, my focus is still on the business world, and Lydia is my best match, equal in status.

But marrying her won’t affect our relationship, I promise I’ll ensure you graduate from your master’s smoothly.”

So, he thought I was with him just for my master’s degree? In his eyes, our relationship was just a transaction.

I pushed him away, tears welling in my eyes, biting my lip to hold them back.

“Since you only see benefits, then spend your life with your benefits. A person like you doesn’t deserve a family, much less a child!”

I put the pregnancy test result behind me. I already had the answer in my heart—this child, he doesn’t deserve to know about.

After hearing me out, he first looked at my hand behind me in confusion, then sneered, staring at me as if seeing through me. “Adeline, you’re right.”

“Yeah, I don’t deserve a child, just like you don’t deserve to marry into a wealthy family, otherwise in three years...”

Gideon’s eyes glanced at my belly, full of ridicule. “Why hasn’t there been any movement from your belly?

Otherwise, even if your belly was a little competitive, the position of Gideon’s daughter-in-law wouldn’t go to someone else, and I wouldn’t have to marry a woman I don’t love...”

While saying this, Gideon shrugged, the face I once liked for its carefree nature now full of helplessness. I instinctively retorted, “Who said my belly isn’t...”

I stopped myself in time, biting my lip.

I can’t let my child be seen as a bargaining chip. He stared at me, suddenly reaching out, grabbing behind me.

“Been watching you hold something since you came in, let me see?” My heart jumped, I immediately stepped back two steps, not wanting Gideon to find the pregnancy test result.

“Come on! Let me see!”

But the more I avoided, the more curious Gideon became, directly following up, holding me with one hand, reaching for the pregnancy test result in my hand with the other.

In the next second, the pregnancy test result was already in his hand.

“Give it back, you don’t deserve...” I hurriedly reached out to snatch it back, my mind full of thoughts about how Gideon doesn’t deserve to be this child’s father, and I don’t want my child’s father to be him either.

But how could I win against him?

Just as Gideon raised his hand to avoid my grab, about to open that pregnancy test result, seeing the child he'd been longing for about to appear before him, Gideon’s phone vibrated first.

He just glanced at the phone, then tossed the unopened pregnancy test result back to me. “Mysterious, don’t look if you don’t want to.”

Seeing the pregnancy test result tossed to the ground, the words “pregnancy test” glaringly obvious, I quickly ran over to pick it up. But in the next second, Gideon’s foot was already on top of it.

He handed me his phone. “Help me pick a nice wedding photo, it’ll be made into a poster for the wedding day.”

“Take your time choosing, I trust your taste.”

I squatted on the ground, looking up at him, tears inevitably falling. “So, you have to get married, right?”

Even knowing the answer, I couldn’t help but ask. I bit my lip, staring at Gideon, hoping for a different answer from him.

Gideon moved his foot, walked to the front door, and opened it.

Outside, at some point, it had started raining heavily. He glanced back at me, his eyes unreadable. “Why ask the same question again?”

The rain poured down harder, splashing on the ground. I then heard Gideon say, “My wedding is the day after tomorrow.

The marriage alliance with the Su family is my best choice, also the best choice for Gideon’s family.”

“Don’t worry, if you stay with me, I won’t treat you badly!”

“My wedding is the day after tomorrow!”

“Stay with me, I won’t treat you badly!”

Gideon stepped aside and walked to the front door, opening it swiftly.

Outside, it had begun to rain heavily at some point.

He glanced back at me, his eyes dark and inscrutable: "Why ask the same question again?"

The rain came down harder, splashing onto the ground.

Then I heard Gideon say, "My wedding is the day after tomorrow. This marriage alliance with Lydia's family is the best choice for both me and Gideon's family."

"Don't worry, if you stay with me, I'll make sure you're taken care of!"
