After five years of marriage, Zachary Smith turned our marital home into 99 themed rooms for his affairs. The models he brought back could open a nightclub in our house. I chose to turn a blind eye because of the child in my womb.

Later, he personally dressed me in a princess gown and took the dolled-up me to the hospital to shave my head bald. All to make a sick little girl smile. I didn't cry or make a fuss.

Until our anniversary, when the little girl insisted on going skiing. Zachary forced me to be there as a human cushion for Lily. On the slopes, Lily deliberately crashed into me, sending me flying. Blood gushed from beneath me.

I begged him to save our child, but he picked up the unharmed Lily and sneered at me: "Claire Johnson, you've lied more times than I've slept with you."

"If you're hurt, find the medical staff. Don't blame me for not acknowledging the child if you delay Lily's fun!"

On the way to the hospital, our baby died in my womb. Yet he let his friends laugh and bet on whether the child would survive.

I closed my eyes in despair: "Zachary, let's stop torturing each other. Let's get divorced."
