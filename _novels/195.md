In the fifth year of our marriage, I helped my wife's family business, which was on the verge of bankruptcy, go public.

At the celebration party, my wife showed up with a pair of twins and her much-admired ex-boyfriend.

She remarked, "Jack is a top student, and you should appreciate him for bringing in some fresh genes to improve the family line."

"You'll still stay with my family, and as a token gesture, one of the kids can take your last name."

She wanted me to step down from my Vice President position.

"The company's success has nothing to do with you. Even a pig can fly when there's a strong enough wind!"

"Replace you with Jack, and he'll do even better!"

Everyone was mocking me, and my father-in-law and mother-in-law, who always claimed to value me, silently agreed with everything.

Watching this shameless family, I sneered, "Fine, let the Anderson Group go bankrupt then!"
