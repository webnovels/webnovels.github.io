Back at the dorm, I found my phone flooded with calls from Declan.

I thought I had made the breakup clear.

Reflecting on recent events, I replied:

"Your cousin is not only more handsome but also richer than you. When he calls me 'sister,' I feel like giving him my whole life."

Almost instantly, the phone rang.

"Fiona, which cousin? Who are you giving your life to?"

I hung up, blocked the number, all in one go.

Exhaling deeply, I realized there was still a shadow outside the window.

Jasper?

I played the voice message he just sent.

His slightly hoarse voice scratched at my heart like rough sandpaper.

"Sister, come out."

He somehow got a cup of honey water.

The warm, smooth liquid carried the warmth of his chest.

"You drank tonight. Have some honey water; it will make you feel better."

I was surprised. How did he know...

Then I remembered the kiss with a hint of alcohol in the car.

The air around me heated up again, and my face must have been bright red.

The phone rang at just the right moment. It was Declan.

Jasper answered it right in front of me.

"Jasper, where are you?"

Jasper looked at me.

Even though we had broken up.

Why did it feel like I was caught cheating?

I could only bury my face in the cup.

Let the steam from the cup shield me.

"I'm with my fiancée."

Jasper replied naturally.

"Well, congratulations, you finally got what you wanted."

The person on the other end didn't say much more and hung up directly.

Jasper showed that enticing expression again.

The corners of his eyes were reddened, like a captivating demon.

His fingers intertwined with mine, holding tightly, his eyes pleading:

"Can we go public, Fiona?"
