"Fiona, are you out of your mind?" Declan snapped.

I shrugged. "Yeah, I'm from a poor background, that's just how we girls from humble origins are."

Declan seemed to realize something and quickly explained.

"Fiona, it's not what you think."

I gestured with my chin at his legs. Declan then noticed Adeline's stockings caught in his zipper, already torn.

I can't imagine what intimate things they did when I wasn't there.

"So only those who wear Chanel and carry Hermès deserve all your love?"

I shook my head regretfully.

Declan massaged his temples. "It was just a joke, do you have to take it so seriously, Fiona?"

"Can you say you wouldn't choose someone wealthier?"

"Isn't that just human nature?"

I blinked, "Is that so?"

Adeline chimed in, "Of course, if you compare the two of us, it's obvious who anyone would choose, right?"

She interlocked fingers with Declan, the shiny diamonds on her manicured nails dazzling my eyes.

I was stunned for a moment, then looked thoughtfully at my phone.

It was a new friend request from Jasper, with a straightforward note: "Hello, sister. Grandpa asked me to fulfill our marriage contract."

Jasper, known as the Capital Prince, is also a freshman this year, recognized as one of the wealthiest students on campus.

But he's usually low-key, always saying he has a marriage contract and doesn't interact much with girls.

So I only heard about him. But why did he suddenly add me? Could it be the person with a marriage contract with him is actually...

Hesitating, my phone kept vibrating.

Jasper: "Why is sister silent, still with the ex-boyfriend?"

"I have plenty of money, sister, won't you consider?"

"Sister, give me a chance?"

The usually cold Jasper called me sister repeatedly, completely unlike his cool image.

My face turned red, inexplicably imagining him calling me that in a more intimate setting.

Looking up again, I had made up my mind.

"Let's break up then."

"I choose the rich one too."

Declan laughed first, and others followed suit.

Everyone knows the Declan family is connected to the Aiden family, and it's hard to find someone richer than Declan in the whole school.

"Don't be ridiculous, Fiona. Richer people won't look at you."

"Come back and sit, I'll pretend you didn't say anything."

Looking at the dark water stain on the leather sofa next to him, I suddenly felt disgusted.

"No, thanks."

I took a step back, Declan's words about "gentle and soft" echoing in my mind.

If that's the case, rich guys should be even more fragrant and tender, right?

Before I knew it, I had already sent a reply to Jasper.

"Can you come pick me up, charming little prince?"
