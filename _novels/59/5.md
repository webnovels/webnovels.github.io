After Fiona left, Declan felt uneasy.

It was so late, and she was in the suburbs. How would a girl like her get home?

Oh well, perhaps it’s a lesson she needs to learn.

That's how it is in the upper circles, where interests come first.

She has to learn to adapt.

Deep down, he admitted he liked Fiona.

At the freshman orientation party, she wore a cream-colored cotton dress, looking as beautiful as a fairy.

Countless guys were eager to dance with her.

But her gaze drifted through the crowd and gently landed on him.

In that moment, the world quieted down to just breaths and heartbeats.

But from the moment Adeline appeared, everything seemed to change.

Adeline always wore exquisite brand-name outfits and carried the scent of high-end perfume.

Unlike Fiona, who carried a canvas bag from Amazon and occasionally asked him to help "cut a deal."

Until his mother told him that the family had chosen Adeline as his future wife.

He felt this was the right choice.

Only a girl like Adeline seemed suitable for him.

But tonight, with Adeline sitting astride him, it felt wrong.

Closing his eyes, all he could see was Fiona's stubborn eyes.

He couldn't help but call her.

No answer.

Forget it, let her cool off for a few days.

After all, she loves money so much.

In a few days, he's sure she'll come back.
