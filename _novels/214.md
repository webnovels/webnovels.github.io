Daughter's illness urgently needed money for treatment, but my wife held onto all my money and lavishly spent it on her wealthy new lover. 

I begged her to visit our daughter, but she threatened me to quit my executive position and become a servant for her new lover. Helplessly, I agreed, yet my wife went back on her word.

"I'm her mom, not a doctor. Visiting her won't cure her," she said. Later, our daughter passed away despite rescue efforts, calling for her mom until the end.

 At that moment, my wife was celebrating her marriage registration with her new lover. 

When I confronted her, she dismissed me with a light remark, "Stop using this to manipulate me."

She didn’t know yet that the man she painstakingly wanted to marry was a conman. I suppressed my hatred and called my boss at the police department.

 "All the evidence has been collected. We can proceed with the arrest."
