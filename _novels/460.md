The woman told me to run away quickly, or I'd be the next one locked up in here.
But when she saw my boyfriend, she threw herself at him.
Not in hysterical anger, nor in timid pleading.
Instead, she kissed him. So passionately, so tenderly.
It made my skin crawl and my breath stop.

0A skeletal woman was chained up in the basement.
Her cheeks were sunken, her body covered in bruises. An iron chain around her neck kept her tethered like a dog in the dark, sunless space.
I stood on the stairs, our eyes meeting. My breathing quickened for no apparent reason.
She seemed surprised to see me there.
I told her my boyfriend had brought me to his hometown to meet his parents. Just as I was about to ask who she was, she suddenly became hysterical upon hearing this.
She shouted at me: "Run! Get out of here now!"
Her sudden outburst startled me. With a trembling voice, I asked her why.
But her next words sent chills down my spine.
"Because if you don't leave, you'll be the next one locked up in here!"
