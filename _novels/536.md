I am Aria, the one with the purest bloodline in the Celestial Clan.

Yet on the day of my coming-of-age ceremony, the sacred beast I had nourished with my own essence since childhood denounced me as impure and unfit to lead.

Desperate to prove myself, I attempted to transform into my true form, only to become an ugly black serpent.

Meanwhile, Rose, the servant girl I had taken in as an adopted sister, revealed herself to be able to transform into the majestic form of our clan.

The sacred beast bowed at Rose's feet, sneering at me with disdain.

My father, enraged, disowned me on the spot.

And Blake, my childhood sweetheart and fiancé, berated me: "How dare a lowly black snake try to impersonate our heiress!"

I was scorned by thousands and exiled from the clan.

Driven out, I ultimately perished in a horde of wild beasts.

After death, I watched as Rose assumed my identity, married my fiancé, and became the revered heiress of the clan.

Given a second chance at life, I returned to the day of my coming-of-age ceremony.
