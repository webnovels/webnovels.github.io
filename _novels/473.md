One year into our marriage.
I found out my husband was actually a rich guy.
It’s just… he looked exactly like a guy in the financial newspaper.
When I confronted him, he just laughed and said, "Lots of people look alike, but not everyone has my eight-pack abs."
"..."
Ugh, he was so right.
I absolutely *loved* my husband's eight-pack abs.

"Violet."
Rhys’s arms wrapped tightly around my waist, his handsome face buried in my neck.
I heard his low chuckle and reached out to push him, but my hand landed right on those solid eight-pack abs.
A shock like electricity ran through my palm, my breath hitched, and my heart pounded.
"Rhys…" The word slipped from my lips, soft and sweet, my eyes swimming, practically dripping with desire.
He lifted his head, bracing himself on either side of me, hovering as he smiled. The slight upturn of his foxy eyes held a hint of raw desire, tinged with red.
His thin lips parted, and he lowered his head, kissing mine fiercely, taking charge without a moment's hesitation.
"Good girl, call me Daddy."
...
Just like that, I called him Daddy all night long.
The next morning, I almost missed work. When I finally dragged myself out of bed, my darling husband was still sprawled out, sound asleep.
Ugh, he looked like a god in repose, absolutely stunning.
Looks like it was up to me to bring home the bacon.
My best friend, Harper, said I was hopelessly gone, and I admit it. Ever since I met Rhys, I’d been a total prisoner of love.
"You're completely wrapped around his finger! That dog Rhys is like some manipulative siren, whispering nonsense in your ear, and you just do whatever he says without a second thought!"
Every time I met Harper, she called my husband a dog. I just put up with it. What else could I do? She’s been my best friend since we were kids.
"My lunch break is almost over. Can we talk about something else?" I checked the time. This woman had been going on for nearly an hour.
Harper sighed, her expression like she was thoroughly disappointed in me. "What is that dog Rhys even thinking, letting you, a woman, go out and earn money while he hides at home sleeping? What's up with that?"
"I'm happy to." Only I truly know what's best for me. Rhys has his good points, and others just wouldn’t understand.
Rhys and I met completely by chance. As the old saying goes, it was truly meant to be, the best possible arrangement.
A year ago, my company had a team-building trip to beautiful Miami Beach.
That evening, I was strolling along the shore by myself when I saw a crowd of people gathered, arguing loudly.
Right in the middle was Rhys.
Under the moonlight, his unfairly perfect face practically glowed like something carved from moonlight, looking awkwardly innocent. His long, slender fingers held a crab claw like it was a piece of art. He was wearing the most ridiculously loud Hawaiian shirt and baggy shorts, but on him, it looked unbelievably stunning.
It was love at first sight, and I was completely, hopelessly sunk. Like quicksand, there was no pulling me out.
Turns out, poor Rhys hadn't brought any money for dinner, and the owner thought he was trying to dine and dash.
Was there any justice in the world? What's wrong with a gorgeous person eating a little food?
I dug into my own wallet and helped him out.
But it hurt for a while because he’d ordered a whole king crab feast.
Harper said I was totally bewitched by Rhys. I couldn't help it. He was too handsome, and I was too much of a sucker for a pretty face.
He promised he’d pay me back, but I honestly never expected him to. I was playing the long game. There had to be a reason for us to meet again, right?
Then I found out we lived in the same city.
Fate is just like that, wonderfully mysterious.
Later, we got closer and closer. I felt the time was right to take things to the next level, but then I got nervous and totally butchered my words.
"Can we do, friends?"
