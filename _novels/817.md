Winona Jensen knew David Langley meant well. But she lowered her gaze to the silver ring on her finger, a flicker of emotion passing through her eyes. "There's no need to inform him. I've already decided to break up with him."

As she spoke, the unlocked wooden door creaked and swung open slightly. Logan Carrington stepped inside, dressed in a black T-shirt. He was tall and lean, his profile sharply defined. 

"Who are you talking to?"

Winona glanced up at him, then quickly found an excuse to end the call. "Just talking to my roommate about post-graduation plans."

Logan didn't press further. He walked over with a smile and pulled out a bracelet from his pocket, holding it up in front of her. "I worked a part-time job for a month to buy this for you. Do you like it?"

Winona glanced at it and replied flatly, "It's pretty."

Her unexpected indifference caught Logan off guard. In the past, she would eagerly accept whatever he gave her and embrace him with affection.

He studied her face carefully. "You don't like it?"

Winona shook her head. "I do like it. It's just too expensive. Don't buy gifts for me anymore. Let's save the money instead. Didn't we agree to buy a house and get married after graduation?"

So, that was it. She was upset because he had spent money recklessly again.

Logan couldn't help but chuckle. He gently ruffled her hair. "It's fine. Worst-case scenario, I'll just pick up a few more part-time jobs. Whatever other women have, you should have too."

Winona glanced at the clock on the wall with a smirk on her face and went to wash up.

After the door closed, she walked to the mirror and noticed Logan's phone on the sink buzzing with a new message. She picked it up and tapped the screen, only to see a familiar profile picture pop up with a message.

"Logan, thank you for the latest Bvlgari necklace you gave me today. I love it."

The lighting in the attached photo was dim, but it couldn't hide the dazzling sparkle of real diamonds.

Winona smiled quietly at the cheap bracelet that cost 9.99 dollars tossed on the table. It had even come with free shipping.

Steam billowed, filling the air. She stared at the gradually blurring face in the mirror as fragments of memory slowly surfaced in her mind.

Logan transferred to the finance department of Stellanridge University two years ago, instantly drawing attention with his striking looks. However, he unexpectedly started pursuing Winona, an ordinary girl who only stood out for her excellent grades.

The two of them got to know each other and began dating just like any typical young couple, enjoying moments of holding hands, sharing kisses, going out on dates, and taking leisurely walks together.

A year ago, the two of them moved out of the dorms and started renting a low-cost apartment for 700 dollars, officially living together. They promised to buy a house and get married after graduation.

To fulfill that promise, Winona took on part-time work whenever possible, juggling three jobs a day to make their dream come true sooner.

Yet, three days ago, during a delivery run to a bar, she unexpectedly encountered Logan, who was supposed to be at work. He stepped out of a sports car, laughing and chatting with a group of his friends as they swaggered into the bar.

She passed by with her helmet on and happened to overhear their casual chatter.

"Logan, how much longer are you gonna keep up this act with your poor girlfriend? If she ever finds out who you really are, her eyes would probably pop out of her head."

"Well, what can he do? Logan has been crushing on Naomi Ashford. If Naomi hadn't insisted on dating some cheap nobody, Logan wouldn't have gone and picked Winona just to spite her."

"Cramming into that dump with a poor woman… I'd go insane. But not Logan. Josmere's golden boy stuck it out for three years just to stay close to Naomi. Now that's commitment."

Amidst the ridicule and taunts, Logan sat comfortably, casually sipping his drink and remaining silent.

At that moment, Winona realized her boyfriend, whom she thought was from a similar background to her, was actually the golden boy of Josmere. And Naomi, her best friend, was actually the socialite of Josmere. 

Naomi had also transferred to their department two years ago. When she first arrived, she was unfamiliar with the place and a bit spoiled. Winona had been the only one willing to look after her. Over time, the two of them grew close.

From the very beginning, Winona knew Naomi had come to this university for her boyfriend, a guy named Edmund Brown. What she never expected was that Logan transferred to Stellanridge University for Naomi.

Ultimately, it became clear that the person Logan genuinely loved from start to finish was none other than his childhood sweetheart, Naomi. He chose Winona as his girlfriend solely to get back at Naomi, seeing her as a suitable choice because she was some poor nobody. 

She could barely recall how she had left that bar. All she knew was that she wandered aimlessly through the rain all night, getting herself soaked to the bone. She was dazed and lightheaded, feeling as if she had left half her life behind on the pavement.

When she got back, the fever hit. Her dreams twisted between sweet memories of their love and nightmares of betrayal, over and over again.

She held out alone in that shabby little apartment for three days. Logan never came back.

The fever broke, and her body finally cooled. However, when she gazed at the photo Naomi had shared and caught a glimpse of Logan's hand feeding her oatmeal, an unexpected stillness enveloped her.

That was the moment her heart gave out. She was tired of being forced to go along with someone else's love story.

She and Logan were never from the same world to begin with. There was no point in forcing her way in.

If Logan wanted to keep up the act, so be it. This time, Winona would be the one to make the first move and walk away.
