I, Olivia Winchester, was abducted and sold when I was a little kid. After I managed to escape with great difficulty, I found out that I was actually the real daughter of the Winchester family.
But my biological parents didn't love me. Instead, they doted on their fake daughter, Shirley Winchester.
During an emergency surgery, my mom and dad had put on their protective suits. And my brother, Isaac Winchester, clung tightly to Shirley, shielding her and insisting that she shouldn't be the one to do this surgery.
Yet, not a single person bothered to tell me that the patient had AIDS and that the doctor performing the operation needed to wear protective gear.
Just like that, I was left exposed to the patient with my wounds out in the open.
After going through such a life-and-death ordeal, what little affection I had for my family was completely drained, and I finally gave up on them.
After the surgery was over, I calmly picked up the phone and made an anonymous tip. "I want to report a colleague for deliberately concealing the patient's medical history, which put me at risk of being exposed to AIDS."
