I knelt in the snow for as long as Julian and Melody were together.

Three days and three nights passed, and I had completely lost all sensation.

When the staff carried me into the mansion, Julian was getting out of Melody's bed, looking utterly satisfied.

Seeing me, his brow furrowed, and a rare flicker of worry and unease crossed his usually indifferent eyes.

He lost control, shouting at Mr. Charles, the butler:

"Where's the doctor?! Get the doctor here now!"

By the time the family doctor, Dr. Miller, arrived, I was on the brink of death.

Just then, a loud crash came from Melody Hayes's room.

Followed by her cry of pain:

"Julian, I accidentally fell! It hurts so much!"

Julian instantly panicked.

"Dr. Miller, come with me, quickly, to help Melody!"

Dr. Miller hesitated for a moment.

My skin had taken on a waxy, grayish-white pallor. If I wasn't treated immediately, I would surely die.

He explained my critical condition to Julian, but Julian simply brushed it off.

"Her life's a tough one."

I fought to remain conscious until Dr. Miller returned, though by then, my awareness was fading.

Julian and Melody came in with him.

Melody looked at my frostbitten body, a flash of surprise in her eyes.

Then she abruptly pushed Dr. Miller aside and began rubbing my hands together.

Dr. Miller frantically called out to stop her, but it was too late.

A large patch of skin had already been rubbed off my left hand.

With severe frostbite, rubbing the skin is strictly forbidden; it only causes secondary damage.

I found it hard to believe Melody didn't know this basic first aid.

Excruciating pain shot through my left hand, and I bit down hard, clenching my teeth.

Dr. Miller immediately rebuked Melody.

"Ms. Hayes, what are you doing?! This will only make her condition worse!"

Julian watched my tormented expression, his brow furrowing, and for once, he even criticized her.

"Melody, couldn't you have waited for the doctor?"

Melody's eyes instantly welled up.

"But I didn't know it would be like this! I just wanted to help Aubrey!"

Hearing her, Julian’s heart immediately softened.

He pulled the crying Melody into his embrace, comforting her.

"Don't cry, Melody. It's not your fault. Did it scare you?"

Then he turned to me, his voice dismissive.

"I'll get you the best medicine and resources to save you. Just forgive Melody; she meant well."

"Anyway, you survived the pain of having your uterus removed. This is nothing."

With that, his warm fingers wiped away Melody’s tears.

Melody, fresh from crying, looked utterly pathetic and adorable.

Julian’s voice was a little husky, teasingly caressing Melody's nose.

"Such a cute little crybaby, is someone getting a little... aroused?"

Melody's face flushed crimson, and she clenched her fists, playfully punching Julian’s chest.

"Someone's here, Julian, don't be like that!"

"This mansion, I call the shots."

When the ambulance Dr. Miller called arrived, Julian swept Melody into his arms and hurried into the master bedroom.
