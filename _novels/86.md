Everyone knew that Harrison, the billionaire CEO, had a precious little girl he doted on. This girl, Lily, was spoiled rotten, like the protagonist of a novel, indulged by everyone.

Everyone except me.

On our wedding day, Lily, wearing a white wedding dress, looked at me with a challenging expression:

"Only those who aren't loved are the other woman."

"So what if you marry Harrison? I'll still be the woman he cherishes most!"

Hearing this, I smirked and turned to Harrison, slapping him hard across the face:

"Are you deaf? Your mistress is right here causing trouble, and you're just standing there?"
