In the haze, I saw those dark eyes, brimming with concern. A wave of warmth surged through my chest, and the drowning sensation vanished instantly. I reached out, my fingers brushing against something soft and furry.

A clear, melodic female voice spoke: "Seraphina, you haven't repaid what you owe me yet. You're not allowed to die."

 The voice was utterly unfamiliar. How did she know my name? Through the blur, those dark eyes sharpened into focus.

When my senses fully returned, I found myself in an unfamiliar room. Beside my bed sat the General's wife of the Whispering Woods Tribe. 

As a child, our families had been close, and my grandfather often brought me to meet the General and his wife. 

Elder Elara, seeing me awake, was overjoyed. "She truly didn't deceive me," she murmured.

When I questioned her, Elder Elara simply told me to rest and heal. I would know everything once I recovered.

The Whispering Woods Tribe were the humans most deeply connected to nature's essence. Here, I received excellent care, and my body recovered day by day. 

Elder Elara also informed me that she hadn't heard anything about the Queen searching for me.

Ignoring Elder Elara's pleas, I decided to return to the capital. To the rhythm of drums and strings, a masked woman in red danced gracefully. 

Three fox tails swayed behind her. Beneath her white mask, a pair of upward-tilting eyes shimmered like water. I was mesmerized. 

Among the beast-kin, foxes were known for their striking beauty, so I presumed she was from the Foxkin tribe. 

To my surprise, the Foxkin, with whom I'd had no prior contact, presented her to me as a companion for my return journey. 

Before I departed, Elder Elara gravely advised me: if I ever faced danger, I *must* return with the beast-kin, Elysia.

The masked woman silently met my gaze. I nodded, and together, I took the fox-kin back to the capital.
