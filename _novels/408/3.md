Every time I returned to the capital with my forces, the city would be adorned with festive lights and banners, but never once was it for me.

This time was no exception. When I appeared, the city guards bowed respectfully, not daring to impede me.

 I entered the palace unimpeded, only to find this was Queen Aethelred's grand celebration. 

She had finally gotten her wish: her 'true love' had ascended to the Consort Queen's throne, to stay by her side.

With the new Consort Queen's ascension and *my* sudden appearance, the grand hall erupted in a commotion. 

The old ministers whispered frantically, debating how to respond in accordance with ancient laws.

Queen Aethelred, a rare look of joy on her face, hurried down from the high platform. 

She rushed towards me, then reined in her smile, preemptively demanding, "Where have you been all this time? I thought you were dead!"

Before I could even open my mouth, Elysia, behind me, let out a disdainful snort.

Lyra Vane then approached, observing Queen Aethelred's expression before turning to me with feigned concern.

 "It's good you're back, Sister. The Queen was very worried about you."

I gazed at the familiar wedding decorations around us, then glanced at the diadem on Lyra Vane's head. I let out a soft, hollow laugh. "Oh, really?"

Our ancestral teachings demanded I dedicate myself entirely to the Queen's dynasty, just like my forebears.

 I was to embody the ideal Consort Queen, bringing stability and peace to the people. 

But now, it seemed I had married the wrong person and failed in my sacred duty.

Queen Aethelred, too, glanced at the diadem. Her voice was laced with frantic urgency as she defended, "That's not *your* diadem."

Elysia seemed to have had enough. "Of course not. Why would a new love wear an old crown? An old flame can't compare to a fresh one."

I put a hand on Elysia's arm, my gaze fixed on Queen Aethelred. I spoke just three words: "I want a divorce."

Since the founding of the kingdom, no Consort Queen had ever dared to propose a divorce. 

Wouldn't this be a direct affront to Queen Aethelred's authority? 

But I, Seraphina Thorne, had served the kingdom and its people flawlessly since becoming Consort Queen. The Queen had no grounds to dismiss me.

 In the past, Queen Aethelred had abandoned me to die, and today, she disregarded my honor so brazenly, shaming my ancestors. I absolutely would not tolerate it any longer.

My declaration sent shockwaves through the hall. 

The elderly ministers seemed more agitated than Queen Aethelred herself, rushing forward to plead, "No, Your Majesty, you mustn't!"

Lyra Vane, however, watched Queen Aethelred's reaction with an almost gleeful anticipation.

Queen Aethelred froze for a moment, staring at me in disbelief. Once she realized I wasn't joking, she suddenly looked as though she'd been dealt a crushing blow. 

She snatched my wrist. "Come back to the palace with me!"

A flash of white, and Elysia was between us, pushing Queen Aethelred and me apart. "Are you deaf?" she snapped. "She said she wants a divorce."
