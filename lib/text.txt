I knew that when the power went out in the ICU at midnight, 200 elderly patients on ventilators would slowly suffocate to death.

But at 12:01 AM, when my daughter Emily frantically asked me what to do, I calmly played on my phone, completely unconcerned.

That's because in my previous life, as soon as the power went out, I immediately went to connect the backup power supply and checked on each elderly patient one by one.

After finishing, I passed out from exhaustion.

At some point, Emily burst in with her colleagues and forcibly dragged me up.

"Dad, isn't saving lives your sacred duty? How could you cruelly murder those elderly patients?"

That's when I learned that all the elderly patients in the ICU had suffocated to death without exception.

The police arrested me, saying I was the only one inside and my fingerprints were found on the power switch.

Emily produced a video to actively assist the investigation: "My dad often complained that the elderly patients in the ICU were troublesome and wished they would all die."

My wife Linda bitterly accused me, "You killed so many elderly people - you don't deserve to be a doctor!"

Enraged family members of the patients swarmed and beat me to death.

I died not understanding - the ventilators were working normally, so how did those elderly patients suffocate?

Why did my own daughter produce a fake video to frame me?

When I opened my eyes again, I had returned to the moment the power went out.

Chapter 1

The lights suddenly went dark, and the beeping of the monitors stopped.

"Oh no, the power's out," I blurted out.

Emily pretended to ask anxiously, "Dad, what do we do now?"

I calmly turned on my phone's flashlight and looked around.

Emily had just started her medical residency at the hospital where I worked after getting her master's degree. I had been supervising her.

In my previous life, the power also went out at this time. She told me to stay and connect the backup power while she went to report to the hospital director.

But she never came back until everything went wrong.

"Dad!" Emily stomped her foot impatiently when she saw me not reacting. "What do we do now? If all these elderly patients die, we're finished!"

She knew how serious the situation was, so why did she disappear without a trace last time?

Some of the more lucid elderly patients noticed the monitors had gone silent and started calling for help.

The patients relying on ventilators to stay alive were struggling to breathe, their faces turning red.

I felt terrible for them, but I knew they wouldn't be in immediate danger, so I continued to feign calm.

Emily was as anxious as an ant on a hot pan, yelling at me: "You're the head of the ICU, these are all your patients. Are you really going to just let them die?"

In my previous life, I would have rushed to check on the patients and sternly scolded her.

But after going through that experience, I was no longer so panicked.

I noticed that although she seemed anxious on the surface, her eyes couldn't hide her malicious intent.

I suddenly wondered - could the power outage be related to her?

I shrugged and snapped back irritably:

"How am I supposed to save them? There are nearly 200 elderly patients in the ICU. Do you expect me to push them all out one by one?"

Emily was suddenly at a loss for words, looking very displeased. She spoke even more harshly:

"So you're just going to watch them all die here? Are you even human?"

I sat down helplessly and glanced at the elderly patients.

"What can I do? It would take over three hours to get all these elderly patients out. This one might die before I can save that one. Whether one dies or a hundred die, I'm screwed either way. Might as well stay here and watch them all die. I'll take whatever punishment comes."

As I spoke, I gently stroked her face and smiled resignedly.

"At least my daughter will be by my father's side when he dies. I guess my love for you wasn't wasted after all."

Emily violently pulled her hand away and screamed at me like a madwoman:

"You're insane! You want to drag me down with you? I don't have a father like you."

With that, she ran away like crazy, looking back as if afraid I would chase after her and implicate her.

Watching her fleeing figure, my mood instantly plummeted.

I had cherished and doted on her since she was little, but now when trouble came, she abandoned me without a second thought and even said she didn't have a father like me.

More and more elderly patients were calling for help, their voices rising and falling. The situation was growing dire.

Looking at the closed door, I smiled bitterly.

For a full ten hours, not a single person came from the hospital. It was as if we had been completely abandoned.

At 10 AM the next day, family members coming to visit all gathered outside the ICU.

Seeing it pitch black inside, they instantly panicked and started shouting.

"Why are there no lights at all? Don't tell me the power's out?"

"Shit, don't scare me. My dad's 90 years old and relies entirely on a ventilator. If the power's out, what will happen to him?"

"Let's break down the door and push the elderly patients out. Maybe we can still save them."

The other family members thought this was a good idea and were about to do it.

Just as they were about to break down the door, I opened it from the inside and walked out.

"Oh, Dr. James, you're inside. Then we have nothing to worry about."

"That's right, I was just about to tell you all. Dr. James has impeccable ethics. With him there, everything will be fine."

"Dr. James, I haven't had any news about my dad for 7-8 days. How is he doing? Can I see him?"

The family members' eyes were filled with tears. The elderly patients in the ICU were all critically ill.

The only filial duty they could fulfill was the weekly visit.

Seeing their pleading eyes, I was about to speak when suddenly someone pushed through the crowd and publicly accused me.

"James, even if you're my dad, I absolutely won't be your accomplice."

"You knew that after the power went out, those 200 elderly patients could die at any moment. Yet you did nothing and watched them suffocate to death with your own eyes. You even wanted to drag me down with you!"

"You're not fit to be a doctor, let alone a father! I'm ashamed of you!"

Emily glared at me furiously, as if we had some deep, irreconcilable grudge.

She was my own daughter. With her coming forward to accuse me, the family members instantly broke down.

Several women collapsed to the ground in despair, covering their faces and wailing loudly.

Some men gritted their teeth and glared at me as if they wanted to tear me to pieces.

Others had already pushed past me to kick at the door, hoping to save their parents.

But it was a steel airtight door with a passcode lock. Only I could open it.

Before I could say anything, another person squeezed into the crowd.

It was my wife Linda.

In my previous life, if I hadn't drunk the coffee she bought me, I wouldn't have slept so deeply, and those elderly patients wouldn't have died so mysteriously.

Things were becoming clear.

Fine, since you want to frame me, I'll make sure everyone knows about it.

Chapter 2

I shrugged helplessly and said with resignation:

"Over 200 elderly patients and just one doctor - how could I save them all?"

"I can't be in multiple places at once. How could I possibly get all your parents out at the same time?"

"If I save this one, I can't save that one. Someone was bound to die. Which of you would be willing to let your own parents stay behind to die?"

In my previous life, I had wanted to say this.

Back then, I desperately went to connect the backup power supply. But each power unit weighed over 150 pounds. After finishing, I collapsed from exhaustion.

When I saw the elderly patients were all safe and sleeping peacefully, I felt it was worth all the hardship and fatigue.

But when I woke up, everyone was accusing me of causing the elderly patients to suffocate to death.

Even these family members who had just been praising my ethics believed it without a doubt.

They beat and kicked me without letting me explain, beating me to death.

Saving lives was my duty. I didn't expect gratitude from everyone. But since they all thought I was a murderer, I might as well not bother.

Before I finished speaking, the family members completely lost it.

They angrily surged towards me, their imposing manner exactly the same as when they beat me to death in my previous life.

Linda saw the moment had come and rushed up to slap me.

"James, you're the head of our ICU. You just received an award last month. How can you be so inhumane?"

"Your daughter righteously exposed the truth, but not only do you make excuses, you're here saying cold-hearted things."

"Who would be willing to let their parents die? Even if you only saved a few, at least it would show you tried your best."

"But you didn't save a single one. You're worse than an animal!"

Seeing the mother and daughter speaking in perfect unison, I sighed softly and didn't argue.

I wanted to see how they would continue to frame me.

Linda gave Emily a look.

Emily immediately took out a pre-prepared video and played it for everyone at maximum volume.

In the video, I was ranting like a madman, spewing complaints and vicious words.

"Looking at you old geezers who won't die makes me sick."

"You're all 70 or 80 years old. Why don't you just die already instead of clinging to life? You're just wasting air and resources."

"What are you looking at? Sooner or later I'm going to shut off your ventilators and let you all suffocate."

In my previous life, Emily posted this video online, causing outrage across the internet.

The family members swarmed me, punching and kicking, slapping my face, even stabbing me with knives, beating me to death.

The real culprits were this mother and daughter pair.

Coming back to my senses, I still felt pain all over my body.

At this point, Linda could no longer hide the wild joy in her eyes, but she still put on a righteous act.

"James, I've been your wife for 20 years, yet I never realized you were a wolf in sheep's clothing."

"The whole hospital has power except your unit, and it just happens to be during your shift. You're the murderer!"

Emily shook her head in disappointment.

"I don't have a father like you! You taught me to respect the elderly, but now you've killed 200 elderly patients with your own hands. You deserve to be cut into a thousand pieces."

Incited by the mother and daughter, the family members now all had bloodshot eyes, like angry beasts ready to tear me to pieces.

"Scum! I treated you like a lifesaving benefactor. Ptooey! You're not even human."

"You butcher! My mom raised me through thick and thin, and you killed her. I'll make you pay blood for blood!"

"We came from far away for you to save lives. But you killed my dad. I want your life!"

The family members who had been kicking the door now surrounded me from behind, about to attack.

At this critical moment, a stern shout froze everyone.

"Stop!"

Everyone turned to look.

Seven or eight police officers rushed in, separating the crowd.

"Someone reported that a doctor at this hospital abused his position to deliberately kill elderly patients. Who is James? Come with us."

The family members glared at me fiercely, their fingers almost jabbing my face.

"It's this butcher who killed my dad! Arrest him and execute him!"

"Why waste words on this scum? Kill him!"

"A life for a life. Kill him!"

The scene from my previous life was playing out again.

It all seemed meticulously planned in advance, with everything falling into place.

If I hadn't lived through this once before, I would surely be at a loss now and fall victim to their scheme again.

After calming myself, I looked at the police and said calmly:

"I didn't kill anyone."

"You need evidence to accuse me of murder. Otherwise it's malicious defamation, and I will pursue legal action!"

Linda laughed coldly and immediately smiled ingratiatingly at the police.

"Officer, I'm the one who called the police. I'm also his wife Linda and a doctor at this hospital."

"I have ironclad evidence that can prove James killed 200 elderly patients!"

Hearing this, the police officers instantly became highly alert.

"200 elderly patients? This is no joke. Can you take responsibility for what you're saying?"

Linda patted her chest and said, "The ICU has always had an independent power supply. Even if the whole hospital lost power, it shouldn't be possible here. But last night the power was out for 10 hours. It must have been deliberate. Also, I can guarantee with 100% certainty that James' fingerprints will be on the power switch!"

Seeing her speak so confidently, the gathered family members became even more enraged and tried to rush forward to hit me.

If not for the police officers desperately holding them back, I would have been beaten to death already.

Instead of retreating, I stepped forward and shouted:

"If you kill me, you'll never know who really murdered your parents."

Linda and Emily exchanged a glance, both looking a bit guilty, before continuing to shout defiantly.

"The evidence is irrefutable. Are you still trying to deny it?"

"James, I advise you to confess quickly, or it will only get worse for you!"

"Officer, don't believe my dad's lies. Every time he does something wrong he refuses to admit it. Take him away quickly."

Some family members who had hesitated after hearing my words now all prostrated themselves, weeping bitterly.

"Mom, your son is unfilial. I entrusted you to this heartless beast for treatment, causing you to die tragically."

"Officer, my dad had late-stage cancer. His last wish was to see his family again. Now it's all been ruined by this animal."

"A life for a life. He killed 200 elderly people. We'll give him 200 stab wounds, not one less!"

Looking at the over 100 wailing family members, the police officer angrily grabbed my arm.

"So many people are accusing you of being the murderer."

"James, please come with us to cooperate with our investigation and clear things up."

Seeing him take out handcuffs, I calmly blocked his hand.

"I didn't kill anyone. You have no right to arrest me!"

Turning around, I entered the passcode on the lock.

Beep. The steel door slowly opened.

At this moment, I felt incredibly relieved. It was finally time for me to fight back.

Chapter 3

All the elderly patients were lying in their beds, breathing rhythmically, completely unharmed.

The lucid patients even turned their heads to look at me, their eyes full of kindness and gratitude.

Seeing this, my eyes instantly welled up with tears.

Sometimes I really don't need them to thank me verbally or give me honorary banners.

Just one grateful look makes me feel that all my efforts were worthwhile.

At this moment, a 90-year-old patient reached out his hand, gesturing for me to come over.

After a period of treatment, his condition had clearly improved and he could speak clearly and forcefully.

"Dr. James, you've worked so hard these past days."

"If you hadn't saved me in time last night, I surely would have died. Thank you, thank you so much."

The family members who had been cursing me just moments ago were now all struck dumb.

They stood rooted to the spot, completely motionless.

When they came to their senses, they rushed in to find their parents, eyes brimming with tears, overcome with emotion.

"Mom, are you alright?"

"Dad, I thought I'd never see you again."

After confirming their parents were alive, many family members knelt down and kowtowed to me.

"Dr. James, I'm so sorry for wrongly accusing you."

Others slapped themselves and pounded the ground in remorse.

"I'm not human."

"Dr. James, you worked so hard to save my mom, but I believed others' false accusations and was convinced you killed her. I even shouted about killing you. I'm the one who's worse than an animal!"

Seeing so many people apologizing and begging forgiveness, I quickly told them to get up.

Although they beat me to death in my previous life, it was because they had seen their parents actually dead and lashed out in extreme grief.

Ultimately, it was Linda and Emily's fault. They were the true culprits.

The police officer who had been about to handcuff me now understood the truth and took the initiative to apologize.

"Dr. James, we didn't investigate thoroughly and almost caused a terrible mistake. We wronged you."

"I sincerely apologize to you. I'm so sorry."

I immediately helped them up, smiling.

"It's alright. It was just a misunderstanding. Now that it's cleared up, everything's fine."

"Since the elderly patients are all okay, we'll be leaving now."

I quickly reached out to stop them, glancing at Linda and Emily.

"Officer, now that you can prove I didn't kill those 200 elderly patients, how should we deal with the people who maliciously slandered me and even produced fake evidence?"

The police officer followed my gaze to the mother and daughter pair.

He immediately went over to question them: "You insisted when you called that Dr. James killed 200 elderly patients. You even incited these family members to nearly cause him bodily harm."

"How do you explain yourself now?"

Linda was startled, her face changing dramatically. She unconsciously took a step back.

I had thought she would immediately admit her mistake and beg forgiveness, but I didn't expect her to continue spewing vicious lies.

"Officer, don't believe his nonsense!"

The police officer snorted angrily and pointed at Linda, berating her:

"You're still slandering Dr. James as talking nonsense? The elderly patients are all fine now. Who's really talking nonsense?"

"Also, didn't you say you had evidence proving Dr. James was the murderer? Where's the evidence?"

"If you can't produce it, I won't let you escape legal punishment!"
