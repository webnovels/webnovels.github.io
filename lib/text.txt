 After I became a double, I took out all the rich families.

In my past life, I died in international waters. 

It was only after my death that I realized I wasn't the elite family's son who was switched at birth. I was just a stand-in to take the fall for the real son. 

My childhood friend, who climbed her way into the elite family by stepping over me, knew everything all along. She cozied up to the real son, smiling sweetly: "Asher's life is worthless; dying for you is his blessing!"

I mistakenly believed that my biological parents, who betrayed me, would seek justice for me, but they were brutally silenced. 

When I woke up again, my childhood friend excitedly grabbed me: "Asher, you're going to be the elite family's young master!"

Fate gave me another chance to return to my past life. This time, I'm taking down that damned elite family.

When the fake parents from the elite family came looking for me, I was still in class. Adeline brought them from home, looking thrilled: "Asher, you're going to be the elite family's young master!"

Looking at her innocent face, I was momentarily dazed. Adeline and I were neighbors, and we grew up together. 

Her parents died in an accident when she was five. Her relatives treated her as a burden, passing her around. My parents pitied her and cared for her more than they did for me, their biological son. They always reminded me to protect Adeline and not let anyone bully her. 

Whenever that happened, Adeline would blush and remain silent. She told me as a child that she only wanted to marry me. I thought we were in love.

So, I begged my fake parents to bring Adeline along, or I wouldn't go with them. But as soon as we arrived at The Quinn Family, she ran into the real son Declan's arms. 

Under Declan's instigation, she knew I was just his stand-in but didn't tell me the truth. Instead, she helped Declan trap me. 

In the end, I took the knife for Declan and was blown up by The Quinn Family's enemies in international waters, with no remains left. 

Fighting back my overwhelming hatred, I closed my eyes, resisting the urge to confront her right there. Instead, I walked toward the luxury car parked at the door. Adeline hurriedly stopped me.

"Asher! Are you leaving? Aren't you forgetting something?" 

Seeing the expectation and anxiety in her eyes, I understood. Adeline had also been reborn.

I gave a cold smile and pretended not to know: "Yeah, is there something you want?"

My indifferent tone left Adeline at a loss. She bit her lip hard, tears welling up in her eyes, looking pitiful: "Asher, can you take me with you..."

I watched her playfully without speaking. Every second that passed, Adeline's face turned a shade paler. 

After enjoying her embarrassment and shame, I stretched lazily: "Adeline, I'm now the elite family's young master. With your status... bringing you along wouldn't be appropriate, right?"

Adeline's face turned red and then white. I changed my tone: "However, if you really want to come back to The Quinn Family with me, it's not impossible." 

Her eyes lit up as if she saw hope. Greed and joy almost overflowed from her eyes. She obediently tugged at my sleeve: "Asher, I'll do whatever you say! I'll be good."

A hint of disgust flashed in my eyes as I pulled my sleeve away: "Fine, The Quinn Family shouldn't mind having one more servant. I'll talk to the butler to find you some cleaning work."

Adeline's smile froze, and she looked at me in shock. 

In the previous life, I willingly cherished her, took her to The Quinn Family, and treated her like a treasure, afraid others would bully her. 

Now, she wants to enter The Quinn Family, but she can only be a cleaning servant. The difference is like night and day. How could Adeline bear this disparity?

I didn't look at her again and turned to leave. 

She stopped me: "Wait!... I'll go!"

I was a bit surprised. After shock and embarrassment, Adeline still bit her lip and followed. 

To enter the elite family, she really was enduring humiliation. 

I forced a smile: "Adeline, are you sure you want to come to The Quinn Family?"

Adeline had already controlled her expression, obediently and aggrievedly "hmm"ed. 

But the resentment in her eyes didn't escape my notice. I chuckled coldly inside. 

Since she wants to dig her own grave, she can't blame anyone else.

The Quinn Family is a true elite family, living on an estate with over a hundred servants. 

Adeline and I were welcomed inside, and the fake parents and Declan were already waiting.

The Quinns put on an impressive show, shedding tears and showing concern upon seeing me. 

They also mentioned they would soon send Declan abroad, telling me not to worry. 

Ha, of course, only after I die. 

Before I could say anything, Adeline, who had been staring at Declan since entering, suddenly spoke up. 

Her voice was soft, and her face slightly red: "Uncle, Auntie, Asher has been kind and filial since childhood. He definitely wouldn't want you to be separated from Declan."

The fake parents were stunned and asked who she was. Declan also turned to look at Adeline. 

I spoke disdainfully: "Oh, she's a neighbor of mine, eager to come to The Quinn Family as a servant. Dad, Mom, let the butler arrange some work for her."

Adeline's face turned pale, almost twisted. 

The Quinns exchanged a glance, showing some disdain. 

Declan's gaze turned blatant. In his eyes, Adeline was nothing but someone willing to degrade herself to cling to the powerful. 

In the previous life, it was because of how much I valued and cared for Adeline that The Quinn Family considered her important. 

She was just a tool to control and manipulate me. 

Without my favor, The Quinn Family wouldn't even look at her. 

Now seeing me disdain her and her desperate eagerness to stick around... Declan isn't stupid, and The Quinns are even shrewder. Would they treat her kindly?

Adeline clearly didn't grasp the situation and still saw herself as the pampered lady. 

On her first day, she started causing trouble. The butler cautiously observed my reaction: "Young Master Asher, Miss Adeline said you know she can't live with others and wants us to arrange a single room for her. According to the rules, regular servants can only stay in four-person rooms, but since Miss Adeline is someone you brought, as long as you say..."

"Ignore her," I said lightly. "She loves being difficult. Arrange her as you would any servant. If she doesn't want to stay, let her leave."

Since childhood, my parents and I have pampered Adeline. 

When she first stayed in a school dormitory, she cried and fussed to go home, saying she couldn't get along with her roommates. 

She cried so prettily, and my parents and I were heartbroken. 

Her vocational high school was far from home, and my comprehensive high school had heavy coursework, but I still got up an hour early every day to take her to school and picked her up at night. 

Through scorching summers and freezing winters, I never complained. 

Thinking of this, I called the butler again: "Also, give her the dirtiest and most tiring work. If it's not done, she doesn't eat."

I let my disgust show. The butler, a shrewd old fox, naturally knew how to "take care" of Adeline.

That day, as I was about to leave, I saw Adeline ordering another maid to scrub the tiles. 

"Mrs. Lee, make sure it's clean, here, and there. Didn't I say it needs to be scrubbed three times with clean water? Finish before lunch, and be quick!"

A younger girl couldn't stand it: "Sister Adeline, this is your job. Why are you ordering Mrs. Lee?"

Adeline stood up from the lounge chair and slapped the young girl. 

"Lowly servant, do you think you have the right to speak?! If I want your young master to go east, he wouldn't dare go west. And you, a servant, dare to show me attitude? Fine, I'll tell Asher, and you'll pack your things and leave!"

The young girl's cheek swelled instantly, tears streaming down. 

Mrs. Lee tenderly touched the girl's cheek, angry but not daring to speak out. 

Adeline was still smug: "I'm someone Asher cherishes. If I get hurt doing such rough work, and he gets heartbroken and angry, none of you will have it easy!"

I watched coldly as she acted like the mistress, flaunting her power, and called the butler. 

Hearing my voice, Adeline quickly changed her expression, showing her red fingers pitifully. 

"Asher, they're bullying me! They're deliberately giving me the dirtiest and most tiring work! Look, my hands are red from the cold!"

She habitually whined to me, hinting for me to punish others for her. 

Mrs. Lee and the young maid were visibly fearful. 

I ignored Adeline and frowned at the butler: "Adeline is slacking off and bullying other servants. She won't eat today, and from now on, let her do the work for both of them. Also, no hot water for her."

Adeline was right in front of me, but I didn't speak directly to her, nor did I even look at her. Instead, I issued her "punishment" through the butler, a blatant slap in the face. 

Her face turned various shades of pale, unable to maintain her weak and innocent act, and she burst out: "Asher, what do you mean?! How dare you order me around? Do you really think you're the young master?"

I glanced at her: "Talking back to the young master, slap her."

She was stunned. 

No one else reacted either. 

I signaled the young maid Adeline had slapped to come over. 

The girl was quick-witted, tears still on her face, and she slapped back hard. 

Adeline clutched her face, disbelief and humiliation overflowing, screaming: "Asher! Are you crazy?! How dare you let someone hit me!"

I chuckled: "Because I'm now the young master of The Quinn Family, and you're just a servant. Do I need to pick a day to hit you?"

"Adeline, you begged me to bring you to The Quinn Family, remember?"

Her lips trembled, unable to endure the humiliating and mocking gazes, and she ran off crying.

I thought Adeline would lay low for a few days. 

But I overestimated her.
The little girl was sharp; despite tears on her face, she had already retaliated fiercely.

Adeline held her face, disbelief and humiliation pouring out as she screamed:  
"Asher! Are you insane?! How dare you have someone hit me!"

I laughed softly:  
"Because I'm now the young master of The Quinn Family, and you're just a servant. If I want to hit you, I hit you. Why would I wait for a special occasion?"

"Adeline, you begged me to bring you to The Quinn Family, have you forgotten?"  
Her lips trembled, and unable to bear the humiliation and mocking gazes from everyone, she ran off crying.

I thought Adeline would lay low for a few days.  
But I overestimated her.

After just a few days of work, she couldn't handle it anymore and found a way to get into Declan's bed.  
In our previous life, she and Declan were like two peas in a pod and naturally hooked up.  
When I noticed she was skipping classes too much, I naively advised her to focus on her studies.

Adeline had already latched onto Declan and didn't even bother to pretend:  
"Asher, did you get into the elite family by studying hard? I'm not as fortunate as you. If I want a good life, I have to work hard in my own way."

Later, I understood.  
Her way was to latch onto an elite family and become a rich woman.  
As for why she didn't choose me, Declan once asked her.

At that time, she was in the kitchen having an animated conversation with Declan, and I happened to come downstairs for a drink of water, hearing her say sweetly:  
"I’m not blind. Anyone can see, Declan, you're the real catch. Asher, even if he rises above his humble beginnings, is still just a poor phoenix at heart. How can he compare to your natural elegance?"

She wasn't wrong. Declan was indeed a true rich kid.  
But his elegance was built on the exploitation of countless ordinary people.  
Why would Declan be interested in someone as ordinary and poor as her?

In the past life, Declan would even take her to high-end places for my sake, buy her designer bags, brands, jewelry, to appease her.  
Now she was just a lowly maid with some charm, and he had nothing to lose by playing around.

Adeline climbed into bed at night and worked during the day.  
Once the other servants in The Quinn Family knew what she was, they shunned her mercilessly.  
Adeline, pampered and spoiled, fell ill after just a few days of this.

Declan moved her into his room.  
Not out of pity, but because his troublesome friends were coming.

6  
That day, Declan invited me to a private club to introduce me to his friends.  
The club was invitation-only, accessible only to VIPs.  
In the past life, he also invited Adeline and me, greatly satisfying her vanity.  
But I refused to let Adeline go, no matter what.

Because I overheard Declan planning to entertain his troublesome friends.  
He was ready to use her as entertainment.

On the phone, Declan's tone was dismissive:  
"Someone like Adeline, you guys can do as you please with her."

I told her Declan was a wolf in sheep's clothing.  
But Adeline didn't believe me.

Seeing us argue fiercely, Declan played the good guy instead:  
"Asher is just worried about you. Since he disagrees, Adeline, you better not go."

Adeline then completely broke with me:  
"Asher, who are you to control me? I only received a little care from your family, it's not like I was sold to you as a child bride! I warn you, my business with Declan is none of your concern, so stop meddling!"

So this time when Declan mentioned taking Adeline along, I wasn't surprised and didn't stop him.  
Adeline was taken aback for a moment, then a smug look quickly crossed her face as she anticipated a show.  
She remembered Declan intended to set a trap for me.  
But she didn't know, Declan's trap was not just for me.

At this moment, Officer Sawyer secretly contacted me.

In the past life, I had some suspicions that The Quinn Family's business wasn't clean, and their money's origin was unclear.  
The police had been watching The Quinn Family for a long time, but without solid evidence, they were afraid to alert them.  
At that time, Officer Sawyer tried to persuade me to cooperate with them to take down The Quinn Group's illegal business operations.  
But I was too bewitched by Adeline and The Quinn Family, my mind wasn't clear.

By the time I realized, it was too late.  
So when Sawyer contacted me, I cooperated calmly, almost making her suspect I was a double agent.
It looks like the text you intended to provide is missing. Could you please share the content that needs translation?

I already know the truth about The Quinn Family using me as a stand-in for Declan.

Nora Sawyer had to conduct several investigations before she could trust me completely. After handing me a mini camera and a bug, she hesitated:
