---

At the centennial banquet of Perry Corporation, I accidentally wore a bracelet belonging to Declan Perry's ex-wife. 

Seven-year-old Asher Perry pushed me down the stairs in front of everyone and splashed champagne all over me. He stood above me on the steps, his gaze cold and disdainful, just like his father's.

"Who do you think you are, wearing my mom's bracelet?"

"Don't think you can replace her by trying to win me over! When I grow up, I'll make sure you get kicked out of the Perry Family!"

The evening breeze blew softly, extinguishing the last warmth in my heart. Looking at this child I had raised since birth, I suddenly understood.

Awkwardly, I got up, meeting his gaze with calmness. "You don't have to wait until you grow up. I'll leave tomorrow."

I limped up the stairs, ignoring the curious stares, intending to change my clothes. But Asher suddenly charged at me, raising his hand to slap me.

Instinctively, I blocked him, my wrist hitting the railing. The bracelet shattered with a sharp sound.

"This was my mom's favorite bracelet! How dare you break it, you wicked woman!"

Asher's eyes turned red with anger and hatred. I remained silent for a long moment before sighing softly. 

"Asher Perry, you're lying."

This bracelet was a gift from Grandmother for my wedding. He froze for a moment but quickly resumed his arrogant demeanor.

"So what? If I say you can't wear it, then you won't!"

He sneered and ran off. I didn't chase after him to explain as I usually would.

When the banquet ended and I returned to the Perry Family's old house, the housekeeper looked like she wanted to say something but held back. I rushed to the bedroom and from afar could smell the strong scent of blood.

Opening the door, I saw my little dog lying in a pool of blood on the bed, and my photos were slashed to pieces on the floor. Seeing my face full of sorrow, Asher burst into laughter.

"This is your punishment for offending me!"

He stomped on my photos, shaking his head triumphantly. "Seeing you so upset makes me really happy!"

He stuck his tongue out at me and ran off, laughing. I couldn't understand why such a young child would harbor so much hatred against me.

After Grandmother passed away, besides the bracelet she left me, only this little dog kept me company. It stayed by my side through countless sleepless nights and helped me raise Asher from a crying baby to a young boy.

But that night, I lost everything.

When Declan Perry returned, I was still sitting on the floor in a daze. The sound of leather shoes approaching made me look up. He looked down at me, his eyes filled with the same disdain and indifference as Asher's.

He didn't even glance at the chaos in the room but frowned and reprimanded me in a deep voice. "Nora Taylor, today was your fault."

Seeing that I didn't get up or respond, he grew impatient. "Asher is only seven years old; he's still a child. Why are you arguing with him?"

That simple word "child" seemed to excuse everything. But what about my little dog? How innocent it was.

Seeing my unpleasant expression, he softened his tone for once. "In a few days, I'll have the secretary get you another one."

Then he waved dismissively, and the housekeeper put my little dog into a trash bag. Soon, all traces of blood and broken glass were cleaned up, as if my little dog had never existed.

Just like me, who had meticulously cared for him and Asher for seven years, it was as if nothing had ever happened.

After washing up, Declan sat at the head of the bed and handed me the hairdryer, signaling me to dry his hair. Instinctively, I searched for an outlet but was unexpectedly pulled into his embrace.

"In three days, accompany me to the Perry Family's new perfume launch."

Every Perry Family perfume is crafted by Declan in memory of his sister. So every year, he uses our unmarried status as an excuse to bar me from attending, even if the whole internet mocks me as his mistress. He doesn't care.

His damp hair soaked my clothes, chilling me to the core. I've been married to Declan Perry for seven years and have been pregnant with his child. But when he found out, his first reaction wasn't joy; he sought the best doctor to remove my fallopian tubes.

"I'll only have Summer Taylor as my wife in this lifetime, and only one child."

"Your responsibility is to raise Asher, so don't think about anything else."

Declan's usual tactic was to give a slap and then a sweet treat. But for the first time, I refused him when I should have been overjoyed.

"Mr. Perry, the seven-year agreement is up. I should leave tomorrow."

Chapter 2

Declan's hand around my waist froze, his gaze cold. "How long are you going to keep this up?"

"Asher is just a child! Besides, you're his mom. Isn't it your fault for not educating him well? I haven't even blamed you, yet you're causing a scene!"

Mom? I looked at him indifferently. When did Declan and his son ever consider me a wife and mom?

Back then, Declan Perry, the Prince of the Beijing Circle, fell in love with my sister at first sight and insisted on marrying her. But the elders of the Perry Family disagreed, so he eloped abroad with my sister in a fit of anger.

The two of them lived in blissful happiness. But since Perry Corporation only had one heir, Declan had to return to inherit the family business. On their way back home, they got into a car accident. My pregnant sister died from hemorrhaging during labor, leaving only the premature son.

The family couldn't afford to lose Declan, their cash cow, so I was asked to take care of my little nephew in the Perry Family. But Declan was unwilling to marry me. Even though I took on the title of Mrs. Perry and played the role of Asher's mom for seven years, we never registered our marriage.

The world called me his mistress, and it wasn't without reason. I pursed my lips. "Mr. Perry, you promised that when Asher reached school age, you'd let me go."

"After all, I'm not really your wife. Staying here in the Perry Family isn't good for your reputation."

Hearing my words, Declan's cold expression softened a bit. The way he looked at me was almost gentle.

"If you attend the launch event with me, who would dare gossip?"

"As for the rest, it's not that I won't..."

"No need." I interrupted his unfinished words.

In the first half of my life, I was cursed as an unwanted child. I don't want to spend the latter half being called a mistress.

"Asher is ready for school. I've already found him an international school. I'm really not cut out for raising kids."

"As for everything at the Perry Family's old house, the housekeeper can handle it without me."

Declan pinched my waist and threw me onto the bed. He looked down at me, all gentleness gone, his voice as cold as ice.

"Nora Taylor, who do you think you are!"

"This Perry Family isn't a place you can come and go as you please!"

"You're attending the launch with me in three days. You have no choice."

With a bang, the door slammed shut, shaking the walls. The painting on the wall fell and shattered into pieces.

Looking at the fragments on the floor, I bit my lip and couldn't help but cry. That painting was done by Declan for me. But the person in the painting wasn't me; it was my sister.

The day before I went to the Perry Family to take care of Asher, Mrs. Taylor warned me.

"If it weren't for my daughter's misfortune and you looking like her, you shameless woman wouldn't stand a chance!"

"When you get to the Perry Family, you'd better behave and take good care of my grandson, or don't blame me for being harsh!"

She wasn't wrong. I've been by Declan's side for seven years. If it weren't for my resemblance to my sister, he wouldn't have painted me during his free time.

Those were the rare moments of warmth I could remember. From childhood to now, only when Declan painted me did I feel a hint of warmth.

But seven years made me realize it was all fake.

The door was kicked open. Asher Perry stormed in angrily, holding the custom gown Declan had prepared for me. His eyes were red as he glared at me with hatred.

"You wicked woman, you really want to replace my mom!"

"Dream on about attending the launch!"

He cursed as he cut the gown into shreds with scissors. Only when the gown was completely ruined did he feel pleased and stomped on it several times.

Worried he might hurt himself with the scissors, I tried to snatch them from him but was met with a swipe that left a long cut on my arm, soaking my clothes with blood.

His eyes showed panic, but he still defiantly said, "As long as you're leeching off my family, I won't let you have peace!"

Holding my bleeding arm, I felt utterly defeated. Seven years of close care only brought resentment and neglect from this father and son.

Chapter 3

"Don't hurt yourself. Get some rest."

I reminded him one last time, turning to close the door. I packed my things but couldn't leave because of Mrs. Taylor's arrival.

Dressed head to toe in luxury, she was adorned with jewelry. Seeing the suitcase in my hand, she softened her tone for the first time. "Nora, after all, Asher is your nephew. Are you really going to let him be all alone?"

"Besides, staying in the Perry Family is for our good too! If Declan marries and has more children, we might end up empty-handed!"

It all boiled down to not wanting to lose the villa and BMW Declan provided, afraid of losing the luxury and wealth.

With a calm smile, the voices of two people approaching interrupted what I was about to say.

"Aunt Luna, I've missed you!"

Asher Perry clung to Luna Foster's hand, acting all cutesy.

Luna Foster smiled as she picked him up, affectionately rubbing her cheek against his. "Really? Then why didn't you come find me?"
"Anyway, staying with the Perry Family is for our own benefit! Otherwise, if Declan Perry marries and has children in the future, we might end up with nothing!"

At the core, it's all about clinging to the villa and BMW that Declan Perry provided, fearing the loss of such luxuries.

I managed a faint smile, but my thoughts were interrupted by the cheerful voices of two people approaching.

"Aunt Luna, I've missed you!" exclaimed Asher Perry, holding onto Luna Foster's hand and acting playfully.

Luna Foster chuckled as she picked him up, affectionately rubbing her cheek against his.

"Really? Then why haven't you come to see me?" she teased.

Asher Perry rolled his eyes at me before hugging Luna Foster's neck. "If I keep visiting you, Dad will get upset!"

"Besides, if I go to you, who's going to help me deal with the bad woman? I embarrassed her yesterday!"

Watching Asher Perry's triumphant grin made my heart ache.

When he was three, he had a persistent high fever, and I stayed with him in the hospital room for three sleepless nights.

Later, I tried to make him some porridge but fainted in the kitchen.

Sparks ignited the curtains, nearly engulfing me in flames.

Thankfully, he was worried about me and came looking for me. Seeing the fire in the kitchen, he cried and drew the attention of the security guards.

Afterwards, he clung to my neck, sobbing, "Auntie, I can't be without you!"

Who could have known then?

The nephew who once cried and called me Auntie would later wound me deeply with his actions.

This seemingly gentle woman greeted me with a smile, but her words were full of provocation.

"Miss Taylor, please don't be upset; Asher is still young."

It's absurd.

The child I've cared for so attentively listens to others without question.

Once they left, I turned to Mrs. Taylor.

"You see, Asher isn't short of people to look after him."

Luna Foster was originally just a waitress, but with a face that resembles my sister's by seventy percent, she easily won over both father and son.

Declan Perry handed her an entire perfume production line, holding her hand tightly both in public and private, as if they were family.

Mrs. Taylor glared at me coldly. "Are you really planning to leave?"

I replied firmly, "I don't have many more seven-year periods to waste..."

Before I could finish, she slapped me.

"In the end, you're just the daughter of a shameless mistress, a bastard through and through!"

"If it weren't for me pitying you and raising you, you'd have died out there already!"

Back then, my father pretended to be a wealthy bachelor, deceiving my mother who had just arrived from the countryside.

After my mom got pregnant with me, she found out he was already married.

Mrs. Taylor cornered her at school, humiliating her, making it known to the world that she was a mistress seducing a married man.

Heartbroken, she gave birth to me in a rented room and then jumped to her death.

If I weren't indeed the Taylor family's daughter, they would have discarded me, which would have been illegal. What chance did I have?

When the second slap was about to fall, I blocked Mrs. Taylor's hand.

"For thirty years, I've given everything to the Taylor family."

"I owe you nothing."

I endured endless humiliation and abuse at the Taylor family, being beaten and scolded whenever Mrs. Taylor was unhappy. I grew up without ever attending a day of school until I was eighteen.

For the past seven years at the Perry Family, I was merely an outlet for Declan Perry.

I devoted myself to taking care of Asher Perry, giving him everything I could.

But what did I get in return?

My grandmother's jade bracelet was smashed, my puppy died, and Declan Perry cut off my fallopian tubes, ending my chance of motherhood.

I've done my utmost and owe nothing to anyone.

The only one I'm sorry to is myself.

Mrs. Taylor stormed off in anger. I turned around, meeting Declan Perry's complex gaze.

Chapter 4

He beckoned me over as if he were calling a disobedient dog.

I remained still.

Declan Perry's face immediately showed impatience.

"Nora Taylor, you're smart. You should realize that leaving the Perry Family means you have nowhere to go."

"I've asked the secretary to buy you a dog with purer bloodlines and a more expensive bracelet."

"If you find Asher hard to manage, Luna can help you; she'll start living with you at the Perry Family from today."

Declan Perry watched me, seemingly waiting for me to accept joyfully, gratefully comply, and then take care of him and his son with Luna Foster.

But I didn't want that anymore.

"You decide, it has nothing to do with me anymore."

Luna Foster stepped out from behind Declan Perry.

"I know Miss Taylor doesn't welcome me, so I should leave."

"After all, someone like me without a status doesn't deserve to take care of Asher."

She pretended to cry, walking towards the door, but was stopped by Declan Perry after just a few steps.

"Status is just a matter of my decision. If you can get pregnant, I'll make you the real Mrs. Perry."

After casting me a glance, he picked Luna Foster up in his arms.

The villa door was kicked shut by him, and the maids and butler scurried away.

Asher Perry looked at me smugly.

"Aunt Luna is kind and gentle; only she deserves to be my mom."

Looking at this child I raised from a young age, I was shocked.

"Is that really what you think?"

"Yes! You evil woman, don't think I don't know. It was you who seduced my dad, causing my mom's death from difficult childbirth!"

"Sooner or later, I'll avenge my mom!"

I looked at the amulet on his chest and sighed.

Asher Perry was a premature baby, weak and often sick.

To ensure his healthy growth, I personally took care of his every need.

I even gave him the amulet my mom left me.

Seven years of countless days and nights of care and companionship couldn't compare to a few words from outsiders.

I reached for the amulet around Asher Perry's neck.

He instinctively raised his hand to block, "If you dare hit me, I'll have Dad kick you out!"

But I only took off the amulet from his neck.

"Asher Perry, you're already seven. Even if you don't understand some things now, you will in the future."

"I didn't raise you well; someone better will take care of you. As for us, we probably won't see each other again in this lifetime."

With Asher Perry looking at me in confusion, I headed to the airport with my luggage.

The Perry Family's old residence quickly faded, disappearing from my sight.

I knew that after I left, Declan Perry would bring in someone new to care for Asher Perry.

But none of that mattered to me anymore.

Having wasted thirty years, it's time I lived for myself.

Just as I was about to board the plane, a large hand reached from behind, snatching the ticket from my hand.

The cold, indifferent voice made me shudder.

"Nora Taylor, where do you think you're going?"

Chapter 5

I turned to meet Declan Perry's angry eyes. His cold, stern demeanor was as unyielding as ever, emanating an icy aura that kept everyone at a distance. I noticed a few red kiss marks on his neck.
