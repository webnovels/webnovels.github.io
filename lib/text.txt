Grandma, a billionaire, was on the brink of death, so I donated a kidney to save her. But once she recovered, she humiliated me by throwing me into a pile of garbage. When Grandpa arrived, they were laughing and forcing me to eat trash from the street.

Jasper coldly blocked Grandpa, saying, "He's just a lowly beggar, not worth your time."

Grandpa slapped him, "Who do you think you are? Just a toy my grandson picked up, and you dare lay a hand on him?"

The guests were shocked, exclaiming, "Oh my God! He's the true heir of the Mason Family!"

In my past life, I endured everything to please Sister and Grandma, but they ended up pushing me into the water, drowning me.

Reborn, I stormed into the birthday banquet and kicked him down. "A beggar picked up from the trash dares to impersonate a noble Young Master?"

The crowd was taken aback.

Sister, in her high heels, shielded Jasper. "Declan, have you lost your mind? How dare you cause a scene in the Mason Family!"

My fiancée knelt by Jasper, tenderly massaging his wrist with pity in her eyes.

Sister immediately ordered the Bodyguards, "Are you all blind? Letting a beggar bully the Young Master!"

A dozen Bodyguards swarmed, beating me mercilessly.

Grandma swung her Cane at me relentlessly. I clutched my stomach in agony. Though the wound from donating my kidney had healed, the pain was still unbearable.

I couldn't believe that the Grandma I saved now wanted to beat me senseless for a beggar.

"Dare to touch my precious grandson, and I'll make you pay!" she shouted.

Jasper pretended to hold Grandma back, "Grandma, don't get so upset, it's not good for your health!"

Sister pointed at me, "Even a dog knows loyalty. How have we wronged you that you ruin Jasper's birthday party?"

"A filthy beggar who doesn't know his place!"

"The true Young Master of the Mason Family is clearly me, Declan..."

Smack! Sister slapped me before I could finish.

Jasper lowered his head, feigning innocence, "I know you want the Mason Family's wealth, but you shouldn't go against Grandma and Sister!"

"We've raised you for so many years, we've fulfilled our duty. How can you treat them like this?"

With Jasper's restrained demeanor, the guests began to defend him.

"How could you! Eating someone's food and then attacking their Young Master!"

"Truly despicable, a stinking beggar causing trouble in the Mason Family. The Young Master is too kind. Otherwise, throw him into the Hudson River!"

No sooner had these words been spoken than a security guard approached to snatch the Jade Bracelet from my hand. I kicked him hard, sending him flying, and he lay on the ground wailing.

Jasper quickly helped him up, glaring at me, "You, an imposter, are more arrogant than me, the Young Master, striking in public!"

Hearing this, more people began to blame me.

I laughed in disbelief, "You're the Young Master? Then who am I?"

Jasper shook his head helplessly, looking at Sister pitifully, "If he wants it, just give it to him."

Sister erupted in anger, "This is the Heirloom from Grandmother, how can it be given to a beggar! It’s meant for my real brother!"

Chapter 2

Real brother, she said it so self-righteously.

She used to be the Sister who loved me the most. Even if I lost a strand of hair, she'd fire all the maids at home, wanting to give me the best of everything.

Why did things change when Jasper came?

A beggar picked up from a garbage dump, is he worth the Mason Family's care?

They gave him my identity, my fiancée, and in the end, even drowned me to make him the Mason Family's heir.

This time, I won't make the same mistakes.

"This is clearly something Grandmother left for me! How did it become Jasper's because of your words?"

"Aren't you afraid Grandpa will blame you when he comes?"

Grandpa had planned to retire abroad but couldn't rest easy about me. He intended to officially hand over the Mason Family to me on my birthday.

Once they found out, they tried to transfer all my shares to Jasper, leaving Grandpa unable to help me.

Jasper's Rowdy Friends were the first to defend him, "A beggar picked up and really thinks he's the Young Master?"

"This was always Jasper's, who can say otherwise?"

Jasper smiled proudly, "You should have told me what you wanted, instead of behaving so disgracefully. You don’t care, but the Mason Family does."

Sister quickly said, "Almost let a bad apple spoil the whole pot."

"Ignore him, today is the day the Mason Family announces the heir. Bring the share transfer documents."

In the next moment, a few Bodyguards grabbed my arms and dragged me aside.

They're actually going to give the Mason Family to Jasper, it's insane!

"That's what Grandpa left for me!"

"If you do this, just wait to be kicked out by Grandpa!"

Sister hesitated for a moment, then signed her name heavily.

"Grandpa said the Mason Family's assets are for the Young Master, and Jasper is the Young Master!"

Grandma banged the Cane loudly, "An ungrateful wretch, dreaming of the Mason Family's wealth, not even worth a glance."

Jasper stood proudly behind Grandma, glaring at me, "Declan, stop making a fuss, or you’ll gain nothing but be kicked out of the Mason Family."

"Grandma, just consider it as if the Mason Family raised a dog. Toss it away if you must."

A dog raised by the Mason Family, that would donate a kidney for Grandma, what a joke.

If I hadn't saved her, she'd have met her end.

The Business Elite present couldn't stand it and spoke up.

"See! A great kindness is like a great enemy! Never raise an ungrateful wretch."

"In the end, it's all for money, making a scene, a stinking beggar, so shallow."

Grandma pointed her Cane and commanded, "You ruined my grandson's birthday party. Kneel and kowtow to him three times, and we’ll let you go!"

Jasper added fuel to the fire, "It's okay Grandma, I can bear it."

Sister couldn't stand Jasper being wronged, so she ordered the Bodyguards to press down on my shoulders, forcing me to kneel before Jasper.

At this moment, Fiancée Sabrina walked to Jasper, intimately holding his arm, "You're just too kind. What's a few kowtows for such an ungrateful person?"

"If you ask me, they should break his hands and feet!"

Chapter 3

I coldly watched this heartless woman and couldn't help but scoff.

I wondered who chased after me, clinging to me, caring for me, even declaring publicly they'd marry no one but me.

If Grandpa hadn't seen her genuine affection, he wouldn't have chosen such a small-time fiancée for me.

Now she’s helping them frame me.

The way she looks at Jasper, so tenderly, it makes me nauseous.

"You can't even tell who your fiancée is. You're truly hopeless!"

Seeing my imposing manner and confident words, the crowd began to doubt.

"Looking at his appearance and demeanor, he doesn't seem like a beggar."

"And to cause such a scene at a birthday party, maybe he really has evidence, could he be the Mason Family's true Young Master?"

"He does look like the Young Master, whereas Jasper... it's hard to say."

Hearing the crowd's murmur, Jasper's face turned green.

Sister immediately took Jasper's hand and went on stage.

"The Mason Family has only this one Young Master, any others are imposters!"

"Today, not only are we handing the Mason Family to Jasper, but we’ll also arrange his marriage, to stop such nonsense from happening again!"

Grandma angrily hit my back with her Cane, "Such an ungrateful wretch! The Mason Family was blind to raise you!"

The crowd began to criticize me.

"Look how you’ve pushed them, they’re rushing into marriage, what a disgrace."

"The Mason Family at least fed you, didn’t let you pick trash, and you repay them like this, what a useless thing."

"Thick-skinned, heartless, eyeing someone else's inheritance."

Someone nearby spat at me.

Others followed suit, throwing whatever they had at me.

A glass hit my head, causing blood to flow.

Bodyguards pinned me down, forcing me to kneel.

Jasper, emboldened, stepped in front of me and whispered, "You still think you're the Mason Family's Young Master?"

"Now everyone stands by me, I'm the rightful heir. So what if Grandpa returns?"

I trembled with anger, wanting to tear him apart.

Jasper stepped back and said loudly, "The Mason Family won't tolerate such nonsense. Did you think I was easy to bully?"
A glass cup smashed on my head, and blood immediately started to flow.

The bodyguards pinned my shoulders down, forcing me to kneel and making it impossible to move.

Jasper approached me, whispering with a smirk, "You still think you're the Mason Family's heir, don't you?"

"Everyone's on my side now. I'm the rightful heir of the Mason Family. Even if Grandpa comes back, what can he do?"

I was trembling with anger, desperate to tear him apart right then and there.

Jasper stepped back and deliberately shouted, "The Mason Family won't tolerate troublemakers like you. You really think you can push me around?"

In the next moment, he triumphantly poured a bottle of red wine over my head.

The alcohol stung the wound on my forehead, causing excruciating pain.

I couldn't take it anymore. I broke free from the bodyguards' grip, grabbed the wine bottle, and smashed it on the ground, pointing the jagged end at Jasper. "You really think you can steal what's mine?"

A bodyguard tried to grab me, but I swung the bottle and cut his arm.

I had completely lost it.

I walked up to my Sister, who was shaking with fear.

"Tell me who I am! Who's your real brother?"

Then, I pointed the bottle at my Fiancée, who screamed continuously.

"Say it! Tell me who I am!"

The scene descended into chaos. Grandma glanced at the Cane in her hand, furious.

"Get on with it, are you all idiots?"

The bodyguards finally rushed at me, pinning me to the ground.

Sister stepped forward and slapped me hard, saying with disdain, "Break his arms and legs! Dump him at a trash site!"

Grandma declared loudly, "Our Mason Family has no room for a madman like him! From now on, he has nothing to do with the Mason Family!"

"Cut his ties with the Mason Family!"

The Lawyer approached with disownment papers for me to sign, but I struggled desperately.

Seeing this, Jasper stomped on my hand, grinding it viciously.

"If you won't sign, then leave your handprint!"

"Stop it, all of you!"

Suddenly, dozens of black-clad bodyguards burst through the door, followed by a furious old man with white hair.

Chapter 4

Grandpa may be getting on in years, but he still moves with surprising speed, reaching me in just a few strides. Since my return, I feared being at a disadvantage, so I had already asked Grandpa to fly back early to support me.
