Married for ten years, Phoebe has been incarcerated ten times.

Each time she is released, she arrives with a newborn, leaving the chaos for me to handle.

“There are no precautions in prison, so why can't you just take care of a few more kids?”

The wives of the fathers of these children show up at my door, demanding child support and compensation for the nights they lost with their husbands.

They even injured my five-year-old son because of this.

On the day my son was seriously injured, after bearing humiliation, I hurried to pick up Phoebe from prison, only to find her friends had already organized a welcome party for her at the most luxurious restaurant.

“Phoebe, Gideon has waited for you for over a decade and has been raising kids that aren't his. He's more loyal than any devoted follower.”

“Yeah, while you've been off visiting dozens of countries under the guise of being in jail, he's been so broke he's been washing other people's clothes for money.”

Phoebe laughed, “If I weren't pregnant with Asher's child, I wouldn't have come back so soon this time. Just looking at that old fool disgusts me. But since he’s willing to be a nanny, let him serve both me and Asher well.”

My face turned pale as I left the divorce papers and walked away.

Her friends tried to calm the situation, “Come on, Gideon, we’re just joking.”

Phoebe stopped them, “If you want to leave, then leave for real. Don't come crawling back later.”

I looked at Phoebe, resolute, “I will never regret this.”

As I stepped out of the room, my younger son and daughter ran over, “Dad, where are you going?”

I hesitated, and Phoebe immediately laughed.

Her friends shouted, “Wow! That was fast. Not even half a minute!”

“No wonder he's such a devoted follower. He's getting paid, getting paid!”

Phoebe knew my weak spot.

Even if these two kids were fathered by someone else, I raised them myself.

I couldn't bear to leave them.

My son and daughter looked at me hesitantly, “Dad, what’s wrong with you? You smell awful.”

Phoebe got up and kicked me like a dog, “I heard you slept with a woman. At least wash off the stench. What would the kids think?”

I glared back at her, unable to hold back, “And what about bringing the kids to a place like this?”

At that moment, Finn came out of the bathroom, and the two kids immediately ran to hug him, “Uncle Asher, we missed you so much!”

Finn looked at me with a challenging gaze, “So, do you like your dad more or Uncle Asher?”

“Of course, Uncle Asher!”

Finn smugly handed them a piece of cake, “Uncle has a little cake for you.”

The kids, who had never seen a cake before after all these years with me, were drooling at the sight.

Finn elongated his words, “But only good kids get to eat cake.”

Before I could understand what he meant, my son lunged at me and bit me hard, “You jerk!”

My beloved daughter walked up to me, slapped me, and hugged Finn, saying, “You're a dirty nobody, poor and always with women. You're disgusting! I don't want you as my dad! I want Daddy Asher!”

Finn was extremely pleased, “Gideon, look at what you've taught the kids, using foul language and doing such things in front of them.”

Phoebe looked at me with disgust, “Is this the kind of children you raise?”

My hand, my face, and my heart all hurt.

The two kids who had just insulted me were now devouring the cake beside Finn.

They humiliated me for a piece of cake.

My heart broke, “I’m not fit to be their father. Let’s get a divorce.”

I handed the divorce papers to Phoebe again.

Phoebe walked toward me, mockingly tore up the papers, “Gideon, you know Grandma will never agree to our divorce. You want me to sign, just to tattle to Grandma about Asher? Dream on!”

“You're unbelievable!”

I was furious, thinking of my sick son at home, and was about to leave.

Phoebe grabbed my hair, “What, got a woman waiting for you in bed? We’re celebrating me being pregnant with Asher’s kid. Make us happy, and you can go.”

Her friends egged me on, “Gideon, you’re here, might as well join the fun.”

“Yeah, it’s a rare gathering. Tell us, how do you handle all those women? Still got your stamina?”

“Do you deal with them one by one, or all together? Hahaha!”

The kids finished their cake and looked at me expectantly.

I couldn't stand it, “Phoebe! The kids are here. How can you let them say such things?”

Phoebe snorted, “But you don't find it disgusting to do such things in front of them.”

“Show us how you usually take care of the kids. Or maybe, give us a demonstration?”

Her friends excitedly jumped up, “Phoebe, I’ll play the lead!”

“I’ll be the second lead!”

Without hesitation, they pulled me onto the sofa, touching me over my pants, “Gideon, don’t be shy, just let loose.”

My son and daughter stared at me, “That's not how it is! Dad is usually on the bottom!”

I couldn’t believe my ears, struggling to push away the person in front of me.

She grabbed my hand, “Oh, you like it rough.”

“Looks like you’ve been busy. Even your niece and nephew know your moves!”

My torn clothes exposed bruises and hickeys.

Extreme shame washed over me. But they were even more excited, “Such a wild man! Look at those muscles, must be a beast!”

My daughter said again, “Mom, where are the third and fourth leads? Dad likes a crowd.”

Her words shattered my worldview. I couldn't believe my cherished daughter said such things for half a piece of cake, “Nora, who taught you this nonsense!”

Frightened, my daughter hid behind Phoebe, “Mom, I’m not lying. Dad wasn’t like this before, he used to enjoy it!”

My heart went cold.

Phoebe frowned at me, “Even with scum like this, you guys can still have fun? Who knows how many diseases he has.”

The person with me was getting more excited, “Phoebe, you don’t know, experienced men are thrilling...”

The room fell silent.

Phoebe’s face turned dark, and they let go of me.

I hurriedly crawled to the corner to put on my tattered clothes.

Phoebe held Finn’s chin and said, “I don’t want Asher’s eyes dirtied. Drink all the wine on the table, consider it our celebration.”

The person was annoyed, “Such fine wine, Gideon, you’ve never seen it, right? Consider yourself lucky.”

I couldn’t handle alcohol, but for my son, I forced myself to drink.

I was dizzy, “Can I go now?”

Phoebe raised an eyebrow.

Just as I stepped out, I remembered something important and turned back.

Standing awkwardly in front of Phoebe, “Phoebe, my son is sick, I don’t have money for his treatment…”

For years, I’ve taken care of ten kids alone, with a seriously ill Grandma in the hospital, while being bullied and exploited.

I had no money for my son's treatment.

Phoebe laughed, “So, you want money. My money doesn’t grow on trees. Can’t let you take it for nothing.”

I felt a chill, “What do you want?”

“Here, you earn it by skill.”

Phoebe slapped a stack of cash on the table, “How much you get depends on your ability.”

The group got interested again, “Gideon, a drink for a bill, how about it?”

The 96-proof liquor was too much for me.

Finn whispered something to my daughter, who immediately rushed at me, slapping me hard, “Weren’t you good at drinking and sleeping with women? Why aren’t you earning money now?”

She cried and hugged Phoebe, “Mom, take me away. I don’t want to live with this dirty nobody…”

Fueled by alcohol, I lunged at Finn, “What did you say to my daughter! What have you taught her?”

Phoebe lost her patience, kicked me hard, “Gideon, are you done acting? Aren’t you disgusting enough! I’m nauseous at night, Asher can’t take it, you serve.”

I was desperate, “Phoebe, my son is really sick! I need to take care of him!”

Earlier, I was about to go to the prison to welcome Phoebe.

But those women got drunk and caused trouble, clinging to me.

My five-year-old biological son tried to protect me, but they mercilessly beat him until he was covered in blood, now lying in bed unable to move.

Phoebe sneered, “You just want to trick me into sleeping with you, right? Gideon, look at your disgusting self, which woman would want you? In my heart, there’s only Asher.”

“Take care of me until Asher’s child is born safely. I’ll have someone treat that little bastard.”

I reluctantly agreed and returned home with Phoebe. Only then did I realize she never went bankrupt.

She never went to jail.

She just avoided me, wanting to punish me.

But I didn’t care anymore. I just wanted my son to live.

In the middle of the night, Finn said he was hungry, wanting me to cook.

He ate my food and vomited.

Phoebe grabbed me up and slapped me hard, “You scum, are you trying to poison Asher?”
"You need to keep me happy until Asher's child is safely born. I'll have someone take care of that little brat."

I had no choice but to agree. I went home with Phoebe. It was then that I realized she had never gone bankrupt, nor had she been in jail. She was simply hiding from me, intent on punishing me. But I no longer cared about that; all I wanted was for my son to survive.

In the middle of the night, Finn said he was hungry and asked me to make him something to eat. After eating, he vomited everything up. Phoebe grabbed me and slapped me hard, "You scumbag, are you trying to poison Asher?"
