I noticed something strange about my wife sleeping next to me. She was unresponsive to my intimate gestures, like a dead fish.

I thought maybe after years of marriage, she had lost her passion and excitement for me.

That is, until I overheard my wife talking to her hot best friend: "My husband sleeps like the dead every night. You could put a corpse next to him and he wouldn't even notice!"

So my wife found a body double?

01

I woke up with a start, faintly hearing slight noises coming from the living room.

It sounded like someone moaning and panting.

In the pitch darkness, I couldn't help but feel a chill run down my spine. Instinctively, I reached out to nudge my wife beside me.

"Honey, I think there's someone outside..."

I pushed her a few times, but she didn't respond, seemingly fast asleep.

She must have been exhausted from the day, I thought.

In the end, I decided not to wake her. I slowly got up, grabbing a vase from the nightstand for self-defense.

Could it be a burglar?

I tiptoed out of the bedroom, the living room pitch black. After some hesitation, I mustered up the courage to feel my way to the kitchen and grab a knife.

Feeling slightly braver, I made my way to the light switch by the door and turned on all the lights.

The living room suddenly lit up. I looked around but found nothing out of place. I checked the other bedrooms too, but there were no signs of intrusion. Even our valuables were untouched.

I stood in the living room, bewildered. Had I imagined it all?

The next morning, I woke up and went to the living room to find my wife already sitting at the dining table, a radiant smile on her face as she looked at me.

"Good morning, honey! Come have breakfast!"

My wife, Lily, was tall and curvaceous, with looks that could easily be described as stunning. We had a whirlwind romance, getting married after knowing each other for just a month.

Despite the rushed nature of our marriage, our relationship had always been good. She stood by me as I went from having nothing to becoming the CEO of my own company.

I became the envy of all the men in our social circle.

After my business took off, she quit her job to become a full-time housewife.

The only regret was that after six years of marriage, we still didn't have a child to show for our love.

We initially thought there might be some health issues, but medical check-ups showed we were both perfectly healthy. Perhaps it just wasn't the right time yet.

I sat down after washing up and took a bite of the warm sandwich.

Remembering last night's incident, I couldn't help but ask her about it.

Lily rolled her eyes and said impatiently, "Honey, were you dreaming?"

I wanted to say more, but she had already gotten up, telling me, "Alright, you need to get to the office. Hurry up and eat! I'm going back for a nap. For some reason, I've been feeling really sleepy lately."

Lily stretched and walked past me towards the bedroom. I don't know if it was my imagination, but I thought I caught a faint strange odor coming from her.

Without thinking too much about it, I quickly finished my breakfast and headed to the office.

The next night, I don't know how long I had been asleep when I was once again startled awake.

The panting sounds outside were even louder this time.

I got up to check, but again found nothing missing.

My scalp tingled with fear. Could it be not a burglar, but a ghost in our house?

I'm an atheist, but at that moment, the only explanation I could think of, besides a haunting, was beyond me.

However, for the next two weeks, everything seemed to return to normal. The eerie sounds never resurfaced.

I thought the matter had come to an end, but little did I know it was just the beginning.

One night, I had a vivid dream. In it, Lily and I were passionately intimate. But just as things were getting intense, I suddenly woke up.

The lingering desire from the dream left my entire body feeling like it was on fire.

I couldn't help but snuggle closer to Lily's body, softly calling out to her.

"Honey, are you asleep?"

Just like before, I called out to her many times, but she didn't respond. It felt like lying next to a corpse.

02

But I was already too consumed by endless desire to let her be.

I went from softly calling her name to shaking her vigorously.

"Honey, wake up."

Just as my mind was starting to form some unpleasant suspicions,

Lily finally showed a slight reaction. She mumbled in a faint voice, "Sleeping."

Of course, I wasn't going to give up. I pressed closer to her body again, whispering in her ear, "Honey, it's been so long since we've been intimate. How about we go wild tonight?"

As I spoke, my hands started to wander.

She didn't refuse me, so I became even bolder in my actions.

However, I vaguely felt that the skin I was touching was cold, unlike my wife's usual soft and warm body.

Moreover, the scent on her body seemed different from before, giving me a strange sense of novelty.

But just as my hand was about to reach her peaks, she suddenly grabbed my hand.

"No... not now, I need to take a shower first."

Before I could react, she had already scrambled out of bed, wrapped herself in the blanket, and stumbled out of the room in the dark.

Watching this series of actions left me bewildered.

But since she wanted to shower, I could only wait silently, hoping she would be quick.

However, after waiting in the room for a long time, I was starting to doze off. So I got up, intending to go and hurry her along.

Suddenly, I heard voices coming from the living room.

To my surprise, there was another woman in the living room besides my wife Lily.

It was Lily's best friend, Rachel. I had met her a few times before. Rachel was equally stunning in terms of both figure and looks, certainly not inferior to my wife.

Today, she was wearing only a thin T-shirt on top, which perfectly accentuated her flawless figure. She had on a pair of extremely short denim shorts, revealing long, snow-white legs.

She was the type of beauty that would make anyone's imagination run wild after just one glance.

For some reason, Rachel's expression didn't look good, seeming to contain a hint of fear.

"When did you get here?" I asked.

Lily immediately linked arms with Rachel and said to me with a beaming smile, "She just arrived, honey. There's been some disturbance downstairs at Rachel's place lately. She couldn't stand it anymore, so she came to stay with us for the night."

Hearing this, I nodded.

I was about to turn and go back to the bedroom when I suddenly noticed something odd.

"Hey, honey, weren't you taking a shower? Why are you still wearing a dress?"

Lily had said earlier that she was going to shower, but now she was wearing neither pajamas nor a nightgown, but a tight-fitting bodycon dress that she would wear to go out.

She even had high heels on her feet.

Lily rolled her eyes at my question and said impatiently, "Well, Rachel just called me to come down and let her in. I couldn't exactly go down wrapped in a towel, could I?"

I didn't think much of it and turned to go back to the bedroom.

The earlier feeling of arousal was gone, and considering how late it was and that I had an early meeting at the company tomorrow, I ended up falling asleep without continuing what we had left unfinished with my wife.

However, little did I know that Rachel's appearance at our home tonight was not as simple as my wife had made it out to be.

03

A week later, I had finished my work at the office and had nothing else to do, so I fell asleep in my office chair. I slept deeply, as I had indeed been under a lot of stress lately.

By nighttime, because I had rested for so long during the day, I wasn't sleeping as heavily. I woke up groggily to find my wife not in bed.

I initially thought she was in the bathroom and didn't think much of it, preparing to go back to sleep.

But suddenly, I heard whispered voices coming from outside the door.

Could it be my wife talking on the phone with someone?

A feeling of unease immediately welled up in my heart. So late at night, my wife wasn't in the room but secretly making a call in the living room. Had our marriage hit a rough patch?

I hurriedly went to the door, pressing myself against it as if trying to meld into it. I could hear my wife's voice from outside.

"Rachel, please help me out. Hasn't your company not paid salaries for months now? If you help me, I'll add another thousand... no, two thousand. How about that?"

So she was talking to Rachel. The heart that had jumped to my throat relaxed a bit. But suddenly, Rachel's voice rang out. It wasn't the sound of a phone call; she was right there in the living room with my wife.

"No, no, Lily. Even if I'm desperate for money, I can't agree to this. Last time we almost got caught by your husband..."

I was stunned. What had they almost been caught doing?

My wife continued, "Don't worry, that was just a fluke. I promise it won't happen again."

"Look, if you agree, I'll not only give you an extra two thousand, but I'll also have my husband arrange a position for you at his company. The salary will definitely be higher than at your previous company."

Rachel seemed to fall silent.

I listened, completely confused. What extra money? What was Lily asking Rachel to agree to? And how was I involved in all this? What on earth was going on?

After a long while, under Lily's urging, Rachel seemed to waver, but she said, "Oh, Lily, I really don't understand why you're doing this. It's clear that your husband truly loves you. Why don't you two just have a baby? Maybe that would change your mind."

My heart, which had just settled, leapt up again.

Although Lily's voice wasn't loud, I could still hear a hint of dismissiveness in her words.

"I don't want to turn into a frumpy housewife because of a kid. I still want to enjoy life for a few more years. You have no idea, every time I'm intimate with my husband, I secretly take contraceptives afterward."

"I can't live without the strong bodies of those young studs out there!"

Hearing this, I nearly collapsed to the ground. So the so-called full-time housewife was actually going out to party behind my back every day. All that talk about not being able to live without it was just an excuse.

And the reason we hadn't had a child in all these years was also due to her secret manipulations.

Disbelief, pain, and anger instantly flooded my mind. I wanted to rush out and slap her hard, demanding to know why she would do this.

But just then, she spoke again, pleading with Rachel.

"Come on, Rachel. My husband has been under a lot of stress lately. He's sleeping like the dead every night. You could put a corpse next to him and he wouldn't even notice!"

A lightning bolt flashed through my mind, and an unbelievable suspicion formed in my thoughts.
