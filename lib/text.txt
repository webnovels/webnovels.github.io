 My Husband Tricked Me into Taking on Debts
 https://al-img.yootang.com/img/view/id/60918
In order to pay off the debts of my husband, Scott Moore, who had failed in his investment, and also to treat my daughter, Laura Moore, I worked as a waitress during the day, delivered food on takeout orders at night, and even sold one of my kidneys on the black market.
Right after getting off the operating table in that illegal clinic, I insisted on hurrying to the wealthy villa area to do the cleaning job.
My colleague said enviously, "Be careful when you're washing this precious floor. This villa, worth fifty million dollars, was given by Mr. Moore to his fiancée. That woman is so lucky. I heard that just because she threw a tantrum once, Mr. Moore bought her a luxury car worth over ten million dollars in full payment."
I clenched my fists tightly and felt an icy chill all over my body.
There was a photo of them on the bedside table. On the messy big bed were black silk stockings stained with some white substance.
The man who was smiling gently in the photo, the one my colleague had just mentioned, turned out to be my husband, who had already gone bankrupt.
Chapter 1
Laura's heart disease suddenly got worse. The doctor called me in a hurry and said that a suitable heart donor that matched her had been found.
I cried and begged the doctor to give me more time to raise the money, but all the money in our family was with Scott.
I called him several times, and he hung up on me again and again.
When I finally managed to get the call through, he roared impatiently, "Angela! I'm talking about cooperation with the investor! Can you stop bothering me?"
As soon as he finished speaking, he hung up the phone.
In a desperate situation, I could only clutch that advertisement for selling a kidney on the utility pole.
Just coming out of that small clinic, I didn't care about the wound on my waist that was still bleeding, and I stumbled back to the hospital.
After signing my name on the operation consent form, I finally felt at ease.
Laura looked at me with tears and said, "Mom, is my illness never going to get better? Don't spend any more money on me..."
I stroked her pale face and comforted her, "Don't worry. I've raised the money. You'll get better right after the operation tomorrow!"
But thinking of the huge debts Scott owed, the medical expenses and the money for nutritional supplements after Laura's operation, I endured the sharp pain of the wound on my waist and went to the housekeeping company to do the cleaning job again.
I could earn one hundred dollars for doing a cleaning job, and then I could buy some nutritional products for them at night.
I was working in the wealthy villa area, and maybe I could get more tips.
When I got to the door of the villa, there was still a bit of hope in my heart.
But when I saw that couple photo with dazzling crystals on the bedside table, I froze.
In the photo, Scott was dressed in a suit, wearing an expensive watch that I had never seen before. He was so different from the husband I remembered, who claimed to be bankrupt and lived a thrifty life.
The beautiful woman snuggling closely beside him was exactly the investor he had mentioned every day, Sarah Jensen!
The mop in my hand dropped to the ground.
I took out my phone with trembling hands. The screensaver of my phone was a photo of him and me smiling.
I thought, "Could he have a twin brother?"
But I quickly dismissed this absurd idea. I was too familiar with that small mole at the corner of his eye in the photo.
I stood there stiffly, not even having the courage to call and question him.
My colleague pushed me and said, "Angela, what are you doing? The house owner, Ms. Jensen, will come to check soon!"
I quickly pulled up my mask and covered my face with the brim of my hat, only daring to look around with the corner of my eyes.
Scott walked in confidently, wearing a neat and high-class suit with one hand in his pocket.
My eyes were bloodshot. I forced myself to start mopping the floor. When I was cleaning the living room, my fingertips hooked out a small ball of used tissue from the gap in the sofa. It was stained with glaring lipstick marks, and there were also several obviously used condoms beside it.
Feeling a sharp pain in my chest, I forced myself to hold back my nausea and threw those dirty things into the trash can.
My colleague leaned over and whispered with a sigh, "Rich people know how to have fun! Mr. Moore is so generous that he must have spoiled Ms. Jensen!"
Another colleague said, "Yeah. He's rich and handsome. Ms. Jensen is lucky!"
Those harsh words cut into my heart like knives. I covered my mouth tightly to keep myself from vomiting.
"Scott, I've brought Kelly back." Sarah walked in holding the hand of a pretty little girl.
Sarah's niece smiled and jumped into Scott's arms, saying, "Mr. Moore! My aunt said we're going to have a big dinner tonight!"
He stroked Kelly's head affectionately and said, "I've booked an entire cruise ship tonight. Kelly, you will like it!"
Sarah giggled and leaned close to Scott, standing on tiptoe and saying, "Honey, where's my kiss for greeting today?"
He smiled and kissed her on the lips, asking, "Didn't I satisfy you yesterday?"
Chapter 2
Sarah playfully punched Scott's chest, looking a bit shy.
When he saw that the villa had been tidied up, he waved at me and stuffed a thick stack of banknotes into my hand, not even glancing at me.
Holding this tip of nearly ten thousand dollars, I was stunned.
The money he gave so casually was enough for me to work hard for a whole month.
The money he spent on booking that cruise ship was enough to pay for Laura's heart transplant.
Seeing me standing there without moving, Sarah looked at my old, pilling and faded clothes with contempt and said, "Bumpkin, leave here. Do you think this tip is too little?"
Her mockery made my heart ache, and I felt like crying.
But Scott looked at me in surprise and said, "Why are you..."
I was surprised and was afraid that he would call out my name the next second.
"There's blood on your clothes. It's so disgusting. Don't scare Kelly." As he said this, he looked away in disgust and pulled them upstairs.
I smiled bitterly. My wound had opened up, staining a large patch of my white clothes red.
Sarah, who was standing beside him, was tall and beautiful, wearing an exquisite suit, while I was like a clown, clutching the tip he had given me in a sorry state.
I thought we were husband and wife who shared both good and bad times, but he had turned into a rich president.
My efforts over the past few years must be just a joke in his eyes.
My colleague handed me an envelope out of a bit of curiosity and said, "Do you know Ms. Jensen before? She asked me to give this to you."
I frowned and took it.
I found an acquaintance in a nearby grocery store and borrowed the computer in the store. I inserted the USB drive in the envelope into the computer.
Dozens of videos immediately popped up on the screen. There were videos of Sarah and Scott celebrating Kelly's birthday.
In front of them was a huge cake that was over a dozen layers high, and beside it were piled up expensive toys that Laura had always dreamed of having.
Scott accompanied them to the parent-child sports meeting in the kindergarten, with a big smile on his face.
His laughter mixed with Kelly's sweet laughter. This warm and happy scene made my heart ache.
They were wearing matching family outfits, looking like a happy family.
I stared blankly at the screen until the last video popped up. Scott was lying naked in Sarah's arms and said, "How is Laura? When are you going to let her return to the Moore family? I'm tired of testing them for seven years. It's all your fault for making that bet with me in the first place. That bumpkin's daughter is still waiting for a heart transplant. If we bring her back now and she sees our family's wealth and power, she will be jealous."
It seemed as if Laura wasn't his daughter at all.
The way he talked about Laura made my heart ache so much that I could hardly breathe.
He knew she was waiting for help. He could find the best doctors, easily afford the operation fees, and even find a suitable heart, but he chose to do nothing.
He was just so heartless, watching me risk my life to earn money and watching Laura suffer from the illness.
Scott and I met in an orphanage.
I was an orphan. After growing up, I often went back to visit the director and those children. That was where I met Scott, who came to be a volunteer.
He said he was also an orphan and wanted to help the children have a better life.
We got to know each other, fell in love, and finally got married.
Because I refused to accept those unspoken rules and offended a big boss, I was blacklisted by the whole industry. I could only do odd jobs, and our life became tough.
Scott had always accompanied me through those hard times and never complained until the year Laura was born, when Scott said he had failed in an investment, gone bankrupt, and owed debts.
I sold my house to pay off his debts. We moved into a shabby shed in the suburbs.
At that time, Scott held me and cried, vowing to be good to me and Laura for the rest of his life.
But in the end, he didn't keep his promise.
Chapter 3
Just because of that mean joke between him and Sarah, I and Laura became the victims.
I couldn't let out a scream. My mouth was full of the taste of blood.
I wiped the tears off my face randomly and forced a smile as I pushed open the door of Laura's ward and said, "Laura, I bought you some chicken soup. Do you feel better now?"
Laura's face was pale, and she said helplessly, "Mom, I'm going to have an operation tomorrow, and I have to fast today."
I was stunned for a moment. I was so stimulated by Scott that my mind was all messed up.
I was angry at myself for forgetting about this and picked up a cotton swab to wet Laura's chapped lips with water.
She held my hand tightly and asked gently, "Mom, is Dad still busy? I miss him so much."
Looking at her, I couldn't tell her the truth.
I stroked Laura's head lovingly and said, "You'll see Dad before your operation tomorrow."
I planned to beg Scott to come and stay with her.
After being a clown in their rich people's game for seven years, my dignity seemed to be worth nothing.
After Laura fell asleep, I went to find the doctor to confirm the specific time of tomorrow's operation.
I squatted on the floor of the corridor with my back against the cold wall, and only then did I become a bit more clear-headed.
Taking out my phone, I called Scott.
This time, he picked up the phone quickly. "Angela, what's up? I'm accompanying the investor right now. If we can seal this deal, we can get out of our current tough situation!"
Over these seven years, he had always used such words to deceive me, and every time I had believed him.
At first, Scott pretended to have found a job of moving bricks on a construction site.
Seeing that his hands were red and swollen, I told him to focus on finding investors and that I would earn the money.
But he just had fun all day long and left us at home to suffer.
The music on the phone was loud.
I guessed that he was probably still on the cruise ship with Kelly.
I controlled my emotions, took a deep breath, and then said, "Scott, Laura is going to have an operation tomorrow. Can you come and stay with her? You know she misses you a lot..." 
My words were coldly interrupted by Scott before I could finish, "Angela, what on earth has been wrong with you recently? You know I'm busy, yet you keep bothering me! I'm working so hard just to make sure you can live a good life!"
Listening to him yelling at me so confidently, I gave a bitter smile.
After calming down, I said in a hoarse voice, "Scott, it doesn't matter if you think I'm silly and unsophisticated. But Laura is your daughter. Do you really not care about her at all?"
Scott paused for a moment and said in a flustered manner, "Angela, what nonsense are you talking about? I'll go to the hospital as soon as I'm done here."
I looked at Laura through the glass of the ward, and my whole body trembled.
She was curled up under the thick quilt, looking so weak.
When she was just born, she couldn't even open her eyes and would hold my finger with her soft little hand.
Laura had poor health and had never been to kindergarten, even for a day. She only knew me and Scott.
But the father she relied on had never really cared about her.
I couldn't hold on any longer and started crying.
I didn't expect that Scott would actually come.
Maybe in his heart, he still cared about Laura.
The red marks on his neck hadn't faded yet, and he rushed into the ward wearing those old patched-up clothes.
Looking at the sweat beads still dripping down from his forehead, I had mixed feelings.
For a moment, I almost thought that we were still a poor but loving family.
I thought that suffering wasn't a big deal. As long as we loved each other, we could get through any difficulties together, until a flash of gold on his wrist caught my attention.
That expensive watch brought me back to reality.
Chapter 4
When Laura saw Scott coming, she said happily, "Dad, you haven't come to see me for a long time. I miss you so much."
He smiled awkwardly and said, "Sorry, I've been really busy recently. Laura, when you open your eyes after the operation, we'll be here with you."
Before the operation, Laura looked at me nervously and asked expectantly, "Mom, can I have a doll as a reward?"
I almost burst into tears.
The birthday gift Scott bought for Kelly was a truckload of expensive imported dolls, while Laura's dolls were all handmade by me.
I quickly nodded and agreed, "Laura, I'll go and buy it for you right now!"
I immediately ran out. Worrying about Laura, I just wanted to come back quickly.
But the doll that Laura wanted had already been out of production. I ran to several stores and finally managed to contact a toy merchant to buy it.
Holding the doll excitedly, I rushed back to the hospital. But suddenly, the phone in my pocket rang loudly.
It was a call from the nurse. Her voice was trembling as she said, "Ms. Turner! Something terrible has happened. That heart has been snatched away! Laura is still on the operating table. Come back quickly!"
My face turned pale, and I almost couldn't stand up.
A kind passerby saw my pale face and sent me back to the hospital. By then, I was soaked in cold sweat all over.
I stumbled to the door of the operating room. The nurse waiting there sighed, "Your husband has already gone to the transplant bank and taken the heart away."
These words shattered all my hopes.
I took out my phone with trembling hands, wanting to call Scott, but my fingers were shaking so badly that I couldn't even press the dial button.
The nurse reached out pityingly and took the phone that I could hardly hold.
The call actually got through quickly. He said, "Honey, I have something urgent..."
I didn't want to listen to his lies anymore. I roared at him in a hoarse voice, "Where is Laura's heart?"
He paused for a moment and quickly explained, "Angela, the niece of my investor has also matched the heart. Laura can wait a little longer. This time, we'll just let..."
I was so angry that my voice was shaking as I interrupted him, "Laura is on the operating table waiting for the heart to save her life! Hurry up and bring the heart back! The operation is already halfway through! How could you do this?"
Scott sighed impatiently, "You're usually so generous. What's wrong with you today? Laura will still have a chance in the future. I took the heart all for you! As long as Sarah is happy and she makes an investment, there will be money for Laura's treatment, and you can live a good life too! I'm doing this for your own good!"
Before I could reply, he hung up the phone.
I called him like crazy one after another. He just turned off his phone.
Thinking of Laura, who was still waiting for the heart in the operating room, my heart ached so much that I couldn't breathe, and I knelt on the ground.
I stared blankly at the still-lit red light of the operating room and thought, "Scott made Laura lose the chance to live. His love is like this."
The nurse beside me sighed, "You can go and ask in other hospitals. My friend said that their hospital also has a heart transplant operation today, and they just got a heart donor. Laura's operation has already started and can't be delayed any longer."
My shoes had already worn out. My soles hurt and were bleeding.
But I couldn't feel the pain and ran like crazy towards the hospital that the nurse mentioned.
Chapter 5
Stumbling and rushing to the VIP passage, I was stopped by the bodyguards.
