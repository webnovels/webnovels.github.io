 My Parents Don't Love Me, Their Real Daughter, And Even Expose Me To AIDS
 https://al-img.yootang.com/img/view/id/60916



I, Olivia Winchester, was abducted and sold when I was a little kid. After I managed to escape with great difficulty, I found out that I was actually the real daughter of the Winchester family.
But my biological parents didn't love me. Instead, they doted on their fake daughter, Shirley Winchester.
During an emergency surgery, my mom and dad had put on their protective suits. And my brother, Isaac Winchester, clung tightly to Shirley, shielding her and insisting that she shouldn't be the one to do this surgery.
Yet, not a single person bothered to tell me that the patient had AIDS and that the doctor performing the operation needed to wear protective gear.
Just like that, I was left exposed to the patient with my wounds out in the open.
After going through such a life-and-death ordeal, what little affection I had for my family was completely drained, and I finally gave up on them.
After the surgery was over, I calmly picked up the phone and made an anonymous tip. "I want to report a colleague for deliberately concealing the patient's medical history, which put me at risk of being exposed to AIDS."
Chapter 1
"Why aren't you wearing protective gear, Olivia?!"
The shocked voice of my colleague, Jeana Louis, came from the doorway, with a hint of terror hidden in her eyes.
I didn't know what she meant at first. I was stunned for a moment and asked instinctively, "Why say so?"
I hadn't heard that the patient had a history of infectious diseases.
But Jeana backed away repeatedly as if she was avoiding the plague.
Standing as far away from me as possible, she said in a hurried tone, "This patient has AIDS and syphilis. You can't come into contact with him. Didn't Mr. Nathan Winchester tell you that?
"Oh my goodness, are you crazy? How could you perform the surgery without any protective measures at all?
"How old are you? Do you want to get infected with such a disease? Didn't your teacher remind you during your internship?"
Looking at my parents in their thick protective suits and Shirley being shielded by Isaac, I was dazed for a moment.
AIDS couldn't be cured in the medical field for the time being. Once I was infected, I would carry the virus for life.
After my heart skipped a beat, I stiffly turned my head and looked at Isaac, who was keeping Shirley behind him.
He was the best anesthesiologist in the hospital, and it was his responsibility to check the patient's medical history before the operation.
Words of accusation were on the tip of my tongue, but in the end, I joked, "Isaac, Jeana is just kidding, right? I didn't hear about any infectious diseases before I came in..."
"The patient does have AIDS. This emergency rescue was unexpected, and I didn't have time to tell you," he said.
The smile on my face froze. My own brother just dismissed me with those few casual words.
"Olivia, you've always been in good health, so it's okay. Shirley is in poor health, so that's why I didn't let her assist with this surgery. Weren't you always complaining that we were biased? Now that you've participated in this operation, you should be happy," Isaac said.
I couldn't hear what he said next.
My head was buzzing, my face turned pale, my hands were shaking uncontrollably, and tears were gradually welling up in my eyes.
In the silence, I let out a scream. "Why didn't you tell me!"
This was an infectious disease. Even if I wasn't their sister or daughter, but just an ordinary colleague, they should have told me the patient's past medical history.
My heart turned completely cold, but then I heard my mother, Cara Winchester, complaining impatiently, "Olivia, can you stop ruining the mood?
"Your father and I guessed that you would put on this affected act, so we decided not to tell you. Besides, you're just a junior nurse. It doesn't matter whether you know the patient's medical history or not. Shirley already knew about it, but she didn't back down either."
I laughed self-deprecatingly. "She's the furthest away from the patient and has the most comprehensive protective measures. Dad, Mom, Isaac, she's the apple of your eyes, but aren't I your family member too? Why didn't you tell me about this?"
In the silence, the operation went on in an orderly manner.
My father, Nathan Winchester, didn't even bother to spare me a glance.
It wasn't until the stitches were done that he snapped, "Olivia, you're being so unreasonable! Your mother and I clearly taught you that family scandals should not be made public."
Chapter 2
There was nothing but blame in his tone. No one could remain calm when they learned that they might be infected with AIDS.
What's more, I had a wound on my hand.
I stared at them blankly and finally realized that since I entered the operating room, they had been wrapped up tightly, wearing masks, goggles, and even double-layered rubber gloves. Throughout the operation, Isaac had seriously shielded Shirley behind him, preventing her from getting close to the operating table.
I had thought that Shirley was scared, and because my parents had been constantly ordering me to assist them, I was so busy that I was sweating all over and didn't have the time to pay attention to their strange attire.
It turned out that they were so afraid that Shirley might be in danger that they gave this opportunity to me.
My hands were shaking more and more, and I couldn't help but think about how painful it would be if I were infected and had to go through the treatment in the future.
But Cara was still scolding me. "The operation is done, and you didn't have any accidents. I think you're just being overly sensitive."
But this disease has an incubation period. I felt as if all the blood in my body had turned cold at that moment.
Once I came to my senses, I immediately left the operating room, disinfected myself, took the anti-retroviral drugs, and washed my hands countless times.
In the end, I lost my strength and leaned against the wall, tears streaming down my face uncontrollably.
Isaac never ate on time. Yesterday, I was worried that he would be hungry during his shift at the hospital, so I cooked his favorite steak sandwich myself.
However, when I was cutting the meat, I accidentally cut my index finger.
At that time, when I was holding the lunch box and casually mentioned that I had accidentally cut my hand and it hurt a bit, Isaac even took the first aid kit to put medicine on my wound and told me to have a good rest.
He was the most outstanding graduate of his class. He definitely couldn't have been unaware that AIDS was more likely to be transmitted when there was a wound, not to mention that the patient was constantly spitting up blood.
I couldn't help but wonder if Isaac really wanted me to die.

While waiting for the test results, my heart was pounding wildly.
On the other hand, my parents, who had finished the operation, didn't care at all where I had gone. When they passed by me, they didn't even glance at me.
Holding Shirley's hands on both sides, they asked gently with soft expressions, "Shirley, you've worked hard during this operation. What would you like to have for dinner? That new French restaurant? Okay, it's on us. We'll take you there."
I opened my mouth, but I didn't know what to say. I just stared blankly as they walked away.
Ever since I was found by my family, my parents had never called me like that. They were not even willing to say one more word to me.
"Olivia, come here."
"Olivia, time for dinner."
"Olivia, Shirley has a math problem she can't solve. Teach her."
After I joined the hospital, their tone towards me was nothing but commands.
At this moment, Isaac said, "What are you standing there for? Didn't you hear that we're having a family dinner? Hurry up."
These words instantly woke me up, and I instinctively looked up at Isaac.
He frowned, still looking as unapproachable as ever, making people reluctant to get close to him casually.
Perhaps seeing the tears that hadn't dried on my face yet, he rarely softened his tone and said, "It was indeed my oversight not to tell you the patient's past medical history. I'm sorry. But Dad is about to be promoted to vice president of the hospital, and you'll benefit more when you work here in the future. So, stop making a fuss, okay? The hospital is really busy."
Finally, after thinking for a while, he added, "Also, Shirley has already gotten off work. You can help her write the report. I'll send you the location of the family dinner on your phone later. You made a scene just now, and Mom and Dad are very unhappy. Apologize to them later."
He still spoke to me in a commanding tone, sounding cold and distant, as if he was just giving orders to a subordinate.
Chapter 3
When I heard Isaac say that I would benefit from it, I laughed. But as I laughed, I couldn't hold back a few tears.
Ever since I started working in the hospital, I had been doing the toughest jobs, while Shirley always got the easiest ones.
My parents were so afraid that she would get tired that they told all our colleagues that Shirley was too young to endure hardship.
Once, I accidentally overheard Cara saying, "Don't let Shirley get too tired. But you can ask Olivia to do the odd jobs. She wasn't with us when she was a kid, so she can take the hardship."
She evaded the important facts and ignored the truth that I had been abducted when I was a child. She just said that I could endure hardship, while Shirley, who was showered with all the love, couldn't.
Even though Shirley's grades were so poor that no hospital was willing to hire her, it was my parents who pulled some strings to get her in.
During my internship, I was busy doing the work of two people all by myself. I had to write two reports. Most of the time, I didn't even have time to eat. I was so exhausted that I would fall asleep as soon as I fell onto the bed.
This was what Isaac meant by me benefiting from it.
I forcefully held back my sobs and asked sharply, "Isaac, isn't my life and safety important? It's AIDS we're talking about! Once infected, I'll carry it for life. I'm only twenty years old! If I'm really infected, the consequences will be unimaginable..."
Before I could finish speaking, I was interrupted. Isaac frowned even more. He sneered and scolded me in a mean tone, "Are you done? You're fine now, aren't you? You're already a nurse. Can't you stop being so delicate? I thought you had become independent and strong-willed since you were found..."
He shook his head in disappointment as if he had sentenced me to death. "You're totally hopeless now."
These words were so ironic.
My heart, which had been filled with negative emotions, now deflated like a punctured balloon.
I felt weak and defeated, and suddenly I thought of the day I was first found and brought back home.
I was led by Isaac, tightly clutching the hem of my washed-out white dress, and my heart was pounding.
I told myself in my heart that I had to stay calm, that I had to make my family like me and not drive me away.
Then, I saw Shirley wearing an expensive little dress, walking down the magnificent spiral staircase step by step.
She came up to me, took a good look at me, and then asked innocently, "Isaac, who is she? Is she the new servant in our house?"
Isaac's mouth was set in a tight line. He squeezed my hand a little harder, but he never denied what she said. He just said, "From now on, she'll be your elder sister."
*****
At first, I was a bit resentful.
Due to my parents' negligence, I got lost and after going through a lot of twists and turns, I was finally sold to a poor rural area. 
I had been missing for five years.
There, not only did I have to do the laundry and cooking, take care of an elderly person who couldn't get out of bed, and even had to deal with her excrement right on the bed, but I also had to endure hunger.
I refused to give up and studied hard. It was not until the family relaxed their vigilance that I walked for three days and three nights to the town and reported to the police.
I thought that after being rescued, I could finally return to my happy home. However, by then, there was no place for me in the family anymore.
Shirley had already become the apple of the whole family's eye.
After I got lost, my parents transferred all their guilt towards me onto Shirley, who bore some resemblance to me. Most of the time, they even instinctively showed favoritism towards her.
Even if I just ate a piece of beef, they would scold me, "Shirley likes this. Can't you wait until she's finished eating? Why are you so gluttonous? It's not like you've never eaten it before."
But I really hadn't had meat for a long time.
So I silently put down my fork, held back my grievances and sadness, and placed the plate of beef in front of Shirley, fearing that if I did something wrong, they might abandon me and I would be sent back to that rural area again.
I gave in a great deal. Even three years ago, I gave up my secret crush.
I wondered, "Haven't I done enough? Why won't my family fully accept me?"
*****
A long time passed, so long that my colleagues all left work. Isaac glanced at his phone and said impatiently, "Stop playing the victim. Jeana just told me you've already taken the meds, so you'll be fine!"
Another message popped up on his phone. He took a look and then sneered at me, "Shirley was worried you'd have a meltdown and asked me to comfort you. So cut out that fake act of yours."
I came back to myself, licked my dry lips, and after a moment's hesitation, said, "Thank her for me."
In truth, my heart was breaking.
After being treated so unfairly by their own flesh and blood, no one could pretend nothing had happened. But I knew that even if I was suffering to the point of collapse, no one would care. My parents would just think I was being dramatic, and Shirley would just wipe her tears, hold my hand, and say in a weepy voice, "Olivia, I wish it had been me who got abducted instead..."
Seemingly caught off guard by my response, Isaac froze for a moment before snapping, "Look at the mess you've made of yourself!"
Before I could reply, he rushed off, no doubt to join the family dinner.
After Isaac left, I stood there, rooted to the spot. The words my family had said echoed in my ears, each one twisting the knife in my heart.
"When will you be as sensible as Shirley?"
"Can't you stop looking so gloomy all the time?"
"If you make Shirley cry again, get out of this house!"
These heartless words were like a sharp blade, severing the last thread of warmth between me and this family. I was abducted at eleven and found at sixteen, and I'd tiptoed around them ever since. Now, at twenty-one, I finally realized that my own flesh and blood truly didn't give a damn whether I lived or died.
I suddenly burst into laughter. It was as if a part of my heart reserved for family was cracking open, and a knife was slowly cutting away every bit of affection I'd held for them.
As the wounds began to heal, I placed my hand over my beating heart and was surprised to find that I really didn't care anymore. I no longer cared about my parents' love, Isaac's disdain, or Shirley's constant provocation.
Clumsily, I took out my phone and dialed the local health department's number. I poured out all the words I'd been holding back for so long. "I want to report my colleagues for concealing a patient's AIDS history and putting me at risk of infection."

Chapter 4
After I finally saw things clearly, it was like a heavy cloud that had been weighing me down for ages suddenly lifted.
