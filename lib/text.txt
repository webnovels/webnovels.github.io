 Back from the dead, I'm going to make my pseudo-paralyzed parents pay for their evil deeds.

Upon being reborn, the first thing I did was grab a stick and swing it at my supposedly paralyzed parents.

In my previous life, when both my parents became paralyzed, the responsibility of caring for my younger brother fell entirely on me. I had to drop out of school to support the family. Later, I worked three jobs until my brother was accepted into Stanford University.

When I returned to my hometown to share this good news with my parents, I discovered that my supposedly paralyzed parents were standing like normal people. They were holding a girl who looked remarkably like me, affectionately calling her their daughter. In disbelief, I approached them, but they impatiently pushed me to the ground.

Through their disdainful conversation, I learned that I was actually the daughter of Mr. Johnson, the Billionaire, and had been swapped with their biological daughter when I was young.

"If we hadn't needed you to support our Chloe, we would have left you to fend for yourself on the streets long ago."

"Now that Chloe is in university, you are of no use to us anymore. You can go straight to hell."

At my mother's command, the bodyguards came forward to restrain me. My brother, whom I had protected since childhood, just stood by indifferently, watching as I was beaten to death.

When I opened my eyes again, I was back on the day my parents announced their paralysis.

"Oh, Ethan, it's truly pitiful for you and your wife to suffer like this. Your youngest son is still so young, and now you're both paralyzed?"

"Logan, you have to be responsible in the future. Your Chloe is still young, and the whole family will depend on you."

Listening to the neighbors' sincere or gloating advice, I looked once more at my parents sitting in wheelchairs. I was momentarily stunned—I had been reborn.

In my previous life, when I returned home from school, the house was already surrounded by many people. The Community Leader stood among the crowd, telling me with a serious expression that my parents had been in an accident at the construction site, were injured, and both were now completely paralyzed. I cried until I fainted.

When I woke up, my parents had returned, sitting in wheelchairs. My brother was already in a daze, terrified by the sudden change. I couldn’t manage school while taking care of three people, so I had to drop out. Later, my brother grew up and had to go to high school in the city. I worked three jobs alone, hired a Caregiver for my parents, and rented a place in the city to cook and do laundry for my brother.

My efforts paid off when my brother got into Stanford University. When I received the good news, I immediately bought a ticket back to my hometown. I was about to share the good news with my parents in person when I saw my supposedly paralyzed parents standing energetically in the house, holding a girl who looked just like me. There was no sign of their previous illness on their faces.

In contrast, I looked older than them due to long-term malnutrition. Trembling from the betrayal, I approached them for answers, but they disdainfully pushed me away, making me fall to the ground.

"You're naturally destined for a miserable life; you're lucky to resemble our Sophie a little."

"There's no harm in telling you; your real dad is Mr. Johnson, the Billionaire from Los Angeles. But now, he's Sophie's dad."

"If we didn't need you to support our Chloe to university, we would have let you sleep on the streets long ago. Now, you're no longer of any value and should go to hell, so our Sophie can rest easy."

Only then did I understand that I wasn't their biological child. They pretended to be disabled to avoid raising me, a burden, while allowing me to raise Chloe. And Chloe, whom I had raised with my own hands, stood by coldly, watching it all, as the bodyguards held me down until I was beaten to death.

When I opened my eyes again, I was back on the day my parents announced their paralysis. Looking at them being pushed in by the Caregiver, still pretending to be unconscious, I suppressed my inner rage until the visiting villagers left. Then I took a stick from the corner and walked toward them.

They wanted to pretend to be crippled? I was going to see how long they could keep it up! Overwhelming hatred surged in my heart. Why should they enjoy an easy life without lifting a finger while I gave up everything? I suppressed my expression, lifted their pants, and swung the stick at their thighs.

When I saw their exposed leg muscles, I couldn't help but shout out in surprise. My shout attracted some villagers who hadn't gone far. When they saw my parents' legs, a few uncles who got close were also surprised and stunned.

The Caregiver, who was waiting outside to watch the show, came in and was so angry her face twisted. But I was left with only shock in my heart. It seemed my parents had put in a lot of effort to pretend to be crippled. Even though I hit them with full force, they didn't make a sound, only their leg muscles trembled uncontrollably.

I sneered; they probably ground their teeth to dust. The Caregiver came over and pushed me.

"Logan, how could you hit your own parents? Truly unfilial!"

"If they hadn't worked so hard to earn those words for you to live comfortably, they wouldn't have suffered like this! And you still hit them!"

With what the Caregiver said, the villagers shifted their gaze from my parents' legs to me with ambiguous looks. But I directly lay on the ground, crying and yelling.

"Auntie, I just couldn't accept this blow and didn't want to believe it! I wanted to see if they still had any feeling."

"I can't believe they are paralyzed. Our Chloe is still so young, hasn't been held by Mom and Dad enough."

"And, didn't I hear that my parents were injured at the construction site? But I just looked at their legs; they don't look injured at all."

"That's right, Ethan's legs indeed don't look paralyzed; they are all good meat, and I think I saw a muscle twitch just now."

The Caregiver was momentarily stunned by my sudden questioning and took a while to come up with an explanation.

"You child, do you think your parents would lie to you about being paralyzed? You hit them so hard, and they didn't react at all."

"Their legs just look fine on the outside but really can't stand up."

"Really?"

I deliberately looked at the Caregiver with skepticism. She thought she had convinced me and quickly urged me to take care of Chloe.

But I naively stood in front of her.

"My parents got so injured at the construction site. Won't the site compensate them?"

The Caregiver was stunned. My parents hadn't taught her how to cover this lie. Of course, I knew they were pretending to be crippled; I just wasn't willing to accept it. They thought they could enjoy everything, leaving all the mess to me? Dream on.

I coldly looked at the Caregiver, who knew the truth.

"Isn't the construction site willing to pay? Auntie, tell me where the site is, and I'll go find them tomorrow. If they don't pay, I'll live stream to expose them."

Cold sweat dripped down the Caregiver's forehead. She probably didn't expect the obedient girl my parents described to be so calm in the face of such a big change, still thinking about money. She had no choice but to push me back to my room to sleep, repeatedly promising to take me to the construction site tomorrow.

Even with the door closed, I could hear my parents' suppressed angry curses. My lips couldn't help but curl up.

Want to throw this mess at me without spending a penny? Not happening.

No money, no way you can dump this mess on me.

The next day, before dawn, the Caregiver knocked on my door. She handed me the "compensation" from the construction site.

"A total of ten thousand dollars, the construction site has already run. This is all I could get."

I "gratefully" accepted the ten thousand dollars.

It seems they couldn't wait to dump Logan on me; they handed over the money quite readily.

Of course, soon they could enjoy their biological daughter's fortune. Sophie Johnson is the billionaire's daughter now. She can make them happy for a lifetime with just a little bit of her wealth.

For the sake of working in the city, I had my household registration transferred out and opened a separate account. The Caregiver didn’t suspect anything.

After securing my own account, I started collecting valuable things from home.

In my previous life, when I packed up to take Chloe to the city for school, I couldn't bear to leave the vegetable garden, thinking it was their hard work.

Now, everything was leased out, with the rent in my own hands.

Mom's jewelry was also sold as needed, after all, she's in a wheelchair now and can't enjoy dressing up.

The house grew emptier, and my wallet grew fuller.

Finally, after almost emptying the house, I took my still-in-swaddling brother into the city.

Looking at my innocent brother in my arms, I sneered.

Parents, you planned for so long and dumped your brother on me. How could I let you down?

Rest assured, your daughter will present you with a grand gift.

Sixteen years passed in the blink of an eye.

Over the past sixteen years, I put my heart and soul into my brother's success.

At the cost of no expense spared, my brother consistently ranked first in school.

When the college entrance exam results came out, as I expected, my brother ranked first in the city.

As soon as the results were out, reporters camped outside my door.

Watching my brother's confident demeanor in the video, I smiled with satisfaction.

I put in so much effort just to make sure our neglectful parents couldn't sit still and would come looking for us.

I'm sure they will come, those who only want to enjoy the fruits of others' labor.

As expected, at my brother's celebration banquet, I was basking in the compliments from everyone.

The hotel door was suddenly pushed open from outside.

I stood up at the sound and saw my supposedly paralyzed parents walk in.

"How could we, your parents, not come on such an important day for our Chloe?"
The results just came out, and journalists crowded at my doorstep.

Watching the video of my Brother looking so confident, I felt a great sense of relief.

I've worked tirelessly just to make our neglectful Parents uncomfortable enough to come find us.

I'm sure they will come. They've always wanted to just sit back and enjoy the benefits.

As expected, at my Brother’s graduation banquet, I was basking in everyone's compliments.

Suddenly, the hotel door swung open from the outside.

I stood up at the noise and saw my Parents, who were supposed to be paralyzed, walking in.

"How could we not be here for such an important day for Chloe?"

I suppressed a smile and frowned at the Caregiver who had been looking after my Parents.

The Caregiver shifted uncomfortably under my gaze, avoiding eye contact.

Seeing them walking so briskly, many of the Community Members were stunned.

After all, they had been in wheelchairs for the past sixteen years.

Ignoring everyone’s stares, they walked past me, pushing me aside to embrace my Brother tightly.

My Dad lovingly patted my Brother’s head, tears streaming down his face.

"Chloe, it's Dad."

My Brother pulled away, grabbing my arm with a look of disdain.

"Sister, who is this crazy person? Why are they claiming to be my dad? I don’t have a dad like that!"

Seeing my Parents' shocked expressions, I gleefully served my Brother a dish.

My Dad, seeing his son’s disdainful look, was visibly embarrassed.

"Logan! Did you teach him this? You taught Chloe not to recognize us!"

"Otherwise, Chloe was so well-behaved as a kid. How did he end up like this?"

My Mom began to beat her chest and stomp her feet.

"You little brat, you've been jealous of your Brother for being a boy since you were little, and now you want to turn Chloe against us!"

I was speechless at their shamelessness. They hadn’t raised us for a single day, so how could we acknowledge them!

Seeing I didn't respond, my Dad, feeling provoked, moved forward to kick me.

Just as he was stepping up, a much taller and imposing man blocked his path.

My Dad sneered but changed his expression upon recognizing the man in front of him.

"Mr. Anderson, you're here too?"

"If I’m not mistaken, I didn’t notify you to come today."

The man's voice was authoritative and commanding.

My Dad’s bravado disappeared.

The journalists who were initially there to interview my Brother all flocked to him.

"Mr. Anderson, you’re number one on the wealth list again this month. Can we get an interview?"

Mr. Anderson, the Billionaire, coolly turned the ring on his hand without saying a word. The crowd gradually fell silent.

When he turned to us, his expression softened.

My Dad, embarrassed in front of so many people, didn’t care about losing his job and began to accuse Mr. Anderson.

"Mr. Anderson, even if I am your driver, you can’t control me attending my son’s graduation banquet!"

My Dad was grinning widely.

"Mr. Anderson, my Chloe is the Valedictorian here!"

Mr. Anderson chuckled at his words.

"Your Chloe?"

Hearing that, I couldn’t help but laugh too.

My Dad was too naive, thinking my Brother beside me was his Chloe.

In my past life, he didn’t care whether I lived or died. How could I continue being his scapegoat?

They still naively thought I would raise him dutifully. It’s laughable! I’ve been planning for sixteen years, waiting for this day!

Seeing my Dad’s smug face, I kindly explained to them.

"Well, actually..."

"He’s not your Chloe; he’s really just my Brother."

Hearing this, my Dad snorted.

"Chloe is our only son. How could that be wrong?"

"But you, you're not even her real Sister."
I'm sorry, it seems there is a placeholder or boundary marker instead of the actual content that needs to be translated:

"You little troublemaker, you're nothing but an unwanted child. If we hadn't taken care of you back then, you would have starved to death."
