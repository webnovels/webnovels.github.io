I was with Asher for five years, yet I wasn't even officially his girlfriend.

That night, once again, he was with me until I lost consciousness.

Half-awake, I found an engagement ring in the drawer and thought our relationship finally had a future.

I vaguely heard him on the phone with his friend Declan, "How's the proposal setup coming along?" I was thrilled.

But in the next moment, Asher sneered, "Her? She's worn out. If I weren't worried about hurting Adeline on our wedding night, she wouldn't even be in my bed."

That's when I realized I was just a stepping stone for my sister.

My mind went blank, yet I kept recalling the times with Asher.

Because he liked excitement, I had to be with him in the park, in the car, even in the cinema.

Initially, I refused, but Asher always said that after this, he'd come to my house to propose.

Until tonight, when I was drugged and accidentally discovered his true intentions.

He did plan to propose, just not to me.

I held my breath and continued eavesdropping on the call, though it was unclear.

All I heard was Asher's mocking voice, "A nanny's child can only ever serve. If Adeline wants, let her take care of us. It's not a bad deal."

I couldn't help but laugh at myself. Five years, and in the end, I'm only fit to be Asher's caregiver.

My mother was originally a nanny for the Williams Family. My father mistook her for someone else when he was drunk, and that's how I came to be.

My mother left in a hurry, but when she discovered she was pregnant, she couldn't bring herself to abort me.

After giving birth, she sent me back to the Williams Family. If my grandmother hadn't taken me in, I might have died with my mother.

Later, when my grandmother passed away, the lady of the house always gave me a hard time.

That's when Asher appeared; he'd sneak food from home for me, "Cora, eat slowly, no one's going to take it from you."

He'd also promise firmly, "I'll protect you in the future."

The call ended, and I pretended to sleep while Asher tucked me in.

I started to wonder, did he ever have any real feelings for me?

The next morning, I returned home.

That afternoon, I saw Asher dressed formally at the Williams Family's place.

He rarely dressed so formally; the suit made him look even more handsome.

Asher took out the gemstone necklace I had always wanted. Sunlight made it sparkle.

I had begged him for a long time, but he never bought it for me.

I hid behind the wall, like a mouse afraid of the light.

Asher performed a courteous bow, "Miss Williams, would you honor me as my dance partner at tomorrow night's gala?"

Adeline gave a shy smile and accepted the necklace, "Mr. Johnson, you must know, I never partner with anyone unless he's my future husband."

Nanny Taylor chimed in, "Yes, our Miss Williams is very self-respecting, unlike the second Miss who is out carousing every day."

With that, Nanny Taylor's eyes locked on me, watching from afar.

But Asher didn't spare me a glance. His voice trembled, "Adeline, if you're willing, I'll propose to you at the gala tomorrow."

I had never seen Asher this nervous.

Adeline, face full of shyness, said, "Mr. Johnson is now the heir of Johnson Corp. How could I refuse? But this isn't my decision alone. If Mr. Johnson is sincere, he should ask my father first."

I didn't understand. Before, when Adeline talked about Asher, she said, "That Asher, though young, has a stubborn streak. I prefer his uncle, who's only a few years older, with a magnetic voice and gentle nature."

But now that Asher is the heir, she's changed her tune.

Adeline looked back at me, eyes full of arrogance and pride.

I could only stand there, letting my nails dig into my palms.

When Asher left, my phone vibrated slightly. It was a message from him.

"Tonight, the usual place."

Asher wanted me to go to him again tonight.

He just said he'd propose to my sister, yet wanted to sneak around with me.

Fine, it's time to end this.

As soon as I entered, I saw Asher's robe half-open, approaching me.

"Cora, you're back."

I stepped back, looking up coldly at him.

Asher still pinned me against the wall, nails teasing my chin, "Angry?"

I turned away, "Don't touch me."

"Tomorrow's gala is important. Cora, your status isn't suitable to attend. What's wrong with inviting your sister as my dance partner?"

"Besides being a dance partner, what about the proposal? Did you think I didn't hear? Asher, what do you think of me?"

I pushed Asher with all my might, causing him to stagger.

Seeing my resistance only excited him more. He lifted my hands, pinning them to the wall.

"Cora, after all these years, you really don't know what you mean to me?"

His other hand roamed my body.

I frowned, tears falling from my eyes.

For five years, I was just Asher's tool to satisfy his desires.

Seeing me cry, Asher didn't force me further.

He released my hands, speaking gently to console me.

"Cora, I'm now the heir. Marrying your sister is more appropriate. You can still stay here; Adeline won't trouble you."

"If you find it lonely, I can give you a child."

I laughed.

He knew I was illegitimate, yet he wanted my child to be his too.

I looked at Asher with disappointment, "All these years, was it all for nothing? Have you ever loved me?"

Asher wiped my tears with his hand but said nothing.

He didn't give me an answer.

Feeling deflated, I said, "Let me go."

Asher blocked the door with his body, "Cora, recognize your status. You know how I've treated you. This is the best solution I can think of."

I pushed him away, "Recognize my status? Don't forget, you came to me first. You said you'd protect me, take care of me. Why didn't you tell me to recognize my status then?"

My words angered Asher. Usually, I would appease him, but today, he was already being patient with me.

His eyes turned cold, "Cora, I advise you to stay by my side."

But I opened the door, "Asher, let's end this."

Asher sneered, "Cora, who else would want you after I've worn you out?"

"You're just a nanny's child, daring to think you can be my wife? You're not even comparable to Adeline!"

I didn't reply, just walked out and slammed the door behind me.

Asher was furious, he opened the door and shouted, "Cora, if you have guts, don't come back!"

I returned to the home that didn't welcome me, heartbroken.

I locked myself in my room, crying softly through the night.

The next morning, there was a light knock at the door.

"Miss Cora, Mr. Williams said you should attend tonight's gala too." It was Nanny Taylor.

I didn't need to think to know it was Adeline's idea to embarrass me.

I found a dress in the closet, a gift from grandmother before she passed.

She said she wouldn't see me grow up, so this dress would witness it for her.

Now, I finally had the chance to wear it, to witness my former love's proposal.

The dress was a gentle green, making me appear more refined.

The hall was brightly lit, filled with guests.

Asher and Adeline stood in the center, a perfect couple.

Suddenly, Asher took out the engagement ring, kneeling on one knee.

"Adeline, will you marry me?"

Adeline covered her mouth, tears of joy streaming down, "Asher, I will!"

Guests applauded, congratulating them, while I stood in the shadows, expressionless.

They laughed brightly, as if I never existed.

But some busybody noticed me.

"Tsk, isn't that the second Miss Williams? I heard Mr. Williams doesn't like her. After all, she's just an illegitimate child."

"Exactly, it's Miss Williams' day. Why is she here?"

Just then, a gentle voice came.

"Come, have a drink with me."

I looked up to see Gideon, the gentle uncle Adeline mentioned, standing not far away.

He wore a well-tailored gray suit, holding a glass of red wine, looking at me with dark eyes.

Gideon smiled slightly, taking a few steps closer, "What, don't even have the courage for a drink?"

I took the champagne he offered, lightly clinking glasses.

I tilted my head back, downing the drink, feeling the burn in my throat.

Gideon's eyes flashed with admiration, "Interesting."

Adeline noticed the commotion, taking Asher's arm and walking over.

She wore a shy yet proud smile, but her eyes were full of deliberate disdain.

She looked me over, smirking, "Sister, your dress is unique. But isn't that the old dress grandmother left you? How pitiful, not even having a proper gown."

Asher stood by her side, expression cold.

Adeline clung to his arm, playfully shaking it, "Asher, don't you think so?"

Asher's eyes darkened, gently holding Adeline's hand, looking at her with warmth and affection, "Yes, Adeline is right. She doesn't belong here."
She wore a shy yet self-satisfied smile, but her eyes betrayed an unmistakable disdain.

She looked me up and down with a smirk, "Sister, your dress is quite unique. But isn't it the old dress grandmother left you before she passed away? How unfortunate that you can't even afford a proper gown."

Asher stood beside her, his expression indifferent.

Adeline clung to his arm and shook it affectionately, "Asher, don't you think so?"

Asher's eyes darkened a little as he gently took Adeline's hand, his gaze tender and deep. "Yes, Adeline is right. She doesn't belong here."

I gripped my champagne glass tightly, my fingers trembling slightly.

Adeline continued, "Today is a wonderful day. It's dull to be alone. Why not have Asher find someone to keep you company?"

As soon as she finished speaking, someone nearby chimed in, "I'll pay a hundred thousand for a night with Miss Cora!"

Adeline pretended to restrain them, "What are you doing? She's my sister!"

"I'll pay two hundred thousand!"

"Three hundred thousand!"

The bids grew louder, yet there wasn't a flicker of emotion in Asher's eyes.

Gideon stood at a distance, holding a champagne glass, watching the spectacle.

It wasn't until an elderly man with a white beard shouted a million that my father stepped in to stop the charade.

"If you're interested in my daughter, why don't we arrange an engagement between our families?"

My eyes filled with tears as I glanced at Asher.

He still stood by Adeline, gently arranging her hair, as if none of this concerned him.

"Dad!" I stepped forward, my voice so hoarse it was barely audible. "I'm not an object to be auctioned off!"

My father snorted coldly, his eyes filled with disdain. "You still have the nerve to speak? Your mother climbed into bed for money! Now you're just a cheap thing. If someone bids, shouldn't you hurry over to serve them?"

The hall erupted in laughter, and my face turned pale, almost unable to stand.

My father set my wedding date for three days later.

Suddenly, I became the laughingstock of the party.

I took advantage of the distraction to hide in the tree outside the mansion.

As a child, to avoid being beaten, I would climb the tree, ignoring Mrs. Williams' shouts from below.

"You brat! Get down here and take your beating!"

I also met Asher from next door while in that tree.

He told me to jump into his yard, promising to catch me so I wouldn't get hurt.

But now I heard a familiar voice.

It was Adeline and a waiter from the party.

The waiter scratched his head. "Miss Williams, you agreed to Mr. Gideon's proposal today. Should we still use Uncle Gideon's drug?"

Adeline replied smugly, "Of course. Gideon's overseas business is much more lucrative than the Johnson Corp's. Who wouldn't want to marry someone wealthier?"

Hearing this, an idea suddenly struck me.

If I went with Gideon, I wouldn't have to be with that white-bearded old man, right?

Recalling Gideon's face, his sharp eyebrows, bright eyes, high nose bridge, and defined jawline, perhaps the alcohol was taking effect, and I felt my cheeks warm.

I had to admit, the Johnson family produces handsome men. Gideon seemed even more attractive than Asher.

I heard Gideon was involved in the gray market business overseas, so he might have influence domestically too.

Surely he could protect me.

I didn't want to become the plaything of that old man.

Without delay, I changed into a waiter's outfit and slipped back into the party.

I saw Gideon swaying slightly, with Adeline quietly trailing behind.

Asher suddenly blocked Adeline. "Adeline, you accepted my proposal today. Isn't it time for us to share a dance?"

Adeline glanced in Gideon's direction but still agreed to dance with Asher.

Asher held Adeline's waist, and they started dancing to the song I used to dance with him most often.

No one looked my way, so I followed Gideon into a room.

As the door clicked shut, Gideon seemed to regain some clarity.

The room was dark. He stared at me. "Who are you? Dare to follow me? Do you have a death wish?"

Standing by the door, my palms were sweaty.

When I didn’t respond, he abruptly turned on a lamp.

Seeing my face, he smiled slightly. "It's you."

He smirked, mockery in his eyes. "So eager to get into my bed?"

I bit my lower lip, forcing myself to stay calm. "Gideon, I need your help."

His fingers slowly traced my collarbone, his voice low and tempting. "Tell me, why should I help you?"

I lowered my gaze, struggling to suppress my humiliation, clenching my fists tightly. "If you agree to help me, I'm willing to be your woman."

Gideon leaned closer to my ear. "I've been waiting for you, but there's no need to rush."

Perhaps it was the effect of the drug; he kissed me passionately.

Suddenly, there was the sound of a door opening. He looked towards the entrance, raising his gaze. "Get out!"

My back was to the door, but I guessed it was Adeline.

After a moment of intimacy, Gideon held me in his arms. "So, tell me, how do I compare to Asher?"

My face flushed red. "Uncle, you're still as strong as ever."

Gideon chuckled softly at this. "Uncle? Do you think I'm old?"

I closed my eyes, unable to meet his gaze. "Then what should I call you?"

"Call me Gideon."

I took a deep breath and met his gaze. "Gideon."

Gideon traced my earlobe with his thumb, whispering, "You're finally mine. I've waited so long for this day."

I was stunned. What did he mean by that?

Gideon let out a soft laugh, "Remember when you climbed that tree? I asked Asher to call you down because I had something urgent that day and needed him to look after you."
