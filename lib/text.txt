Terminal Cancer, Husband Falls for His Young, Juicy Secretary

I return home after chemotherapy to find my husband in our marital bed with his secretary, their bodies intertwined in passion.

Seeing me, the secretary giggles coyly: "Oh sis, don't be angry. I'm just helping take some of the burden off you, since I was worried it might be too much for you to handle."

My husband casually lights a post-coital cigarette:

"You never let me touch you anymore. You're as cold as a dead fish in bed!"

"I've been so pent up I'm about to lose it. Amber here has been working overtime to help you out. From now on, give her half your allowance!"

On the verge of death, I cough up blood in shock.

The secretary laughs at me, saying I must have bought fake blood to make such an unconvincing performance.

My husband is embarrassed by me and ignores my unconscious state.

He takes his secretary to a 5-star hotel to reignite their passion.

But later, when he receives my critical condition notice, he goes mad.

1

My husband is away on a business trip, so I have to go to the hospital alone.

Seeing the word "cancer" on the diagnosis report, I'm struck as if by lightning.

If I die, how will my husband who loves me so deeply go on living?

I drag my heavy feet home. As soon as I open the door, I smell an intimate scent in the air.

My already heavy heart sinks even further.

The bedroom door is wide open. A man's low growls and a woman's gasps shamelessly rise and fall.

Ryan's secretary Amber clings to him like a vine, her face flushed red.

Her exposed skin is white and tender, smooth as satin.

Ryan's muscular back is covered in red scratches, as he passionately grips the woman's soft curves.

Amber's long hair is spread out like seaweed on our custom-made bed.

This bed was my late father's wedding gift to me, the only one of its kind in the world.

Yet Ryan has brought another woman to do unspeakable things on our marital bed.

Their intimate sounds threaten to pierce my eardrums, my very soul trembling.

"Oh Ryan, you're so bad, not being gentle with me at all."

"Hmm? How else could I satisfy an insatiable little vixen like you?"

Ryan is lost in passion, their bodies tightly joined. He hasn't noticed me at the door at all.

I think I must have been delusional. Even if I died right now, he probably wouldn't care at all.

Amber peeks out from under Ryan and glances at me with a coy smile.

"Darling, this is your marriage bed. Won't your wife be upset if she finds out?"

Ryan brushes his hand over Amber's red lips, leaving a suggestive trail in the sunlight.

"What does she have to be upset about? Being my lawful wife is a blessing few women could hope for in several lifetimes!"

"She may be a competent wife, but she's as stiff as a board in bed. Only a seductive little minx like you can truly excite me!"

Amber shoots me a challenging look, then rakes her nails down Ryan's back again:

"You're so bad! What am I to you? You're my first and only man!"

"Alright, alright. I'll buy you that lakeside villa tomorrow as a gift!"

Amber lets out an incredulous gasp:

"Really, darling? But that villa costs at least $5 million. I'm afraid your wife won't agree."

Ryan laughs dismissively: "So what if she finds out? She loves me so much she'd never leave me!"

Amber turns away from me and clings tightly to the oblivious Ryan.

My chest aches, a metallic taste rising in my mouth.

I stumble, nearly falling to the ground.

The noise I make interrupts their passionate moment.

Ryan moves quickly, pulling the large red comforter over to wrap Amber up tightly.

My stomach churns. I have to grip the doorframe to stay standing:

"What's this? You're shameless enough to have sex in broad daylight, but too afraid to be seen naked?"

"How did you sneak in like a ghost without making any sound? Barging in like this, don't you know to respect others' privacy?"

Secure in his favoritism, Amber shrinks behind him, her face unable to hide her smugness.

"Sis, Ryan was feeling unwell from the heat today. I was just helping him feel better with a massage. Please don't misunderstand."

She coyly stretches out her delicate hands towards me: "People with heatstroke need to stay cool, so we're a bit underdressed. But Ryan's feeling much better now..."

"Look how swollen my hands are from working so hard... I only had good intentions, please don't be angry at Ryan!"

I don't respond.

Ryan's brow furrows, his voice icy:

"Weren't you supposed to be at the hospital? Why are you back so soon?"

It feels like every bone in my body has been crushed by a massive weight, crumbling to dust.

I shake my head, hardly able to believe my ears. Has the world gone mad?

How could the man who once loved me more than life itself speak such cruel words to me?

Tears fall uncontrollably, blurring my vision.

I use all my strength to barely choke out: "Ryan, we promised to love only each other for life!"

Ryan impatiently waves his hand:

"Love is love, sex is sex. Don't confuse the two. Amber is sacrificing herself to help take your burden with no recognition. She hasn't complained, yet you're the one feeling wronged!"

"Wake up! We've been together for 10 years since we were 18. Would you still wear clothes you've had for 10 years? Everyone in our circle has lovers on the side. Why should I have to repress myself and suffer with an old, frigid fish like you?"

I look at my reflection on the floor, my heart turning cold.

It's true, I'm already 28 years old. And a 28-year-old with terminal cancer at that.

Since starting chemo, my hair keeps falling out. The harsh side effects have left me gaunt and sallow.

I lie awake night after night in agony, tearing holes in the sheets from gripping them so tightly.

I really do look like an old, worn-out piece of clothing now.

I've changed so drastically, yet Ryan comes and goes without noticing, as if he's gone blind.

Later, medication made me swell up all over. I looked like I'd gained a ton of weight.

His gaze finally changed from indifference to disgust.

I had thought that I was letting him down by having an uncooperative body that couldn't accompany him through life as promised.

I endured the torture of illness, pretending not to notice his change in attitude.

But how could he compare me, with my numbered days, to a worn-out piece of clothing unfit to be seen?

I shouldn't have tied my short life to such a rotten cucumber.

"Ryan, let's get divorced."

Ryan's mocking expression freezes in place. He sneers contemptuously:

"Divorce? Where would a useless old hag like you go? Who else would pamper you like I do?"

"Just be a good Mrs. Zhou and you'll never go hungry..."

Seeing my tears fall rapidly, Ryan's tone softens slightly.

"Be a good girl and listen to me. I promise I'll never abandon you in this lifetime!"

Amber pinches his waist in displeasure:

"What about me? Will you toss me aside when you're bored?"

Ryan grins wickedly and pushes Amber's head down:

"Afraid I'll get tired of you? Then you'd better learn some new tricks to keep me satisfied, you little minx!"

These two shameless dogs are so brazen right in front of me. They're not just disrespecting me as Ryan's wife, they're not even treating me as a human being.

I can no longer control myself. A mouthful of blood sprays out.

The bright red blood is shocking, splattering everywhere. Even Amber, hiding behind Ryan, isn't spared.

Her previously flawless makeup is now a mess, transforming from a beauty to a hag in an instant.

She's furious, her affected cutesy voice cracking:

"You disgusting old woman, how revolting!"

Anger flares in my chest. I lunge forward and grab her hair, yanking hard:

"You little slut, get off my bed right now!"

She effortlessly pushes me to the ground:

"Ryan, I'm so upset! It took me hours to do my makeup and now it's ruined. You have to get justice for me!"

Ryan gently wipes Amber's face with a wet wipe from the bedside table, not forgetting to turn back and warn me.

"Olivia, stop acting like a shrew!"

What little life force I had left is not enough to withstand such a vicious attack.

My broken body collapses helplessly to the floor. I want to get up but have no strength, only able to struggle weakly on the ground.

But Ryan pays me no mind, allowing Amber to mock me freely.

"Ryan, it's such a waste of talent that your wife isn't an actress. Look how convincingly she's faking coughing up blood!"

"Even her half-dead look after spitting blood is flawless. Who knows how many times she's rehearsed in private! What a terrifying jealousy!"

My heart aches. I want to cry but have no tears left. I try to call out but my parched throat makes no sound.

It feels like a million steel needles are churning in my brain. My soul is instantly riddled with holes.

My vision darkens. The air seems to be thinning.

I'm struck with fear...

With my last shred of hope, I look pleadingly at Ryan, my lips moving weakly:

"Husband, save me."

"Quickly, take me to the hospital..."

A flicker of guilt flashes in Ryan's eyes as he pulls away from Amber's clinging arms.

"Don't worry, honey. I'll take you to the doctor right away."

But Amber refuses to let go, pressing herself against him again:

"Don't go, Ryan. I'm so cold, hold me! She's clearly acting, don't believe her!"

Ryan roughly yanks Amber's arm off him, tossing her onto the bed:

"Get off me! Don't tell me what to do! If anything happens to my wife, you'll be in big trouble!"

Amber doesn't give up. She switches to an even more alluring pose, showcasing her body's softness to the fullest. Her tone is seductive:

"Ryan, can't you smell it? That's clearly chicken blood!"

"How could a healthy person cough up so much blood? Look how lively your wife seems. She must have held the blood in her mouth beforehand!"

Ryan's expression turns doubtful. His steps towards me come to a halt.

"She's even using the 'playing dead' trick to compete for attention. Look, she's even put on 'seriously ill' makeup!"
"Not content with being the first wife, she's getting a bit greedy..."

Ryan's body, which had tensed up from nervousness, completely relaxes. He stands in place, carelessly looking me over.

After a long moment, his face twists with intense disgust. He picks up the trash can by the bed and dumps its contents over my face.

"You want to compete for attention? Then open your eyes wide and see clearly who can truly bring out the joy of being a man!"

"The stuff at home that was about to expire - Amber and I used it all up this afternoon!"

"Please... you... hospital..." I beg.

He can't be bothered to look at me as I struggle on the brink of death, pleading desperately. He flips the trash can over my head, his tone ice-cold.

"Give it up. Stop acting. You've been exposed. There's no point in continuing this performance!"

"Amber understands you lonely, bitter old women best!"

Amber, feeling validated, cheers excitedly in her coquettish voice:

"Of course I do! I've watched so many palace dramas, I know all about these troublemaking old women!"

With the heavy trash can over my head, I can barely breathe. I bite my tongue to maintain my last shred of clarity:

"Save me, I'm really dying. Call 911..."

Amber lets out a shrill scream.

"I know this one! The next act is 'diagnosed with terminal illness'!"

"Tsk tsk, sis, where did you take your acting classes? That tuition was well spent!"

"But have you considered how much money Ryan could be losing? He makes millions in deals every minute. You're being so inconsiderate!"

The stench of the couple's lovemaking from inside the trash can assaults my senses, jolting me awake.

It's better to rely on myself than others.

Using my last ounce of strength, I shake off the trash can and crawl towards the door on trembling hands.

The security guards patrol regularly. If I can just get outside, I have a chance of being rescued.

Behind me, Amber's mocking voice rings out loudly.

"Ryan, your wife is really going all out. She's really selling this 'struggle for life' act."

"It's a shame about this fine hardwood floor though. She's making such a mess, it'll definitely leave marks."

My whole body is shaking, every cell trembling. Tears and sweat mingle, stinging my eyes fiercely.

I ignore Amber's sarcasm and finally reach the door.

With great effort, I raise my hand to reach for the doorknob. Again and again I try, I don't know how many times, until I finally grasp it.

But the door doesn't open. Ryan violently swats my hand away.

"If your brain's not working right, hurry up and go see a doctor. No one has time to watch you act out this sob story!"

It feels like millions of insects are gnawing at my body. I clench my fists tightly, my palms bleeding.

"I'm really sick, I feel terrible. Let me go to the hospital myself, I promise I won't bother you!"

The immense psychological trauma combined with extreme pain makes me feel like I'm seeing two figures, one black and one white.

No, I can't die now. I still have so many unfulfilled wishes.

In this desperate situation, I can only play along, swallowing my pride and begging:

"Please open the door. I'll go to the hospital myself, I really won't cause you any trouble..."

Ryan looks at the blood smeared on his calf with disgust and kicks me hard.

I've completely lost all my strength. I can only lie on the cold floor, feeling my heartbeat grow weaker and weaker.

Ryan grabs my hair and drags me towards the door without a care.
