Asher's grandmother left a wish before she passed, hoping Asher would marry me. So even though he fell in love with his Thea, Asher insisted on marrying me. It wasn't until Thea killed the puppy I had raised since childhood that Asher chose to protect Thea again. This time, I didn't argue. Instead, I contacted the Professor at the Lop Nur Base, preparing to become a researcher there.

Before I left, I gave myself seven days to wrap things up. On the first day, I took off the engagement ring symbolizing "the only one." On the third day, I submitted my resignation at the company. On the day I was leaving, Asher suddenly remembered the puppy and promised to accompany me to buy a new one tomorrow. Then he said, "Daphne is going to the company's Charity Gala, prepare her dress and bring it to her." I agreed with a smile and disappeared from his world forever.

Later, whenever Asher heard about me, he would stare at our engagement ring in a daze. That was the lover he couldn't win back and the puppy he couldn't replace...

Looking at the NDA in my hand, I signed my name without hesitation. "Professor, I am willing to join the Rocket Development Program." The Professor looked at me with some regret. "You should know this task is top secret. Once you join, you will have to remain anonymous for ten years. No one will be able to find you."

"Aren't you getting married? At least discuss it with your partner." Thinking of Asher's cold and resolute face, I smiled bitterly and shook my head. "No need."

The Professor was silent for a moment, then spoke, "Alright, go get ready. We leave in seven days." It was raining as I left the Professor's office, and I walked home in the rain. Unsurprisingly, Asher still hadn't come back.

Daphne had taken away Buddy, the dog I had raised since childhood. When I tried to reason with Asher, he blamed me instead, and then he didn't come home for three days. I took off the ring on my hand and threw it into the drawer. It was a ring Asher made for me by hand, symbolizing our lifelong love, meant never to be removed, even in death.

I naively thought we would grow old together. But everything changed when Daphne returned from abroad. Asher no longer remembered my birthday or cared about my feelings. I became the most invisible person in the house.

I was about to take off my soaked clothes when the door sounded. Opening it, I saw Daphne with a spiteful look, disdainfully kicking something at her feet. "This beast wouldn't listen and got hit by a car."

I looked in disbelief at Buddy's small body lying there, his fur soaked with mud and blood. My heart twisted painfully, and my eyes instantly filled with tears. Seeing this, Daphne's sneer deepened, shrugging indifferently. "It's just a dog. Do you have to cry like your mother died?"

I couldn't hold back anymore and pushed Daphne hard. She screamed and fell into Asher's arms, who had rushed over when he heard the noise. Instantly, she was in tears, "Asher, the dog ran out and got hit by a car on its own. Why blame me?"

Before I could speak, she cried even harder, "I'm sorry, Cora, I didn't mean to..." Touching Buddy's lifeless body, my heart ached to the point of suffocation, and I couldn't help but shout at her, "What's the use of saying sorry!"

She immediately acted as if she had been greatly wronged. "Asher, I kindly brought over the dog's body, and she talks to me like this..." Asher looked at me with increasing impatience, "It's just an animal. It's dead, so what? My grandma left you so much money, don't you know how many dogs you can buy with it?"

With someone defending her, Daphne cried even harder, soaking a large patch of Asher's chest with her tears. Perhaps thinking it wasn't enough, he continued, "Cora, when did you become so petty and unreasonable?"

Animal? I looked at him, almost unable to breathe from the pain. He knew how important Buddy was to me. It was the only gift my mother left me before she died. He had once promised at my mother's bedside to take care of me and Buddy. But now, for Daphne, he called Buddy an animal.

It turns out Asher's heart had strayed too far. I was also tired and didn't want to fight anymore. Thinking of my decision to leave, I felt relieved. Asher gently patted Daphne's back and glared at me, "Are you satisfied now?" Then, he gently patted Daphne's head, affectionately saying, "It's raining outside. Shall I take you home?"

Daphne snuggled into his arms, giving me a challenging smile from an angle he couldn't see. Watching his hurried steps, I gave a bitter smile. The Asher who once claimed to have fallen in love with me at first sight and pursued me passionately never truly loved me. I was just a distraction in his loneliness, and Daphne was his true love. Now the rightful owner was back, and I, the substitute, should step down.

But it didn't matter anymore. I hid the ring and the unsigned prenuptial agreement in the drawer. Asher would never know that the agreement his grandmother forced him to sign, granting me half of his assets, was never notarized, nor did I sign it.

Chapter 2

After cremating Buddy, I buried him next to my mother's grave. On the third morning, the Professor sent me the exact departure time. I replied with an "okay" and then walked into the HR office. I formally submitted my resignation. They must have disliked me for a long time, as the process went smoothly.

Just as I closed the door of the HR office, I heard them gossiping. "She just up and resigned. Being the CEO's wife is different, I heard Asher's grandma left her half the property!" "What CEO's wife? It's not even official. I think she resigned because Asher gave her project to Miss Daphne." "Wasn't that the project she was working on? It's almost finished. Giving it to Miss Daphne now is like letting her reap the rewards." "So what? Miss Daphne is Asher's true love."

It's not surprising they thought that way. As soon as Daphne returned, Asher gave her the General Manager position. Even if Daphne knew nothing, Asher would hand the project to her himself. He even had me work overtime to revise Daphne's proposals and entertain her clients. Even when I ended up hospitalized with a bleeding stomach, he said I owed it to Daphne.

Listening to the occasional mocking laughter, I felt no waves in my heart. I just hoped the coming days would pass quickly. With everything settled, it was time for me to pack up.

I returned home with my things, only to see Asher and Daphne having breakfast together, laughing and chatting. Watching them feed each other, my hands started to tremble. Once, I mistakenly used Asher's cup, and he hired a dozen cleaners to sanitize the house, warning me not to have physical contact with him.

Turns out Asher didn't have a cleanliness obsession. He just didn't want to be intimate with me. Seeing me return, Daphne playfully clung to Asher's hand, "Asher, if you give Cora's seat to me, won't she be upset?" Asher sneered, "I'm the company's CEO. Do I need her approval for my decisions?"

"But Cora hasn't been home for days." "She's waiting for me to coax her. Don't mind her." Hearing this, Daphne's eyes were full of triumphant pride. She leaned into Asher's embrace, wrapping her arms around his neck coquettishly.

I said nothing and headed upstairs. That's when Asher noticed me. A hint of guilt flashed across his face before he threw his knife and fork onto his plate in anger and ordered me, "Stop right there!"

I kept walking, but he rushed over and grabbed my arm. "Cora, what's your problem? Do you even remember you have a home?" He reached to take the box from my arms, but I turned away. "No need, you go ahead with your work."

Asher looked even more impatient, about to say something when Daphne called him, "Asher, I want another fried egg. Can you make one for me?" "Sure," Asher replied and headed to the kitchen.

I stepped forward to go back to my room, but Daphne blocked my way. "What do you want?" Daphne glanced toward the kitchen, and her gentle facade faded, revealing jealousy and resentment. "Cora, you heard it all, didn't you? Asher only has me in his heart. If it weren't for his grandmother forcing him, he wouldn't marry you."

"I heard his grandma left you half the property. Don't delude yourself into thinking any of it is yours!" "I advise you to be sensible and hand over the property agreement. After all, just one word from me, and he would kick you out."

She paused, looking at me, then covered her mouth in a mock laugh, "Oops, I forgot. All your family is dead. You're like a stray dog no one wants." "No wonder you cling to Asher like a leech."

Her tone was contemptuous, her eyes filled with mockery. No matter how she insulted me, I didn't care. But she shouldn't have mocked my family. In an instant, my blood froze, and I couldn't help but yell at her, "Daphne, say one more word, and I'll tear your mouth apart!"

"Asher! What are you doing!?"
She paused, looked at me, then covered her mouth in a mocking laugh. "Oops, I forgot. Your whole family's gone now. You're just like an unwanted stray."

"No wonder you're stuck to Asher like glue."

Her voice dripped with disdain, her eyes gleaming with amusement.

I could endure any insult she hurled at me, but mocking my family was crossing the line. My blood ran cold, and I couldn't help but shout, "Daphne! Say one more word and I'll make you regret it!"

"Cora! What's gotten into you?!"

Asher happened to overhear, worried I might harm Daphne, and immediately intervened.

I paused, noticing Daphne's raised eyebrow as she subtly pushed me.

The next second, I lost my balance and tumbled down the stairs. Pain shot through me as I hit the ground.

"Cora!" Asher dropped everything and rushed over to help me up.

Daphne leaned toward Asher, tears brimming in her eyes, "Asher, I didn't mean to... It's all my fault for being so clumsy and causing trouble. What should I do now..."

Her panic seemed perfectly genuine, and Asher couldn't bring himself to blame her.

He frowned, looking at me, "Are you okay? Do you need to go to the hospital? Daphne didn't mean it, don't hold it against her."

I shook my head, bitterness seeping in as I looked away, noticing the scattered items.

The resignation letter and confidential documents were right on top.

Chapter 3

Afraid he might notice, I ignored the pain and hurried to gather them.

"I'll do it." Asher crouched down, picking up the resignation letter with a frown.

I held my breath, hoping he wouldn't notice the confidential documents.

Luckily, Asher's attention was on the resignation letter, allowing me to hide the documents among other items.

"You quit?" Asher sounded surprised.

"Yeah." I shoved everything into the box.

He sounded displeased, "Why didn't you say so earlier? Before, when I asked you to hand over the project, you refused. Why the change of heart now?"

Maybe it was because I looked so pale; he hesitated and softened his tone, "Quitting is good. Saves me some effort. Grandma gave you so much money, you should be content."

"You should focus on being Mrs. Asher and stop competing with Daphne."

"She's kind-hearted and doesn't understand your scheming."

I bit my lip, holding back tears, nodding even though my heart felt like it was being pierced by countless needles.

I struggled to stand despite the pain. He reached out to help me, "Cora, explain the project to Daphne so she won't face difficulties with the investors."

"She's not like you, able to charm people and even get half the property."

Not wanting to waste more time on them, I nodded to Asher, "Okay."

Asher seemed pleased with my compliance, smiling at me, "That's better. Sorry for neglecting you lately. Once Daphne fully takes over your work, I'll make it up to you."

"After the mourning period for Grandma, we can get married. It'll give her peace."

I bit my lip hard, my heart aching. That day would never come.

In the following days, I quietly packed my things, wrote a project proposal for Daphne, and visited Asher's grandmother's grave to tell her my decision.

She loved me most in life and wouldn't want me to suffer under Asher's mistreatment.

On the last day, Asher stayed home.

I felt anxious, trying to find reasons to leave smoothly.

Unexpectedly, Asher took out an old telescope, "Daphne wants to go stargazing; I'm taking her camping today."

"Alright." I sighed in relief. Leaving early would let me avoid running into him.

He added, "There's a Charity Gala tonight. Get a dress ready for Daphne."

I thought for a moment. By then, I'd be on the way to my new life.

Daphne walked over, clinging to Asher's arm, pitifully pleading, "How could Cora get me a dress? Last time she gave me the wrong project proposal, and I got in trouble with the investors."

"Asher, I can wear anything. I don't want to..."

She even shed a few tears, and Asher glared at me angrily, "Cora, if you don't want to do it, just say so. How could you do this? You've really disappointed me!"

I was about to leave and didn't want any more conflict. I calmly apologized to Daphne, "Sorry, my bad. It won't happen again."

Then I looked at Asher, "Don't worry, I'll prepare the dress for her."

A hint of guilt flashed across Asher's face. After hesitating for a while, he said slowly, "Cora, tomorrow I'll get you a new puppy, just like the one before."

Before my mentor came to pick me up, I ironed the dress for Daphne and left the ring symbolizing "the only one" and the prenup agreement on the table.

With my suitcase in hand, I headed downstairs. The Professor looked at my expressionless face and sighed helplessly.

"Since you've decided to go, work hard over there and achieve results soon!"

"Okay!"

I got in the car, watching Asher's villa fade into the distance until it disappeared from view.

In the early morning, Asher returned home, slightly tipsy, with Daphne.

The house was silent, with no lights on. Asher was instinctively displeased.

After all, no matter how late it was, I would always wait for him on the sofa.

"Cora! Come out and make some hangover soup."

But the empty house remained silent, with no response.

Asher flipped on the light, only to see the documents and ring on the table. He immediately yelled, "Cora! Who allowed you to take off the ring?!"
