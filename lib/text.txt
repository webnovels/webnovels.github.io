Husband Went Mad After Refusing to Defuse Bomb

Chapter 1
My husband's mother had been out in the fields when she accidentally stepped on an old landmine from the battlefield.
The community police asked me to find my retired husband, who was a bomb disposal expert, to defuse it, but I shook my head and refused.
In my past life, I ran 6 miles to town to save her, dragging my husband, who was on a date with his first love, out of the restaurant, begging him to save her.
She was safely rescued, but his first love was dragged into an alley by her ex-husband and beaten to death.
My husband praised me for what I had done in front of others, but on the anniversary of his first love's death, he used the very landmine he had unearthed to blow me to pieces.
"Why wasn't it you who died? Go to hell and apologize to Sarah!"
This time, my husband finally had a pleasant dinner with his first love.
But when he learned what had happened at home, he was driven mad with regret.

"Mia, don't come any closer, stay away from me!"
Hearing the familiar voice, I suddenly opened my eyes.
Standing before me, my husband's mother, Ella Clark, was crying but still insisted on pushing me away.
"I'm getting on in years, and I'm not as nimble as I used to be. If this landmine goes off, I don't want to drag any of you into it."
Upon hearing this, the police quickly pulled me back.
"Mia, isn't your husband a retired bomb disposal expert? Where is he? Get him here quickly!"
Hearing the repeated urgings, I tightly clenched my hands, barely holding back tears.
"He went to the town with Sarah. If I go get him, he probably won't come back..."
The neighbors who had followed the police came to a halt upon hearing this, all looking awkwardly at each other.
The affair between my husband, Samuel Clark, and Sarah Harris had already caused a huge scandal in town.
Today was our wedding anniversary, yet he took all the money from home, saying he needed to buy Sarah some skincare and take her to the fanciest restaurant for dinner.
The atmosphere around me was heavy. A young neighbor, seeing my troubled expression, sighed, "Mia, don't worry. We're quick. We'll find him and bring him back!
"Take care of his mother, and leave it to us!"
Without waiting for the police to speak, the group of neighbors dashed off. I lowered my gaze, finally accepting the truth of my rebirth.
Of course, Ella was aware of the disgraceful things her son had done and looked at me with a face full of worry.
"Mia, Samuel's actions are my fault. I didn't educate him properly. I'm so sorry for you.
"When he comes back, I'll make him sever all ties with that little slut!"
My throat tightened with sorrow, and I couldn't hold back the tears.
Even though Sarah had dumped Samuel twice, he still wanted to drag me down with her over a made-up accusation.
"How could such a man ever sever ties with Sarah?" I thought.
Just as we comforted and encouraged each other, the neighbors, covered in sweat, came running back.
Everyone's eyes turned toward them.
But behind them was nothing.
Samuel hadn't come.
Breathless and furious, the neighbors finally spoke up.
"Samuel seems to be out of his mind, shopping for skincare and clothes with that shameless Sarah at the mall!"
"We tried everything to get him to listen, but the bastard just wouldn't believe us!"
"Do you know what he said? He said we were sent by Mia to try to trick him into coming back, claiming Mia wanted to save money for herself and was lying to him!"
"How can there be such a son in the world? His mother stepped on a landmine, and even if he has doubts, he should come back immediately to check on her!"
"And that Sarah, what a piece of work! She had the nerve to make us out to be Mia's lovers with just a few words. It's maddening! How can someone be so shameless?"
Chapter 2
After venting their frustrations without holding back, the neighbors suddenly remembered that Samuel's mother was standing right in front of them.
Tears streamed down Ella's face, her eyes clouded with sorrow. Her lips trembled for a long moment before she barely managed to speak, "Did that ungrateful man really say that?
"Mia, in this life, I owe you an apology. I've ruined your life. I'm useless, but I'll use this life to make it up to you."
She was so overwhelmed by the shock that she was on the verge of breaking down.
Under the heavy silence of the onlookers, I gritted my teeth and said, "Ella, this isn't your fault. It's Samuel. He's lost his way. I've never blamed you!
"If it weren't for you feeding me when I was little, I'd have starved to death long ago. I don't want you to apologize. I want you to live a good life!"
When I was very young, my parents died in a flood.
I was alone. It was Ella who adopted me, giving me food and raising me until I grew up safely.
Years ago, Samuel was in a relationship with Sarah. But Sarah, dissatisfied with Samuel being just a bomb disposal soldier with no future, left him a letter and ran off with a wealthy man from the town.
Since then, Samuel was deeply hurt and turned to me for comfort.
Ella had always liked me for being hardworking and capable, urging me to agree to marry him. I married Samuel with gratitude in my heart, but then Sarah returned.
Samuel wanted a divorce, but Ella firmly opposed it. The whole town was talking about it.
With Sarah's instigation, Samuel believed it was me who was causing trouble, and he hated me for it. To get back at me, he and Sarah would go to town every day, eating and drinking without care, wasting money recklessly.
My emotions were in turmoil, but I forced myself to comfort Ella.
Seeing she finally calmed down, I reached out and took her rough, weathered hand.
"Ella, your health isn't good. You won't last much longer.
"Let me switch places with you, okay?"
As soon as those words left my mouth, the crowd that had come to help erupted in protest.
"Mia, think this through. This is a landmine left from the battlefield. If something goes wrong, even if you survive, you'll be left crippled. Your whole future will be ruined!"
"You're so young, and you can read. Don't risk your future like this!"
Ella's tears wouldn't stop.
"Mia, I raised you, but it's only because your parents saved me from the flood all those years ago!
"I'm old, and if I die, so be it. Don't make things worse!"
I held onto her hand, refusing to let go.
"I can't just watch you die. If you won't switch, I'm not going anywhere. We'll both be blown to pieces together!"
After my pleading and threats, Ella finally agreed to switch places.
The community police, seeing they couldn't convince me, moved back with the crowd for safety's sake.
Back when Samuel and I were close, he'd once told me about how a teammate in his unit had to replace someone who stepped on a landmine. I carefully taught Ella the steps, moving my foot gingerly.
It wasn't easy. My legs felt like they were going to give out.
But now, I was beyond caring. The only person who had ever been kind to me was Ella, and I couldn't bear to watch her get hurt.
After a long, painful silence, Ella and I successfully swapped places.
She wiped her tears and looked at me, stamping her foot in frustration.
"Mia, wait here. I will personally go and get that bastard back!"
Seeing that I had actually swapped with Ella, the neighbors' eyes were filled with admiration.
The neighbors who had just caught their breath now spoke up again.
"We'll take you there. You need to teach Samuel a lesson. He's gone way too far!"
The group quickly helped Ella down the road, disappearing from sight.
I stood in silence with the community police, waiting for what felt like an eternity before they finally came back.
Chapter 3
However, just like last time, they still hadn't brought Samuel back.
As soon as Ella saw me, her legs gave way, and she collapsed onto the ground.
"Mia, I'm so sorry. That ungrateful man, he has no humanity!"
Seeing Ella cry so uncontrollably, the neighbors couldn't hold back their anger.
"Samuel's gone mad! He doesn't even trust his own mother!"
Hearing their angry complaints, I barely pieced together what had happened in town earlier.
Apparently, after buying the skincare and clothes, they had gone to a restaurant.
As the neighbors arrived, they were feeding each other and exchanging sweet nothings.
Seeing Ella, Samuel immediately threw down his fork.
"Mom, can you stop following Mia's crazy antics? She sent someone to say you stepped on a landmine. If you really stepped on a landmine, how could you have walked all the way to town like this?
"I just wanted to have a meal with Sarah. Can't you leave me alone?"
Ella was furious. She flipped the table and tried to drag Samuel back.
Seeing Ella's expression, which seemed genuine, Samuel finally started to believe a little.
But just as he was about to leave, Sarah grabbed his other hand.
"I know Mia doesn't like me, can't stand how Samuel is always with me, but Mrs. Clark, you can't joke about things like this.
"The battlefield's been cleared so many times, how could there still be landmines?"
As a result, no matter how much Ella swore and pleaded, Samuel wouldn't believe her.
Ella, enraged, tried to strike Sarah, but Samuel blocked her and walked away without sparing her a glance.
Hearing this, the police's face turned pale.
At that moment, my hope was completely shattered.
Our village was remote, and only Samuel had the skills to defuse bombs.
If he didn't come, I had no way out.
I stood from dawn until dusk, and Ella fainted from crying several times, only to be forced back home by the neighbors to rest.
In the middle of the night, I could barely feel my legs anymore.
My body felt numb and heavy, and I knew I couldn't hold on any longer.
With tears in their eyes, the neighbors looked at me as I spoke in a hoarse voice, "Please, get me some paper. I want to write a farewell letter."
The police, fighting back tears, sent someone to get it, and my neighbors rushed off, also crying.
Just then, a row of torches suddenly lit up in the distance.
"Is this where the landmine was found? We're a trained team, and we've brought in a bomb disposal expert!"
Everyone rushed to greet them. I felt as though I had been given a second chance at life. My body went weak, and I nearly fell to the ground.
The neighbors, concerned for my safety, rushed up from either side to support me.
"Mia, hang in there. Who cares if that idiot Samuel won't come, there is someone here who will save you!"
"Mia, you're kind and beautiful. There's always a way out!"
They had spent the whole day with me, filled with worry and fear. There was finally hope. Their faces lit up with joy.
But as the team approached, everyone's smiles froze.
"Samuel?"
Samuel looked at me, equally surprised.
"Mia, have you lost your mind?
"You've made such a scene just to get me back, even bringing my leader into this mess!"
Beside him, Sarah, wearing new clothes, smiled provocatively.
"Mia, Samuel and I really don't have anything between us. Is this your way of getting the leader to punish him?
"You can't always be so reckless. Don't you care about your husband's future?"
As Samuel listened to Sarah, his face twisted in anger. He reached out and grabbed me.
After standing for an entire day and night, my body was completely exhausted. As Samuel suddenly grabbed me, I lost control and lurched forward.
The neighbors screamed in panic, and the community police rushed forward without hesitation.
At that moment, their movements seemed to slow down, and the last thing I saw was Samuel's expression of utter disgust.
In the final second, I closed my eyes, thinking, "We've lived two lifetimes as a married couple with hearts far apart. And today, we die together. Fate is a cruel thing."

Chapter 4
The explosion that everyone expected did not happen.
The scene was eerily quiet.
I didn't know how long it took, but I finally mustered enough strength to open my eyes. That was when I realized that a man was holding onto my legs with all his might.
My body felt numb. My upper body was leaning forward, and my legs were firmly pressed down by him, yet I was still standing there as if nothing had happened.
A few military officers reacted first, hastily helping the man up.
"Mr. Foster, have you gone mad? This is a real war zone, a deadly minefield!"
"How could you be so reckless? If it had exploded, what would you have done?"
The man, Luke Foster, was cursed out thoroughly, but he didn't care.
"Then what do you suggest I do? This is an innocent life, how could I just stand by and watch her die right in front of me?"
As he spoke, everyone's gaze turned toward Samuel.
Samuel was unnerved by their stares and looked helpless.
"Are you all idiots? How can you all be so manipulated by this woman?
"I've been here before. I've cleaned this place. There are no landmines here!
"Mia, stop acting, apologize, and explain to everyone now!"
He said through gritted teeth, and Sarah, standing beside him, looked utterly innocent.
"Mia, doesn't everyone in the village know you're jealous of me? You're just making up excuses to get Samuel to come back!
"Now that you've gotten what you wanted, can't you just admit it?"
I nearly died, and I was still in a daze.
Seeing that I refused to speak, Sarah began to cry.
"Mia, it's my fault, is that enough to make you happy?
"I shouldn't have gone to town with Samuel, I shouldn't have made you jealous. I'll leave, is that okay with you?"
With that, Sarah turned to walk away. Samuel clenched his fists tightly and pulled her back.
"Sarah, you didn't do anything wrong, it's all this woman's fault.
"Mia, I married you because my mom forced me to. How long are you going to keep holding onto the title of my wife?"
As he spoke, he reached out to grab me, but his hand never made contact. Instead, Luke seized his wrist.
"Mr. Foster, you've been deceived by this scheming woman!
"This woman is a master of manipulation. I'll file for a divorce immediately. This doesn't concern you, so just leave."
Luke's face was cold as he gritted his teeth.
"Samuel! Even if she's not your wife, even if there's only a one-in-a-million chance, even if this landmine is a dud, human life is at stake. You have to save her first!
"Have you forgotten the values you were taught in the military?"
He then shifted his gaze to Sarah.
Sarah, frightened by the coldness in Luke's eyes, took a step back and weakly collapsed into Samuel's arms.
"Samuel, I see it now.
"No wonder so many people are willing to act with Mia. It's all because of him."
Although Sarah didn't make it explicit, everyone present understood her insinuation.
A few young neighbors couldn't hold their temper any longer and immediately spoke up for me.
"Sarah, I think you've lost your mind. Every time you open your mouth, you spread lies."
"Mr. Foster is someone we met on our way here. This is our first time meeting him today. There's no relationship!"
"Stop dirtying everything with your own filth. If you're trash, don't think everyone else is too!"
This statement didn't spare Sarah any dignity, and she burst into tears right there.
Chapter 5
Samuel was heartbroken. In front of everyone, he pulled Sarah into his arms to protect her.
"Enough! Are you all done yet?
"From the beginning, the only person I've ever loved is Sarah. If it weren't for Mia constantly stirring things up and my mom forcing me to marry her, I never would have married her!"
To defend Sarah, Samuel publicly belittled me, leaving me utterly disrespected.
If this had happened before, I would have been devastated and tried to explain myself endlessly.
But after narrowly escaping death twice, my mindset suddenly changed.
Whether Samuel loved me or not no longer mattered.
I had saved Ella with my own life, almost died at his hands, and no matter how much debt I owed, it was paid back.
I remained silent while they argued loudly.
Samuel was convinced I was acting. Seeing everyone standing up for me, he pointed at me, demanding that I admit my fault.
"Mia, you always talk about repaying kindness. Why aren't you doing that now?
"Today, if you admit that you were just acting, I'll consider the debt repaid. I won't use your money again from now on. Isn't that enough?"
I listened to his words, and my heart grew colder.
Samuel spent all his salary on Sarah, yet it was never enough.
To provide a good life for Sarah, Samuel had begun eyeing the small savings I had slowly accumulated.
I didn't eat meat, didn't buy vegetables, didn't buy new clothes, and the little bit of money I saved was taken by him to spend on another woman. Naturally, I wasn't happy.
Yet every time we argued, Samuel always managed to force me into submission.
"Mia, don't forget who raised you.
"You ate my family's food, use my family's things. Don't you think you owe us something?"
"If it weren't for me and Ella taking care of you, do you think you'd still be alive to argue with me here?"
*****
Every time he brought this up, I would be left speechless.
"But Samuel, when the flood came, my parents died saving your family!" I thought.
