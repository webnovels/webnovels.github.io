Gideon's beloved Lydia had given birth to his third child. 

On our tenth wedding anniversary, he brought yet another child conceived outside our marriage and said calmly:

“Lydia's child is the future heir of Gideon's family. As Mrs. Gideon, it's your duty to teach them well.”

I didn't react with tears or anger as I had before—I simply took the baby calmly. The guests erupted into laughter.

“I heard she made quite a fuss the last two times, but this time she's learned her lesson.”

“With the Quentin family bankrupt, she knows a scene won’t help. Without her own child, she’ll be out sooner or later.”

Gideon ignored their mockery and insults. I swallowed my bitterness and managed a smile:

“Gideon, let’s get a divorce.”

Gideon laughed, as though he’d heard the most ridiculous joke:

“Nora, if you can come up with a billion dollars right now, I'll sign immediately. Otherwise, stop pretending!”

Without replying, I dialed an unfamiliar number:

“I accept your terms.”

A cultured voice responded with a gentle laugh:

“A mere billion dollars. I can pay it for you anytime.”

1.

“But are you sure you want to give yourself to me for a man who isn’t worth it?”

The whispers of the guests cut into me like knives:

“I heard the Quentin family is drowning in debt, surviving only on Mr. Gideon's charity.”

“She’s like a stray dog. Without Gideon's family, she'd be on the streets tomorrow.”

Looking at the child in my arms, I felt a wave of sadness. In ten years of marriage, Gideon and his childhood sweetheart, Phoebe, had three children for me to raise.

Six years ago, I broke down when I refused. Gideon didn't relent, using my family's survival as leverage. Three years ago, when I resisted again, he took away my documents and kicked me out. 

In the freezing winter, I returned, crying and begging for his forgiveness.

We loved each other when we were young. He even took a bullet for me once. But now, as we've grown to loathe each other, it’s time to end it.

“I’m sure.”

The man laughed joyfully:

“In three days, everything will be as you wish.”

The call ended, and I stayed silent for a long time. Seeing my red eyes, Gideon’s mocking expression softened slightly:

“Nora, raising Lydia’s children to be healthy and strong is most important.

 As long as you behave, the position of Mrs. Gideon will always be yours. Don’t make trouble, okay?”

He rarely coaxed me, but it was for someone else. I was too tired to argue and turned to leave with the child.

Returning to Gideon's family, a picture book hit my forehead, nearly making me drop the baby. Six-year-old Ezra, their first child, glared at me angrily:

“Why didn’t you heat my milk?”

I endured the pain and looked at the two nannies picking their nails. One rolled her eyes:

“Mr. Gideon said taking care of the young master is the madam’s job. Don’t blame me for your laziness.”

Right... This was all Gideon’s doing. He deliberately arranged for me to care for his and Phoebe’s children, calling it “the responsibility of Mrs. Gideon.”

I remembered when Ezra had a high fever. 

I stayed awake for three days and nights to care for him. When he had chickenpox, I was covered in ointment to keep him company in isolation.

Despite the disputes between Gideon, Phoebe, and me, the children were innocent. The child I raised with love now looked at me with hatred.

Blood ties are stronger than water. To them, I was just a servant to push around. I eventually heated his milk, but as I handed it to him, he knocked it over forcefully.

“Can’t you even take care of a child?”

Gideon returned, his cold voice coming from behind. He pushed me aside:

“What if Ezra gets burned?”

My throat tightened. I’d tested the milk's temperature. It couldn’t have burned him, especially since I was the one who got splashed.

Ezra made a face at me and ran to Gideon:

“Dad, Mom is clumsy. When will you take me out to play?”

Gideon fondly ruffled his hair:

“In three days, we’ll go out with Auntie Phoebe and take your siblings.”

Phoebe’s smile froze when she heard this, but she clung tighter to Gideon’s arm. I noticed a jade ring on her finger—something my mother left Gideon before she died.

There was a billion-dollar transaction behind my marriage contract with Gideon. 

Thirteen years ago, when I was in love with Gideon, who wasn’t yet in control of Gideon's family, I was mistakenly diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer. 

To prevent affecting his fight for the family business, I broke up with him under the guise of family opposition.

Later, when my family was on the brink of bankruptcy, Gideon arrived with a billion dollars, saying if I married him, he’d save my family from ruin.

I was naïve then, thinking he loved me and we’d rekindle our romance. I never realized he came with hatred.

My mother entrusted the ring to him on her deathbed, and he promised with teary eyes to treat me well. Now, that ring on Phoebe’s hand was the biggest mockery to me.

“Sister, Gideon said I look good wearing this.” She noticed my gaze and shook her hand with a smile.

“After all, he said you don’t need to dress up while taking care of the kids, so wearing these is a waste.”

Gideon casually added, “It would just gather dust otherwise.”

My heart was heavy with unspeakable bitterness. I just wanted to turn and leave.

“Oh no!” Phoebe suddenly exclaimed. The ring fell to the ground and shattered. I instinctively reached for it but blacked out, hitting the coffee table.

As blood trickled down my forehead, I caught a glimpse of Gideon’s panicked face. 

He frowned and instinctively reached out to help me, but Phoebe suddenly cried out in pain, twisting her ankle. 

He immediately shifted his attention, lifting her up like a princess. And I fell to the floor.

2.

“Oh dear, sister, why are you so careless?” Phoebe leaned against Gideon, her voice sickeningly sweet.

“Gideon, should we call a doctor to check on her?”

Gideon frowned, glanced at me, hesitated for a moment, then spoke impatiently: “It’s just a scratch. Stop making a fuss.”

He turned and took Phoebe and their children upstairs to rest.

I walked alone to my storage room, hearing the nannies’ undisguised laughter behind me:

“Why put on airs like a madam in front of me? She didn’t die from the fall!”

I curled up on the small bed, drifting into a painful sleep. The wound on my forehead still ached.

Footsteps approached outside. Then Gideon’s cold voice came through:

“Behave tomorrow at the old man’s 80th birthday.”

I didn’t answer. The door was suddenly pushed open, and Gideon stood in the doorway with a medical kit. Before I could react, he roughly pulled me up, his grip making me frown.

“Know it hurts but don’t apply medicine?”

He sneered at my wound but took out an alcohol pad skillfully.

“Planning on showing the old man your sorry state tomorrow for sympathy?”

“Gideon,” I asked softly, “why did you marry me?”

He paused, then sarcastically pinched my chin:

“Because you needed Gideon's family’s billion dollars.”

In the darkness, I laughed silently through tears. I should have known he didn’t marry me out of love.

For ten years, he resented my parents for breaking us up, not knowing I left due to a false cancer diagnosis. By the time I wanted to tell the truth, he already hated me deeply.

I took a divorce agreement from my bag and placed it on the bed. I’d brought up divorce several times over the years, but it never succeeded.

 With my family bankrupt, and Gideon keeping me at home to care for the kids, I had no way to gather the billion dollars he demanded for my freedom.

He knew this well, never taking my requests seriously.

He said impatiently: “Nora, are you done making a scene?”

“This time is real.” I spoke softly but firmly.

“I’ll find a way to get the money and pay you back. Even if you don’t believe me, about you...”

Phoebe’s coquettish voice suddenly came from upstairs:

“Gideon~ Where did you put my pink lingerie~?”

Gideon immediately released me, crumpling the agreement and tossing it in the trash:

“Enough, you’ve squandered all your dowry over the years. Who else but me would give you a billion dollars?”

The door slammed shut.

The next day, I forced myself to put on makeup, covering the wound on my forehead, and attended the birthday banquet. But Gideon’s assistant seated me in the last row, with the drivers and nannies.

“Oh, isn’t this Mrs. Gideon?” A wealthy lady passed by, covering her mouth with a laugh.

“What are you doing sitting here?”

I sat in silence, hearing whispers behind me:

“I heard Gideon brought another child home. Miss Phoebe is truly blessed with many children, no wonder she’s favored.”

“Indeed, even as the legitimate wife, she’s now seated with the help. How embarrassing.”

I clenched my napkin, fingers turning white.

Moments later, Gideon strode over with Phoebe behind him:

“Who told you to sit here?”

The assistant said: “Miss Phoebe said you arranged for the madam to sit here.”

Phoebe’s face turned pale with panic, but Gideon just frowned, saying nothing. She smiled smugly again.

I followed Gideon to greet the old man. He kindly spoke a few words to me, then turned to Phoebe, displeased:

“Not just anyone can enter Gideon's family. Don’t bring random people here again.”

Phoebe’s face turned ashen. At that moment, Ezra and Willa suddenly clung to her, calling her auntie sweetly.
"Who allowed you to sit here?"

The assistant replied, "Ms. Lin said you arranged for ma'am to sit here."

Phoebe's face immediately showed panic, but Gideon just frowned and said nothing. She smiled smugly again.

I followed Gideon to greet the old man. After a few kind words, he turned to see Phoebe and said disapprovingly, "Not just anyone can walk into Gideon's family. Don't bring such unwelcome guests next time."

Phoebe's face turned pale. At this moment, Ezra and Willa suddenly jumped on her, sweetly calling her auntie.

 Phoebe's expression softened a lot since she had given birth to three children for Gideon. 

Even if the old man didn't like her, he would still show her respect for the children's sake.

The old man snorted and called Gideon away. I was about to get up and leave when Phoebe suddenly pressed my shoulder with a cold smile, "Sister, let's play a game."

3.

Phoebe took out a thermos from her handbag and suddenly grabbed Willa's wrist away from everyone's sight. "Good girl," she said, covering the child's eyes, "Mommy's going to do a magic trick."

"No!"

I rushed forward to stop her, but she shoved me away. 

The next second, a piercing cry echoed through the hall. Willa's fair arm instantly became red and blistered, and Phoebe quickly shoved the thermos into my hand.

"Help!"

Phoebe fell to her knees, holding the heartbrokenly crying Willa tightly, "Sister, if you have any grievances, come at me. 

Why scald Willa with boiling water? She's just a child!"

I was completely stunned, not expecting her to be so devious as to frame me and even harm her own child!

Gideon rushed over, saw Willa's injuries, and without thinking, kicked me to the ground, shouting angrily, "How could you harm such a young child! Are you even human?"

Gideon called the family doctor to treat Willa's wounds. 

Suddenly, Ezra started crying loudly. I lay on the ground, struggling to get up, trembling as I reached for Ezra, "Ezra, baby, don't be afraid... tell Daddy... who just..."

Before I could finish, Ezra hid behind Gideon in terror, crying, "It was Mommy! She poured hot water on Sister! I'm scared!"

I froze instantly, my outstretched hand dropping weakly.

"Are you really this jealous just because I brought Lydia to a party once? They're the kids you raised yourself!"

I opened my mouth, the taste of blood growing stronger in my throat, finally turning into a barely audible laugh. I looked into Gideon's furious eyes, "Gideon, do you really believe this?"

"He's only six. Can he lie?"

The guests around started whispering. Some called me "vicious," others said, "No wonder you can't have kids, with such a cruel heart." 

The crowd's accusations drowned me, but what hurt more was Gideon's hateful gaze piercing my heart. To him, I was nothing but a jealous and vicious woman.

Phoebe leaned into Gideon's arms, eyes red, "Sister, if you're sick, you need treatment. How could you do something so cruel?"

Ezra's cries grew louder, saying he was scared just seeing me. Gideon pointed at me and shouted, "Nora, get out of here where we can't see you!"

I wiped the blood from my mouth, stood up shakily, and took the divorce agreement I always carried out of my bag, smiling bitterly, "It's time to leave... sign it, and I'll leave quietly."

Gideon's anger grew, and he stood up, tearing the divorce agreement and throwing it in my face, "Without ten billion, don't even think about leaving! You'll be my wife for life, Nora!"

Outside, the rain poured down as I staggered into it, the cold rain mixing with my tears. Ten years of marriage, sincerity, and patience—shouldn't it end when I get the money tomorrow?

The next second, everything went black, and I fell down the stairs. Just as I thought I would hit the ground, I was suddenly caught in a warm, strong embrace.

"I was only late for a moment, and you made yourself this miserable, hmm?"

When I woke up again, I was in a hospital. The man in front of me was handsome, the current head of Carter Group, Declan Carter. 

I was about to speak when I noticed a familiar diamond cufflink on his suit sleeve, the gift I gave to a life-saver on my eighteenth birthday.

"You finally recognize me? I didn't waste years loving you."

Declan leaned in, his voice deep and magnetic. 

Memories surged back: when I was eighteen, I was kidnapped, and a young man risked his life to save me. Before leaving, I gave him my most precious birthday gift...

"It's you..."

My voice trembled as I instinctively tried to sit up, but he suddenly looked tense and supported me, "Careful, the doctor said you're pregnant, eight weeks."

I froze completely. The timing was just right; it was Gideon's last time with me when he was drunk and mistook me for Phoebe.

Declan chuckled coldly, "Interesting, Gideon kicked you out, not knowing his wife is pregnant with his child."

He smirked and looked at me with intense eyes, "But soon it won't be his."

I was overwhelmed by the barrage of news, "What?"

Declan laughed, "The ten billion has already been transferred; whether he signs or not, he has to."

4.

At that moment, Gideon was sitting in the villa garden, watching Phoebe and the two children playing on the lawn.

"How could sister not come back all night, how could she be so petty with you, the baby cried at night and it broke my heart."

Gideon sneered, about to speak when his phone vibrated. He casually opened the message, still thinking about how to teach me a lesson when I got back. But the message froze his smile instantly—

[Your account has received a transfer of 1,000,000,000.00 RMB, memo: divorce settlement]
"Gideon?" Phoebe sensed something was wrong and reached for his phone. "What’s happening?"

Gideon reread the message, disbelief etched on his face, before leaping up from his seat. Ezra nearly toppled over and began to cry loudly in fright.

He shoved Phoebe away, staring intently at the message, his fingers trembling uncontrollably.

One billion...

Could Nora really have gathered one billion?

"That's impossible," he muttered, immediately calling the bank for confirmation.

"Mr. Gideon, the amount has indeed been credited from the Carter Group's overseas account."
