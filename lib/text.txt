I got pregnant with my boyfriend who has a low sperm count. 

His mother offered me a huge sum to leave him.

I thought it was a joke and wanted to share the joy of my pregnancy with my boyfriend, but then I heard a woman talking about taking wedding photos with him.

To get rid of me, he and his fiancée conspired to paint me as the other woman.

 I ended up tearing apart our “home,” erasing all traces of myself, and boarded a plane abroad.

Two years later, Gideon found me in a frenzy. 

He stared intensely at the little child beside me, who bore a striking resemblance to him, and his eyes instantly welled up with tears. "Is this...mine??"

1

After hanging up the phone, I didn’t believe it. I thought it was just a prank because ever since I got with Gideon, the women around him always tried to separate us.

 I’d received over 1,300 calls claiming to be from Gideon’s mother.

Until evening, when Gideon came back.

“Ah Han, I have good news for you, I’m preg—” I leaped into his arms, wrapping mine around his neck, meeting his eyes. 

Gideon had a low sperm count, with an incredibly slim chance of fathering a child. His greatest dream was to have his own child. 

For this dream, Gideon's family went to great lengths; his mother even became a vegetarian, hoping to bring good fortune.

And now, I was pregnant with Gideon's child, and the pregnancy test result was in my pocket as a surprise.

 I looked at Gideon full of anticipation, imagining how happy he would be when he found out. But unfortunately, before I finished speaking, his phone rang.

Seeing the caller ID, he hesitated, then looked at me. In just a moment, he smiled, raised a finger to his lips, signaling me to be quiet.

I nodded obediently, feeling something had changed. 

He had never taken calls like this before. Once connected, I clearly heard a woman’s voice. “Gideon, don’t forget to take our wedding photos later.”

Instantly, a chill ran from my spine to the top of my head, freezing my entire soul. 

Remembering the call earlier, I felt tears stinging my eyes, and my hands holding his face dropped weakly.

“I’ll be right there.”

 He noticed my oddness but still smiled with such ease, even kissed me reluctantly. “Be good, wait at home, I’ll take care of you when I get back.”

Gideon dressed up, adjusted in front of the mirror for a long time, and only after confirming there was no unusual scent did he turn to leave. 

I was in shock for a long time, and by the time I reacted, he was already out of the room.

I hurriedly took out my phone to call him, but there was no answer. So, it’s true? Gideon is getting married to another woman.

With trembling hands, I took out the pregnancy test result from my pocket.

 Suddenly, a wave of weakness hit me, making me collapse to the ground, tears flowing like a fountain.

If he’s marrying another woman, then what am I? What about the child inside me?

Seven years of love, through thick and thin. All the vows Gideon made to me flooded my mind, overwhelming my body and soul. Finally, my body couldn’t bear the shock any longer and collapsed.

Before my consciousness faded, I was still wondering. What did my seven years with him mean?

Gideon returned at night, half an hour after I regained consciousness. I sat alone on the sofa, tightly clutching that pregnancy test result.

 He looked exhausted, smelling strongly of women’s perfume, with a glaring lipstick mark on his collar. 

Yet, even so, he still raised his eyebrows at me and said, “Yo, Adeline, what are you dazing about?”

I looked up at him, that red on his collar becoming more glaring. Going to meet his fiancée, he had to clean off the scent of other women. 

But with me, he was completely indifferent. Thinking about this, I couldn’t help but tighten my grip on the pregnancy test result.

Gideon saw I wasn’t speaking and casually smiled, then came over, hugged me like usual, and was about to kiss me. But in the next second, I slapped him across the face.

The slap was loud, especially distinct in the quiet space.

“Get out!” My tone was icy, hating his careless attitude toward our relationship. “Aren’t you going to explain the wedding photos?”

I looked at him, a chill filling my heart. He was stunned for a moment, then put down his hand that was covering his face, not angry, just glanced at me, and finally said blandly, “Marriage for me is just a show, it won’t affect our relationship.”

“Since you already know, I won’t hide it anymore. Tell me, what do you want? I’ll buy it for you.”

I was heartbroken to the extreme but still held on strong. 

“Gideon, you know what I want.”

His face darkened, losing that playboy demeanor, leaving only impatience and fatigue. 

“I can give you everything except a title.”

He made himself sound so noble. I clutched the pregnancy test result, my lips trembling, asking for myself and the child one last time. 

“So, you want me to be your mistress?”

Gideon looked at me, his eyes rarely serious. We locked eyes, mine resolute. As long as he said no, the pregnancy test result in my hand would still appear in front of him. 

He touched his nose, lowered his head, seemingly thinking about something. My heart raced, staring at him intently, hope rising in my heart.

But in the end, he disappointed me. He nodded and said, “Yes.”

I let out a bitter laugh. What a clear answer from Gideon, just like that, denying our years of relationship, placing me in the position of a mistress. 

It was like seeing clearly for the first time the man I had invested years in.

Seeing I didn’t react, he pulled me into his arms, helplessly persuading me as if he had no choice. “I’m just helping out at school here, my focus is still on the business world, and Lydia is my best match, equal in status.

 But marrying her won’t affect our relationship, I promise I’ll ensure you graduate from your master’s smoothly.”

So, he thought I was with him just for my master’s degree? In his eyes, our relationship was just a transaction.

I pushed him away, tears welling in my eyes, biting my lip to hold them back. 

“Since you only see benefits, then spend your life with your benefits. A person like you doesn’t deserve a family, much less a child!”

I put the pregnancy test result behind me. I already had the answer in my heart—this child, he doesn’t deserve to know about.

After hearing me out, he first looked at my hand behind me in confusion, then sneered, staring at me as if seeing through me. “Adeline, you’re right.”

“Yeah, I don’t deserve a child, just like you don’t deserve to marry into a wealthy family, otherwise in three years...” 

Gideon’s eyes glanced at my belly, full of ridicule. “Why hasn’t there been any movement from your belly? 

Otherwise, even if your belly was a little competitive, the position of Gideon’s daughter-in-law wouldn’t go to someone else, and I wouldn’t have to marry a woman I don’t love...”

While saying this, Gideon shrugged, the face I once liked for its carefree nature now full of helplessness. I instinctively retorted, “Who said my belly isn’t...”

I stopped myself in time, biting my lip.

 I can’t let my child be seen as a bargaining chip. He stared at me, suddenly reaching out, grabbing behind me.

“Been watching you hold something since you came in, let me see?” My heart jumped, I immediately stepped back two steps, not wanting Gideon to find the pregnancy test result.

“Come on! Let me see!”

 But the more I avoided, the more curious Gideon became, directly following up, holding me with one hand, reaching for the pregnancy test result in my hand with the other.

In the next second, the pregnancy test result was already in his hand.

“Give it back, you don’t deserve...” I hurriedly reached out to snatch it back, my mind full of thoughts about how Gideon doesn’t deserve to be this child’s father, and I don’t want my child’s father to be him either.

But how could I win against him?

Just as Gideon raised his hand to avoid my grab, about to open that pregnancy test result, seeing the child he'd been longing for about to appear before him, Gideon’s phone vibrated first.

He just glanced at the phone, then tossed the unopened pregnancy test result back to me. “Mysterious, don’t look if you don’t want to.”

Seeing the pregnancy test result tossed to the ground, the words “pregnancy test” glaringly obvious, I quickly ran over to pick it up. But in the next second, Gideon’s foot was already on top of it.

He handed me his phone. “Help me pick a nice wedding photo, it’ll be made into a poster for the wedding day.”

“Take your time choosing, I trust your taste.”

I squatted on the ground, looking up at him, tears inevitably falling. “So, you have to get married, right?”

Even knowing the answer, I couldn’t help but ask. I bit my lip, staring at Gideon, hoping for a different answer from him. 

Gideon moved his foot, walked to the front door, and opened it.

Outside, at some point, it had started raining heavily. He glanced back at me, his eyes unreadable. “Why ask the same question again?”

The rain poured down harder, splashing on the ground. I then heard Gideon say, “My wedding is the day after tomorrow. 

The marriage alliance with the Su family is my best choice, also the best choice for Gideon’s family.”

“Don’t worry, if you stay with me, I won’t treat you badly!”

---

“My wedding is the day after tomorrow!”

“Stay with me, I won’t treat you badly!”

Gideon stepped aside and walked to the front door, opening it swiftly.

Outside, it had begun to rain heavily at some point.

He glanced back at me, his eyes dark and inscrutable: "Why ask the same question again?"

The rain came down harder, splashing onto the ground.

Then I heard Gideon say, "My wedding is the day after tomorrow. This marriage alliance with Lydia's family is the best choice for both me and Gideon's family."

"Don't worry, if you stay with me, I'll make sure you're taken care of!"

Chapter 3

"My wedding is the day after tomorrow!"

"If you stay with me, I'll make sure you're taken care of!"

Gideon's words echoed in my ears, leaving me in shock.

After he finished speaking, Gideon left with large strides.

I picked up the pregnancy test report, holding it tightly to my chest, unable to contain my emotions.

Maybe I should have realized earlier that in the eyes of a true wealthy family's heir, only interest matters.

And I was merely a tool to satisfy his needs.

I should have known.

At that moment, I suddenly remembered when I first got together with Gideon, people envied me, saying I had caught the eye of Gideon's family's heir. Even if we couldn't stay together, there'd be plenty of money.

Back then, I said, "I like him for who he is, for his genuine feelings towards me, not for the money."

But now...

I was wrong; there were no genuine feelings.

Only blatant arrogance.

Listening to the roar of his sports car as he left,

I realized he wasn't afraid of losing me.

The next day, dragging my suitcase that I'd packed overnight, I was about to go to the hospital for an abortion when a strikingly beautiful woman knocked on my door.

When the woman saw me, she smiled gracefully, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear, "Hello, I'm Gideon's fiancée—Adeline, the eldest daughter of the Su family."

I caught my breath.

Adeline walked directly up to me, looking me over with a flash of jealousy and disdain in her eyes.

"So, you're Cora, Gideon's companion for three years, aren't you? You're certainly very beautiful."

Companion...

A wave of shame washed over me.

But Adeline's next words took my breath away.

"I heard you ended up in bed with him within a month of meeting?"

"As a fellow woman, let me give you some advice: the easier something is to get, the less a man cherishes it. Gideon and I are childhood sweethearts; he's never crossed the line. He said he wants to save my first time for marriage..."

Hearing this, I clenched my hand, my fingertips digging into my palm.

I pretended to be calm: "Miss Su, thank you for your concern. However, you might be mistaken. Gideon and I are boyfriend and girlfriend. It's mutual consent, so it's normal for us to have a relationship."

Adeline was taken aback, clearly not expecting a poor student like me to be so composed in front of a rich young lady like her.

I looked at her, with her eyebrows similar to mine, and continued: "If there's nothing else, I'll be going. I have other things to attend to."

"Wait!"

Adeline called after me, pulling out a bank card and a property deed from her bag and handing them to me.

"Gideon is eager for a child after learning about his family's genetic disorder. I didn't want to rush into it, so he chose this path."

"I don't blame him. As a woman, I understand you too. It's rare to find a wealthy bachelor, so I discussed it with Gideon's mother."

"This is the compensation given to me as Gideon's family's young mistress, so please accept it."

My heart ached terribly. Did everyone think from the beginning that Gideon approached me just to use me as a surrogate?

I was about to argue with her when a wave of nausea hit me, and I covered my mouth, retching, my body convulsing in discomfort.

Adeline looked surprised and asked, "Is she pregnant?"

But then she sneered.

With a naïve and disdainful tone, she looked at me with a superior attitude.

"How could that be? If you really were pregnant, someone like you, trying to climb up, wouldn't stay silent. After all, that's your ticket into a wealthy family."

"Even if you can't marry into one, the scraps from a wealthy family are enough for ordinary people like you to live on for a lifetime."

Adeline's voice was soft and sweet, like countless soft needles piercing into my heart.

It stirred up wave after wave of empathy.

My eyelashes trembled.

I reached into my pocket and touched the pregnancy test report. I really wanted to throw it in her smug face.

But then I thought, what's the point?

If word got out about a love triangle, it would seem like I still cared about Gideon.

I calmed myself and gently brushed away Adeline's hand, "No need. Even if I'm poor, I know money should be earned with a clear conscience."

Ignoring Adeline's furrowed brows and displeasure.

I turned and closed the door, placing the villa key in her hand.

"Also, here's the key. Please return it to Gideon for me."

With that, I stepped directly into the downpour without hesitation.

The rain drenched me instantly.

Behind me, Adeline's hysterical shouts rang out: "Stop pretending. Weren't you with Gideon for money? Why play hard to get with me?"

"You poor people are just parasites, the scum of society. You just want to be bloodsuckers, feeding off wealthy families."

"Cora, you can't leave! Did I say you could go?"

"Come back! I order you to come back!"

I heard her words, but I didn't argue or debate. Instead, I walked forward in the rain with determination.

I thought this would end with a peaceful breakup with Gideon, but they weren't planning to let me go.

"Ivy League Tech University female graduate student climbs into her thesis advisor's bed to marry into a wealthy family for a smooth graduation" became a trending topic.

Photos of me and Gideon entwined in the lab were posted online. His face was completely obscured, while I was fully exposed.

The dean called me into his office.

"I know you're dating Gideon, but this has caused too much of a stir. The university has decided to expel you."

Chapter 4

After leaving the university, my mind was numb as I somehow made it onto a bus, returning to the home I hadn't seen in a long time.

When I arrived home, the door was splashed with paint, with the words "Mistress, go die" written in large letters.

I took out my key to open the door, only to be grabbed by my perpetually drunk dad.

"Where's the money? The breakup money? Give it to me!"

He started to feel around my body, ignoring gender boundaries, and I shoved him away.

"No! There's no money!"

"Gideon and I were in love and broke up peacefully. I didn't ask him for money!"

"Nonsense!"

Another slap landed on my face.

My dad pointed at my nose, yelling, "Bullshit! What kind of bullshit love? The internet says you got millions in breakup money. You're trying to fool me!"

"If not for money, why climb into his bed?"

He stormed into the bedroom and grabbed a whip.

I instinctively trembled, memories of being abused as a child flashing before my eyes.

The whoosh of the whip, the unending pleas of pain, the agony of lacerations from the whip, and the ultimate torment of him rubbing salt into the wounds, making me feel like I couldn't live or die.

"Dad, don't..."

Watching him approach with the whip, I frantically pulled out the pregnancy test report and knelt down.

"Dad, you can't hit me. I'm pregnant with Gideon's child..."

He finally halted, paused, then snatched the pregnancy test report, and after reading it, kicked me in the shoulder.

"Shameless, just like your mother who ran away!"

"I heard Gideon has a low sperm count. How could the child be his? Tell me, which other man have you been fooling around with?"

The more he spoke, the more agitated he became, and the whip was about to come down.

"Today, I'm going to beat this disgraceful brat to death!"

I pushed him away and got up, grabbing a fruit knife from the coffee table and pressing it to my neck.

The blade cut into my neck, drawing blood.

Grievance and anger filled me, and my hand shook uncontrollably, making it hard to control the pressure.

"Fine! You want money, right? If I die now, you won't get a cent!"

Finally, my dad calmed down.

He squinted and asked, "Is it really Gideon's?"

At this point, I could only nod.

Instantly, my dad's mood shifted, and he was all smiles, wanting to drag me to find Gideon, saying I was now Gideon's family's young mistress.

"Stop!"

"What do you want to do now?"

I pressed the knife harder, causing more blood to seep out.

I bitterly curled my lips, "I'll go alone. If you come with me, it'll just be a scene. Only if I go and play the victim will I get more money."

Hearing that I could get more money, he let me go.

But I had no intention of finding Gideon.

I took out my phone, checked the tickets, and planned to head to a new place to start over.

To completely leave this oppressive environment.

But as I was looking at the tickets, I felt eyes on me like needles.

When I looked up, I noticed people passing by were giving me strange looks.

At that moment, my phone rang.

I opened Gideon's social media account and saw he had posted an electronic invitation to his wedding with Adeline.

He had publicly acknowledged our past and casually said,

"Please don't cyberbully Cora. She just likes me too much."

A wave of nausea surged from my stomach.

I covered my mouth, overwhelmed by sadness and anger.

Gideon did this, pretending to stand up for me.

But!
As I stared at the ticket, it felt as though curious glances were pricking at me. When I looked up, I realized that passersby were giving me odd looks.

Just then, my phone rang. I opened Gideon's social media account and saw he had posted the digital invitation for his wedding with Lydia. He casually acknowledged our past, saying, "Please don't target Miss Cora online, she's just overly fond of me."

A wave of nausea surged up from my stomach. I covered my mouth, feeling both grief and anger. Gideon's words seemed like he was defending me. But!

Wasn't he just confirming that I was the other woman? I wiped at my throat, feeling the sting of pain, unsure if it was from my heart or an actual wound.

With a trembling hand, I uploaded years of chat logs, photos of us together, and the gifts he gave me onto social media. "I'm Cora from the mistress scandal, but I'm not the mistress. Gideon and Lydia know very well who the real one is."

"When I found out Gideon was getting married, I was devastated. I thought our seven-year relationship was finally going somewhere. But Gideon told me he couldn't give me a title and wouldn't break off his engagement with Lydia."

"He wanted me to pretend nothing happened, to remain his compliant lover, while he and Lydia conquered the business world together."

"I refused and broke up with him. But to get rid of me, they painted me as a scheming graduate student willing to do anything to graduate. And what about Gideon? Isn't he responsible for deceiving his student?"

As my emotions ran high, blood trickled from my neck. I posted everything about my years with Gideon and what Lydia said to me online. I want everyone to see his true character.

Chapter 5  

After everything was said and done, my phone screen was stained with blood, but I felt a sense of relief.  

Finally, it was all out in the open.  

As soon as the statement was released, it went viral, and the internet was flooded with news about James and Emily's families.
