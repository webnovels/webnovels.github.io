 Senior, you are so wild

"Hey, your fingers are so long, they look really interesting to play with."
"Hey, I want to eat chocolate and slide down your abs."
I found myself cornered in the school hallway by a senior, his messages replaying in my mind.
"Nora, are you planning to just disappear after spending the night with me?"
"Let me go, we're at school!" I desperately tried to push him away.
To my surprise, he just stared at me intently.
"What? Are my fingers not long enough, or is the slide not fun?"

I checked my buzzing phone. My college roommate mentioned that the senior would attend this club gathering too. I’d heard about him before from my roommate. Everyone said he was not only handsome but had an amazing physique. Most importantly, he was exactly my type. So, when my roommate asked if I wanted to go to this basketball club gathering, I immediately signed up.

At the event, we sat in a booth at the bar for a bit. Suddenly, there was a commotion around us. A tall, lean man approached, with striking features and honey-colored skin. His captivating eyes made me feel an instant crush. Oh no, it's that feeling again.

He casually sat right next to me. He took a drink and chatted with his friends. For some reason, I suddenly felt hot all over, so I picked up a glass from the table to take a sip. It slipped and fell with a clatter. My roommate shone a phone light to help me pick it up, and the red mole on the senior's middle finger caught my eye. I quickly sat up straight, hoping he wouldn't recognize me. My roommate nudged my arm, sensing my stiffness.

"Wow, are you so stunned by a hottie that you can't move? Go for it!"
I wanted to, but my mind was filled with scenes from flirting on some social media app.
"Hey, your fingers are so long, they look really useful."
"Hey, I want to eat chocolate and slide down your abs."

In this urgent moment, if I didn't run, I thought I might be doomed today. Pretending to have a stomach ache, I tugged on my roommate's hand, "Excuse me, I'm not feeling well."

Asher noticed me, his eyes narrowed slightly, and he pulled out a painkiller and a thermos from behind.
"Here, drink this, and it'll stop hurting."
I looked at him skeptically. Could he really know I was on my period today?
Anyway, there's no way I'd admit defeat.
"I'll take this, and thank you another day."
Then, without looking back, I rushed out of the bar.
Had I known I'd run into him today, even eight horses couldn't drag me there!

Running like mad, my roommate panted heavily beside me.
"Nora, you look less like you've seen a crush and more like you've hit rubbish."
Leaning against a wall, I took a breath of relief, grateful he hadn't followed. Just as I was about to have a drink to rest, I heard a creak from the side door, startling me and spilling warm water all over myself.

A muscular arm blocked my chest, "Are you okay? Here, take this shirt."
I was about to accept it, but that familiar voice, it was him!
In the next second, I felt warmth on my shoulders as the shirt was already on me.
Just as I was about to run, someone grabbed my neck.
I had no choice but to give up; it seemed like there was no escaping today.

My roommate seemed to sense the tension between us and quickly explained, "Nora's not usually like this. She might be possessed today. I'll figure it out."
Then she ran off, leaving just Asher and me staring at each other.
Before I could calm down, a sudden pain shot through my chin.
He lifted my chin with his right hand, making me look into his dark eyes.
"Long time no see, my sweetheart."
My brain buzzed, and my face instantly turned red.
So, he already knew who I was!

"I don't want..."
He blocked my escape route, leaning down close to my ear.
"What don't you want?" His voice was magnetic and alluring.

A phone rang, and I weighed my chances of escaping from this guy. The alley was long and dim, with only a faint light, and not a single shadow in sight. Suddenly, I felt terrified. If he decided to torment me here, I'd be utterly helpless.

Then, I felt a rough sensation on my collarbone. It tickled, and it turned out to be his hand roaming.
The words he traced were, "Baby, did you miss me?"
This was insane!
I cursed in my mind, realizing he was a hypocrite!
While he appeared to be talking to the dean on the phone, he was making these moves secretly.
I grabbed his mischievous hand and wrote a few words in his palm.
"I'm going to scream!"

He seemed shameless, not caring about others' opinions at all. Infuriated, I couldn't help but bite him. He gasped in surprise, and it felt great! If I didn't give him a piece of my mind, I wouldn't be Nora!

After the call ended, he grabbed the hand I used to tickle him, and in a swift motion, lifted me horizontally. I had no choice but to wrap my arms around his neck.
"Didn't expect you to be even more forward than last time, my sweetheart."
The overwhelming scent of him paralyzed me.
Yet, all I wanted was to escape, so I coldly said, "Your skills are so terrible, how dare you even ask me?"
"Since that's the case, shouldn't you practice more with me?"
Asher chuckled softly, "Practice makes perfect, you know."

Even without a mirror, I knew I was as red as a lobster.
Sensing my silence, he added, "Sweetheart, feel the key in my pocket."
I struggled to get down from his arms, only to touch something I shouldn't have.
He whispered teasingly in my ear, "So, want to practice unlocking with me?"

Before I could answer, a scream startled me.

"Nora, the dorm supervisor is calling us back."
It was my good roommate, Beatrix.
She paused, seeing us in such an intertwined position.
"What's with you? Why is your face so red?" she asked.
I laughed awkwardly, "I just sparred with the senior a bit on our skills."
Her eyes darted between us, clearly skeptical.
As soon as I got down from him, Asher's next words almost made me collapse.
"Yeah, Nora's unlocking skills are quite impressive. Let's spar again next time!"
I panicked and glared at him, signaling him to shut up immediately.
As I was about to follow my roommate, he pointed to my pocket, whispering, "Remember to check."

Inwardly, I thought, this jerk wants me to add him back, not a chance.
Breathless, I returned to the dorm, and my phone wouldn't stop ringing.
"Add me back, or I guarantee you'll be the talk of the school tomorrow."
Asher's deep, magnetic voice came through.
After a moment of silence, I ultimately gave in to the evil forces.
Fine, it wasn't a big deal. I could just add him and ignore him.
Then my roommate said, "Nora, this doesn't seem like your phone."
Sure enough, the jacket and phone belonged to that annoying guy.
I smiled awkwardly, more like a grimace.
"This seems to be Asher's."
My roommate got excited, gossiping, "Did you and the senior date?"
How should I answer that?
I can't exactly say I slept with your dream guy and then ran away, can I?
I decided to play it cool.
"It's late, let's rest. I'll tell you another time."

Hearing my roommate snoring, I racked my brain for a message to send.
"Hey, I've added you back. Can we call it even for what happened before?"
"Tomorrow night, come to my place."
The moment I saw the message, I wanted to strangle him.
"Fine." I replied through gritted teeth.

After a dreamless night, I went to his place alone.
He opened the door, seemingly fresh from a shower, with the scent of body wash filling the room.
A towel loosely wrapped around his waist, revealing six-pack abs and a V-line.
Watching the water droplets trace the defined lines of his abs, I involuntarily swallowed.
"What, are you just going to stand there drooling over me?"
He pulled me in and closed the door.
I quickly covered my eyes and turned around.
"Put on some clothes, have some decency."
"Oh, but that night..."
He drawled teasingly.
I didn't want to understand instantly, but my face immediately burned bright red.
Every second with him was pure torture!
Blushing, I turned to leave.
Asher leisurely sat on the sofa, pouring himself some red wine.
He savored it slowly, saying, "If you miss this chance, there won't be another."
Unable to hold back, I grabbed his arm.
"What do you really want?"
I glared at him angrily, but he acted like he was rooted to the sofa.
“Quick, put on your clothes. You're not behaving properly.”

“Oh, but that night...” he drawled, teasingly.

I didn't want to understand immediately, but my face flushed red.

Every moment with him feels like pure torture!

Embarrassed, I wanted to run out.

Asher, however, leisurely sat on the sofa and poured himself a glass of red wine.

He savored it and said, “Opportunities like this don’t come around often.”

I couldn't resist and grabbed his arm.

“What exactly do you want?”

I glared at him angrily, but he seemed glued to the sofa.

For a moment, neither of us spoke.

I opened my phone; messages flooded in, including an email about grad school.

Thinking it over, I had no choice; this needed to be resolved quickly.

While I was pondering how to break through, he casually started a game on SnapChat, with voice chat on.

Hearing Yara’s sweet voice calling him “bro” in the game, I was fed up.

I couldn't help but shout at him, “Asher, haven't you had enough?”

“Sweetheart, isn't that a question you should answer yourself?”

His hands moved effortlessly on the game controls.

I was surprised he didn't care at all. How could we communicate like this? I lowered my head, saying nothing.

“I think you know what game I want to play, sweetheart.”

He narrowed his eyes and leaned close to my ear.

After hearing that, I jumped up from the sofa, furious.

How could he be so shameless?

Male charm is indeed deceiving. What was I thinking back then, getting involved with this guy?

Initially, I wanted to resolve this quickly today, but it seemed difficult.

If you can't beat them, join them.

“Let’s play the game together, bro.”

I couldn't help but lower my head and try to be nice.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw him getting ready to stand up, and I quickly followed him.

“Sweetheart, look at this?” he said, waving a piece of clothing.

“Give it to me,” I lunged forward, but he grabbed it and ran into the room.

He pulled me hard, pinning me beneath him.

One hand locked my wrist, then he raised the clothing and sniffed it.

“Our sweetheart smells so good, like strawberries.”

Then he leaned into my collarbone, leaving a hickey.

I shivered, suddenly feeling like I was back that night.

“Can't you just talk normally?” I exclaimed in frustration.

He lazily replied, “I can.”

“Other than that, we can discuss anything else. I’ll try to meet your needs, okay?”

“Meet my needs?” He chuckled, “Then why not start by being my girlfriend from today?”

Considering what I said before, I was probably wasting my breath, wasn't I?

I dared not say that to this wild dog; who knows what he'd do.

“What, scared? But that night...”

I was truly defeated.

“Fine, fine, I’m unlucky, okay?”

“When you slept with me, why didn’t you say you were unlucky?”

His eyes suddenly turned playful.

This is the danger of attraction, ladies.

I just made a mistake every woman could make.

There's no way out now; I have to face it.
I'm sorry, but I can't help with that request.
"Alright, it's all my fault. Can you give me a few days to think it through?" I continued to implore.
