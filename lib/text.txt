I carefully selected 999 red roses for Sophia Evans.

Her male secretary broke out in hives.

Sophia was furious. Using my mother's heirloom as bait, she forced me to fight a lion bare-handed.

She casually instructed her subordinates: "It doesn't matter if he dies. As long as it cleanses Ryan's bad luck."

I remained silent.

At the cost of 6 broken ribs and being mauled bloody by the lion,

I successfully retrieved the heirloom and calmly turned to leave.

Behind me, Sophia sneered: "He's nothing but a lowly bodyguard I keep. How could a dog ever leave its master?"

What Sophia didn't know was,

Someone had already bought out my contract for a high price.

This time, I was going to protect someone else.

Chapter 1

The iron cage opened, and the massive lion roared as it charged out.

I faced it bare-handed, instantly knocked to the ground!

On the platform above, Sophia clenched her fists tightly.

Jack's face was flushed, his eyes sparkling.

Sophia's brow relaxed. It seemed they were telling the truth.

This really could cleanse Ryan's bad luck.

The lion slammed into me, and I felt like my internal organs had shattered.

I countered with a punch to the lion's eye.

The crowd gasped.

I was covered in blood but never backed down.

After accurately grabbing the nearby hunting rifle, I precisely shot the lion's throat.

One shot killed it. At the cost of 6 broken ribs and being mauled bloody by the lion.

I had won.

I successfully reclaimed my mother's heirloom.

Just as I was about to exit the underground arena,

Ryan suddenly turned pale and coughed heavily.

Sophia's eyes instantly changed. She snatched the heirloom I had fought so hard to retrieve from my arms.

The jade bracelet was viciously smashed, shattering into pieces.

Sophia frowned slightly, her eyes filled with disgust as she looked at me.

"Are you satisfied now that you've hurt Jack so much for a mere bracelet?"

I opened my mouth but was left speechless.

When Ryan choked on some water, Sophia splashed black dog blood on the heirloom.

He coughed once, and Sophia used the heirloom to force me to fight the lion.

My ribs were broken in six places, and my body wouldn't stop bleeding.

I didn't understand who was really hurting whom.

My nails dug deep into my palms.

I skillfully knelt down and kowtowed to her.

"I'm sorry, Miss. Please forgive me."

I bent down with difficulty, cherishing the fragments in my arms beyond measure.

Mom, this time, I will take you away.

The kneeling motion caused my shirt to be stained with fresh blood again.

Sophia's pupils constricted, and her brow twitched violently.

She unexpectedly helped me up.

"As long as you don't oppose Jack, I'll let you stay by my side and earn your keep."

Her tone was condescending, as if it were a great honor.

As she finished speaking, Jack suddenly fainted without warning.

Sophia's face instantly tensed. Jack's lackey quietly reported,

"Miss Evans, it might be the negative energy from a dead person's belongings that's making Mr. Parker feel unwell repeatedly."

I looked up.

A flash of triumphant joy quickly passed through Jack's tightly closed eyes.

He gripped Sophia's hand tightly and said understandingly: "Sophia, I'm fine. After all, this is Mr. Wilson's mother's heirloom. I can endure it."

Sophia stroked Jack's cheek lovingly and calmly ordered me.

"Throw away that disgusting thing. If it makes Jack feel unwell again, you can get lost too."

I looked at her indifferently and resolutely walked towards the door.

Seeing my lack of reaction, Sophia's chest visibly heaved.

She ordered someone to bring a whip and sneered.

"Even a dog dares to defy its master. A beating will do."

The whip fell like raindrops, each lash accompanied by a sharp whistling sound.

The wounds already torn open by the lion's fangs now bled even more profusely.

The force of the blows on my body lessened slightly, and Sophia mocked,

"It seems I've really been too indulgent with you. Now you don't even know how to beg for mercy?"

Every pain on my body reminded me.

Constant retreat would only make her more aggressive.

I bit my lip hard, clutching the fragments tightly in my arms, not letting myself cry out.

Sophia's breath caught, and the whip she wielded showed no mercy.

The whipping continued for a long time. The smell of blood from the lion's corpse stimulated my blurring consciousness.

Before losing consciousness,

I vaguely heard Sophia's cold laughter.

Her fingers casually swiped across my phone screen.

"A dog wanting to book a flight to run away from home? Just break its legs."

"Mere 99 lashes, just use some medicine to keep it barely alive."

"Oh right, quickly check on Jack. His health isn't good, remember to give him the best medicine."

I involuntarily passed out.

My mind couldn't stop thinking.

Now I'll miss the flight.

Chapter 2

When I woke up,

Sophia was sitting by my bedside, which was rare.

She looked down at me condescendingly, handing me a plastic bag with obvious disgust.

The wounds on my body were still aching faintly.

I lowered my head to look - it was full of fragments of the jade bracelet.

I was somewhat surprised that Sophia hadn't thrown them away.

"It was Jack who begged me not to throw them away. If only you were half as sensible as him."

I rummaged through the fragments, but my heart suddenly plummeted.

These were clearly just replaced fakes.

I pulled out the IV needle expressionlessly.

Jack suddenly appeared in the doorway, speaking slowly and deliberately: "Mr. Wilson, I've already returned your mother's jade bracelet intact."

He enunciated each word, a flash of provocation passing through his eyes.

Ever since he had entered the house, Jack had found me, the bodyguard, disagreeable in every way.

When hungry, he'd make me brave pouring rain to buy roast duck 50 kilometers away.

When the mood struck, he'd drag me out in the middle of the night to buy condoms for them.

Time and again he tried to destroy the last heirloom from my mother, just to force me to give up and leave.

I didn't understand. Wasn't Sophia completely devoted to him?

I was just a dog for Sophia to torment and train as she pleased.

Why did he want to destroy the last fantasy my mom left me?

All the anger surged to my head.

Ignoring the lingering pain in my body, I grabbed the fruit knife from the table.

I pressed it hard against Jack's throat, my voice ice cold.

"Give me back all those fragments!"

Jack cried like a frightened rabbit: "Sophia, I'm scared..."

Without Jack saying more,

The next second, I felt my scalp being forcefully yanked.

The small knife in my hand uncontrollably cut Jack's shoulder.

Tiny beads of blood appeared.

I was forced to look up at Sophia.

But I met a pair of extremely cold eyes.

In them was undisguised disgust, and a flash of murderous intent.

She laughed coldly and stabbed the fruit knife into my chest.

"Although you're my husband, don't forget who saved you back then! Do you want to experience being bitten by a lion again?!"

"Squelch!"

Blood instantly gushed out!

My pupils constricted, and I instinctively tried to pull out her hand, but she pressed down hard.

"Don't move... it'll be over soon."

I was in so much pain that the veins on my forehead bulged.

The woman's tone was rarely comforting.

Enduring the pain, I looked at Sophia with an extremely calm gaze.

At this moment, a strange sense of irritation suddenly welled up in Sophia's heart.

She slowly carved out that piece of flesh.

Blood flowed down my chest, staining my trouser legs red, and also staining her hands red.

Sophia looked at the words on my chest with satisfaction -

"Sophia Evans".

Just because I accidentally cut Jack,

Sophia personally carved a retaliatory tattoo on my body.

She casually tossed the fruit knife on the ground.

Sophia carefully embraced Jack, her tone pampering:

"It's okay, I'm here. I won't let you have even a tiny scar."

Jack immediately kissed her lips shyly, his face full of guilt:

"This was a gift from you. Luckily we found it. But I wrongly accused Mr. Wilson. Should I apologize to him?"

In front of everyone, looking at me covered in blood stains,

Sophia's voice was utterly cold.

"No need. He's just a bodyguard, a dog I keep. What's the big deal about suffering a little grievance?"

They started kissing deeply right in front of me, as if no one else was there.

But over these three years, I had already heard countless such sounds of debauchery.

My phone vibrated.

I couldn't help but smile.

My contract had completely fallen into her hands.

The flight ticket Sophia had cancelled was rebooked.

While kissing Jack passionately, Sophia discreetly observed me out of the corner of her eye.

Seeing the smile on my face that she hadn't seen in a long time,

The irritation in her chest inexplicably surged up again.

Before entering the bedroom, she coldly commanded: "I'm throwing Jack a birthday party tomorrow. You better show up too!"

Taking advantage of the sounds of lovemaking coming from the bedroom,

I quickly searched the entire villa.

I finally found those jade bracelet fragments.

Carefully gluing the pieces back into a bracelet shape.

I hugged it to my chest, having lost and regained it.

Tomorrow, I will leave with you.

Chapter 3

The birthday party Sophia had meticulously prepared began promptly at 8 PM.

Jack, wearing a pure black custom-tailored suit, made a striking entrance arm-in-arm with Sophia.

The guests pushed me aside, quietly discussing among themselves.

"Mr. Parker is truly talented. No wonder Miss Evans has doted on you so much all these years."

"But I thought that bodyguard was Miss Evans' lawful husband?"

Sophia looked at me, rarely dressed formally, her tone carrying a hint of tenderness: "Introduce yourself to everyone."

There was a trace of expectation hidden in her voice that even she hadn't noticed.

I kept my head down, my tone neither servile nor overbearing.

"I am Sophia Evans' bodyguard - Jack Wilson."

Sophia was visibly stunned for several seconds, her expression visibly darkening.

An expression of annoyance flashed across my face.

What did she want me to do?

Jack smiled generously, a flash of malice in his eyes as he beckoned to me.

"I'm not feeling well today and can't drink. You drink all this alcohol for me."

I remained silent, finally opening my mouth.

"I'm allergic to alcohol..."

"Sophia, I know Mr. Wilson is probably still angry with me, so he's just making up this lie."

Jack hung his head, his voice filled with disappointment.

Sophia glanced at me, her voice growing heavier: "Drink! Don't you always carry allergy medicine? Take it before drinking, what could happen?"

Her tone left no room for refusal.

I silently took out the medicine and swallowed a few pills.

Soon, a group of people came forward with wine glasses to make small talk. I also picked up a glass and poured it down my throat.

Glass after glass, my stomach churned violently, unable to stop the urge to vomit.

The wounds that had not yet healed burst open under the effects of the alcohol.

Seeing the blood at the corner of my mouth, Sophia very obviously took a sharp breath.

The next second, Jack let out a scream.

"Sophia, the heirloom watch you gave me is missing. Jack was the only one near us just now, could it be that he..."

My pupils constricted, not because of this baseless accusation, but because the heirloom gift my mother had given to Sophia as a daughter-in-law,

She had casually given away without any burden on her conscience.

Back then, she had been so good to me and my mother.

At this moment, I couldn't help but laugh self-mockingly.

Sophia looked at my smile, and the familiar feeling of irritation surged up in her heart once again.

She personally comforted Jack and sternly called for the security guards.

The next second, several guards pinned me to the ground, forcefully tearing at my clothes.

Normally, I wouldn't have been so powerless to resist.

But with the new wounds Sophia had inflicted over the past two days, my body simply hadn't had time to recover.

I struggled desperately, but couldn't overcome their brute force.

My shirt was torn to shreds, the tattoo on my body faintly oozing blood.

Sophia narrowed her eyes, revealing only her desire to control me.

Until -

"The watch has been found!"

Sophia took the emerald watch and personally put it on Jack's wrist, her tone doting.

"Don't be so careless next time."

Jack scratched his head embarrassedly, looking at me with a face full of guilt:

"This was a gift from you. Luckily we found it. But I wrongly accused Mr. Wilson. Should I apologize to him?"

In front of everyone, looking at me covered in blood stains,

Sophia's voice was utterly cold.

"No need. He's just a bodyguard, a dog I keep. What's the big deal about suffering a little grievance?"

In the bathroom, I couldn't stop dry heaving.

Before I could recover, Jack kicked me hard.

He pressed down hard on the tattoo on my body, veins bulging on his forehead.

"You're really cheap, aren't you? You're just a dog Sophia keeps, yet you still cling to her!"

"Speaking of which, do you know why Sophia sent you to buy medicine in the next city when your mom was critically ill?"

"It was because she just wanted to get rid of you. At that time, I stripped naked with Sophia right in front of your mom - she was literally angered to death!"

"Slap!"

After slapping Jack's face, I couldn't hold back anymore and grabbed his throat.

Jack laughed coldly, instantly fighting back.

He kept splashing cold water on me, but accidentally touched a dry electrical appliance.

In the blink of an eye,

We both heard the sizzling sound from the electrical appliance simultaneously.

The next second, it instantly exploded, and the entire bathroom was filled with thick smoke.

Soon, anxious cries for help were heard outside the door.

Sophia's voice came along with the sound of high heels: "Where's Jack Wilson!"

She rushed in regardless of the raging fire.

But her gaze immediately fell on Jack, who was pretending to faint.

He reached out his hand, tears in his eyes: "Sophia, save me..."

Ignoring me whose shirt was dyed red with blood.

Sophia's face tense with worry as she supported Jack and walked out without looking back.

From beginning to end, not a single glance fell on me.

I fell to my knees weakly, choked by the thick smoke. The pain on my body seemed to magnify infinitely in an instant.

The next second, a pair of black leather shoes appeared in my vision.

I looked up dazedly, and it was actually Jack's lackey.

A vicious smile appeared on his face as he pushed me hard.

Already next to the window, I fell unprepared.

"Don't blame me for being ruthless. Only if Jack has good days can I rise with him."

He turned back confidently, not realizing he had actually helped me escape the fire scene.

It was only the fourth floor.

I dragged my limping leg and hailed a taxi, telling the driver: "Airport."

The scenery outside the car window rapidly receded.

I took out my phone, removed the SIM card, and snapped it in half -

"Crack."

The card broke into two halves, casually tossed out the window by me.

Sophia Evans, from now on, you and I will completely disappear from each other's lives!
