In the fifth year of my marriage to Daniel Thompson, he had an affair with his personal assistant because I couldn't get pregnant.

He brought her home, took over the master bedroom, usurped my position as the lady of the house, and occupied the place by his side.

I never made a fuss, just packed my bags and prepared to leave.

But he sneered and said, "Don't forget, your parents' lives are in my hands."

His friends bet in front of me, guessing when I would kneel and beg Daniel to take me back.

At the auction, he helped his little assistant humiliate me.

What he didn't know was that my parents were already dead, and he was the one incapable of having children.

As I watched my long-lost love return, I secretly vowed.

This time, I would not only leave, but also ruin his reputation completely.

Once again, as I watched Olivia Baker cling to Daniel Thompson in front of me, I no longer felt much of anything.

But he still refused to let me go, speaking in a commanding tone.

"Olivia is due to give birth in a few days. Quit your job and stay home to take care of her food and daily needs."

Hearing this, I suddenly realized that these five years of marriage seemed meaningless.

"Daniel, let's get divorced."

...

After a brief silence, mocking laughter erupted from the karaoke room.

"Did I hear that right? Rachel wants to divorce Daniel? Wasn't she the one who desperately clung to him in the first place?"

"Don't fight me on this, I bet she'll be back on her knees begging Daniel to take her back within a day!"

"Sis, what's gotten into you? Are you jealous of Olivia?"

"What, are you feeling sorry for her?" Daniel coldly retorted, his gaze towards me growing icy. "Are you sure about this?"

"Yes, I'll send you the divorce papers."

With that, I turned to leave, but Daniel suddenly called out to stop me.

"Rachel Wilson, don't forget, your half-dead parents still need the Thompson family's support."

He dared to bring up my parents.

Seeing I remained silent, he stood up and looked down at me imperiously, his tone threatening.

"You'd better think it through. Do you know how much your parents' annual medical expenses are? Can you afford it?"

Olivia chimed in from the side.

"That's right, sis. Uncle and auntie are still waiting for life-saving treatment."

I glared at their hypocritical faces, wanting nothing more than to slap them both.

Meeting my reddened eyes, Daniel spoke coldly: "Name your price. How much to take care of Olivia?"

How much was five years of a marriage where I was treated like dirt worth?

I didn't bother to calculate.

I only knew that the last time I refused him, I ended up being forced to drink with executives at a karaoke bar until I had a gastric hemorrhage.

I took Olivia's hand and pretended to say to her:

"I'll take good care of you and the baby."

Hearing this, Daniel surprisingly gave me an out: "Don't worry, as long as you take good care of them, your parents will be safe and sound too."

Just as he finished speaking, Olivia, whose hand I was holding, suddenly collapsed to the ground with a miserable cry.

I stood there stunned, not knowing what to do. Daniel slapped me hard across the face.

He carried her back to the bedroom and ordered the housekeeper to call the family doctor.

Seeing this situation, not only did the people around find it amusing.

I found it funny too.

Following them into the bedroom, seeing Olivia's emotions had calmed, I turned to leave.

But Daniel coldly grabbed my hand.

"Apologize!"

"What..."

Before I could finish, he kicked the back of my leg.

With a thud, I fell to my knees in front of Olivia before I could react. My knees were bleeding, but I heard him yell angrily:

"You made Olivia fall, shouldn't you apologize to her?!"

I looked coldly at Daniel. In our five years of marriage, I had apologized countless times.

Apologized for mistakes in documents.

Apologized for disturbing his work.

Apologized even for seeing him go to hotels with Olivia...

Swallowing my grievances, I knelt on the ground and kowtowed to Olivia three times, saying "I'm sorry" with each bow.

I looked indifferently at Daniel and spoke flatly: "Is that enough?"

Staring at the blood on my forehead, he paused before speaking with disgust:

"Who are you putting on this act for? If you want to leave, then leave. You're bad luck. Don't end up harming Olivia and her child."

Seeing he didn't seem to want to trouble me further, I breathed a sigh of relief and quietly left the Thompson mansion.

I took a taxi to the hospital and received my parents' death certificates from the doctor.

They had died last week, but Daniel was still using them to threaten me.

At the time, the hospital called asking me to pay the bills. My salary hadn't come in yet, so I called Daniel crying, but all my calls went unanswered.

I tracked his location and rushed to the hotel, but the lobby manager wouldn't let me in.

I didn't care and kicked open the door, immediately seeing Olivia half-naked on the bed.

He hurriedly covered her, speaking fiercely:

"Who allowed you to come in?! Get out!"

I knelt down outside the door and begged:

"Can you lend me $50,000? I..."

Before I could finish, he cut me off:

"Are you deaf? I told you to get out! Forget $50,000, I won't even give you $5. Assistant! Throw her out!"

I knelt on the ground begging desperately, crying my heart out, gasping for breath, with no shred of dignity left.

I saw Olivia provocatively showing off the ring on her ring finger.

The unique diamond ring was priceless - she couldn't afford it. I knew Daniel must have given it to her.

But I had no energy to argue with him. I crawled over and grabbed Olivia's feet, pleading:

"Olivia, I won't fight you for anything. Please lend me $50,000, I'm begging you."

But her response was a cold snort, followed by Daniel's slap that sent me crashing to the floor beside the bed.

"I told you to get out!"

I was thrown out of the hotel and brought home by his assistant, forced to kneel on the cold tiles in the living room.

I was ordered to apologize non-stop. If I slacked off even a little, a bucket of cold water would be poured over me.

It was at this time that my parents died in the hospital when their oxygen machines stopped working.

Looking at my parents' death certificates, tears unconsciously fell from my eyes. I cried heartbrokenly, attracting attention from many people.

The doctor told me to restrain my grief and took me to identify my parents' bodies in the morgue.

I had my parents' bodies cremated and carefully placed the ashes in urns.

My once loving parents had become two wooden boxes. Unable to accept it, I fainted at the crematorium from overwhelming grief.

When I opened my eyes after fainting from shock, I saw Daniel dealing with work matters.

Our eyes met for a long while. He picked up a glass of water and moved to feed me.

But I shook my head and took the glass, drinking it all in one go.

Seeing this, Daniel's outstretched hand paused. His chest visibly heaved as he spoke with some displeasure:

"How are you feeling? Better? I only just found out that uncle and auntie had passed away..."

Before he could finish, I cut him off:

"Please give me back my phone."

Perhaps my tone was too cold. Daniel was stunned for several seconds before handing me the phone from the table.

Glancing at the divorce agreement I had drafted on the phone, he frowned and asked unhappily:

"Rachel, who's getting divorced?"

I hadn't seen him ask so many questions before. Feeling irritated, I spoke directly:

"Us."

Hearing my reply, he spoke with displeasure:

"How long are you going to keep this up? Your parents' deaths were an accident. Don't you trust me?"

I waved my hand, not wanting to get into this trouble. My tone was calm:

"I was just joking."

He immediately breathed a sigh of relief, changing his tone to comfort me:

"I know you're heartbroken about mom and dad passing, but you can't joke about things like this."

I didn't answer. The next moment, his assistant walked in to tell him:

"Mr. Thompson, Miss Baker is awake and asking to see you."

Seeing him torn, I lay down and closed my eyes:

"Go see her. I'm a bit tired and want to sleep."

Before leaving, he leaned close to my ear and instructed:

"Cooperate well with the doctors' treatment. I'll come see you after I check on her."

I kept my eyes tightly shut without responding. Only when the room was completely quiet did my tense body finally relax.

But the next second, a call from an unfamiliar number came through on my phone.

I answered reluctantly, my tone cold:

"What is it?"

But the other person didn't care about my strange tone, excitedly saying:

"Rachel! Chris is back!"

One sentence made my brain short-circuit. I asked in disbelief:

"What did you say?!"

"Chris Carter has completed his mission! He's returned to base!"

I almost instinctively jumped out of bed, yanking out the annoying IV in my hand, and rushed out of the hospital to take a taxi to the military base in the suburbs.

And in my heart, I silently started the divorce countdown.

In three days, I would completely leave Daniel Thompson.

Reuniting with Chris Carter was an extremely difficult thing. He had been traumatized and forgotten me completely.

He wouldn't allow anyone to approach him, just mumbling words others couldn't understand:

"Silly girl, silly girl... I want to see my silly girl!"

But I knew he was calling my nickname.

The doctor told me that to fully recover, we would need to go to America to find the top medical team, with only a 50% chance of success.

As my phone screen lit up, I turned my gaze to the divorce agreement on my phone.

My thoughts drifted to Daniel Thompson. I silently modified the terms from "adultery during marriage, assets split 50/50" to "I don't want a penny."

I wanted to sever all ties with him.

At this moment, Daniel also called me, anxiously asking:

"Rachel, where are you? Why aren't you resting properly in the hospital?"

I was immersed in the joy of reunion, but had to perfunctorily respond to him:

"What is it? I'm very busy right now."

"I've neglected you these past few days. I want to take you to the new product auction to make it up to you."

Seeing I didn't respond, he persisted:

"How about tomorrow? The Zhike Ziye new product auction. I'll take you to see if there's anything you like."

These words touched me a little.

But his next words slapped me in the face again:

"But Olivia is insisting on going to the Bund with me. Tomorrow I'll take you after I get back."

I smiled mockingly, simply replying with a "Mm" and agreeing to his trap.

If I still liked him because of my parents before, I would definitely have a big fight with him.

Then sulk alone, but now I wanted to leave and didn't care about anything he did.

After all, divorce is no small matter. I had to prepare a big gift for him.

Seeing I agreed, he didn't think much more of it, tossing aside my unusual behavior.

He thought I would be like before, comforting myself and then eagerly going back to him.

But I had already awakened and wouldn't make the same mistake again.

Daniel Thompson, you and your illusory love.

I don't want any of it anymore.
