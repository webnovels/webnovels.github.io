 After eight years of love, I received a pregnancy report from my husband's secretary. I gave him the divorce agreement directly.

Jasper won the MMA championship on the same date as our five-year wedding anniversary. That day, I received a gift he had prepared for me: Phoebe's pregnancy test report, the secretary of the MMA Club.

Seeing my devastation, he spoke with indifference, "Adeline, Phoebe's health is poor. I'm planning to let her move in with us. You're a doctor, so it would be convenient for you to take care of her."

I hid my own pregnancy test report and called Finn, my Declan, agreeing to go to the USA for further studies with him. But just a few days before leaving, I saw the chat records between Declan and Phoebe on his phone.

【Are you really going to the USA with that woman to fulfill my relationship with Jasper?】

【What if she finds out that it was you who hired those people to break her right hand so she can never hold a scalpel again?】

I wiped away my tears and changed my flight ticket, deciding to head to the UK instead.

I looked up at Jasper in his sleek outfit, a far cry from the boy I met eight years ago in the emergency room, who couldn't even afford a few bucks for medicine and nervously tugged at his tattered clothes.

Then I heard Jasper's voice, deeper and more magnetic after eight years, with a hint of hesitation. "Also, she wants that ring..."

I glanced at the simple ring on my left ring finger. Jasper bought me this ring with his first prize money after winning second place in a fight. At the time, seeing the ring in the box and his bruised face, I couldn't hold back my tears. Seeing me cry, he panicked immediately.

"Adeline, don't cry. I know I've wronged you... This ring may be the cheapest in the store, but once I win more fights, I'll definitely get you the best one!"

But even after he won more fights, eight years later, I still only had this simple ring. And today, he wanted me to give even this ring to Phoebe.

Seeing my hesitation, Phoebe clung to his arm, speaking with a hint of grievance. "Jasper, if Adeline really doesn't want to, then forget it... I just really like this ring. You know I'm not with you for money or status..."

Jasper, seeing her like this, felt heartbroken. He turned to me with impatience, forcibly took the ring off my hand, and handed it to Phoebe. Then they left without saying another word to me.

I looked at the bruises on my hand, and tears finally started flowing from my eyes.

When Jasper and I first got married, I once cut my hand while slicing fruit. It was just a shallow cut, but it pained Jasper immensely.

"Adeline, your hands are meant for holding a scalpel and saving lives. You can't get hurt. Let me handle these chores."

But after just five years of marriage, things had changed so drastically.

I gathered myself and went downstairs to throw out the trash, only to run into Phoebe coming back alone. She looked at my swollen eyes and couldn't help but laugh.

"Did you really think I wanted that cheap ring? Jasper already bought me something much more expensive." She said, raising her hand and tossing the simple ring into the community's pond. The diamond on her ring finger dazzled my eyes.

Back home, I hid the pregnancy test report I had planned to give Jasper as an anniversary gift and called my Declan, Finn.

Before meeting Jasper, Finn had been interested in me. To be honest, if I hadn't met Jasper, I might have really married Finn. Even after my marriage, Finn supported me a lot in my work and studies.

A year ago, Finn asked me to go to the USA for a three-year study, but since Jasper had just started the MMA Club, I declined. However, he said he would always keep that opportunity open for me.

"Declan, I'm willing to go to the USA with you for further studies."

"Adeline, are you sure? It's a three-year trip. Are you really willing to leave Jasper?"

"I've made up my mind, Declan. I've already decided to divorce Jasper."

Finn booked the flight for a month later.

On the day I went to the lawyer to draft the divorce papers, I passed by Jasper's MMA Club. Thinking about the effort I put into it, I decided to take a look and say goodbye to the members.

Unexpectedly, I saw two figures entangled in the stairwell and heard Jasper and Phoebe's voices.

"Jasper, be gentle~ Don't bite there~"

"Phoebe, you're so soft and smooth..."

"Hmph, did you say the same to Adeline? I heard she even took a stab for you. Such deep love..."

I stood there, feeling as if I had fallen into an ice pit. That's when Phoebe noticed me, quickly pushed Jasper away, and came over while adjusting her clothes.

"Adeline, don't mind us. I just needed Jasper to help me with my bra clasp~" She said, but secretly pinched the bruises on my hand.

In pain, I reflexively tried to pull my hand back, causing Phoebe to fall down the stairs.

Jasper pushed me aside and rushed to carry Phoebe to the hospital.

I sat frozen in the club's office, and hours later, Jasper finally returned.

"Phoebe lost the baby. I saw you push her down the stairs."

"Adeline, when did you become so vicious?"

"Even if Phoebe did something wrong, couldn't you forgive her for the child's sake?"

I looked at his face, full of undisguised contempt, and let out a cold laugh.

"Are you referring to her mistake of seducing a married man?"

Jasper's face darkened. "I fell in love with Phoebe first! Blame me if you want!"

"To compensate Phoebe, I've decided to transfer your shares in the club to her for free."

I looked at his still handsome and resolute face in shock, feeling like he was a stranger. Years ago, he used my payment of his medical bills as an excuse to repay me by picking me up from work every day.

Spending time together every day, I eventually fell for this resilient boy when he blocked a punch from a hospital troublemaker for me.

Upon learning about his tragic past, I worked part-time delivering food while interning at the hospital, using the money I earned to support his MMA dreams.

Once, an opponent dissatisfied with losing a fight stopped us in an alley after a match. In the confrontation, I saw a flash of a knife aimed at Jasper. My body reacted faster than my mind, and I shielded him. When I came to, the knife was already in my chest.

Jasper was terrified, trembling as he held me, begging the attackers to help get me to a hospital.

The knife missed my heart's aorta by just a centimeter, and I nearly met the Grim Reaper.

When I woke up, the first thing I saw was Jasper, red-eyed and haggard, by my bedside. He held my hand tightly, promising,

"Adeline, I, Jasper, will never let you down in this lifetime!"

During my recovery, staring dazedly at the scar on my chest in the mirror, Jasper hugged me from behind.

"Adeline, no matter how you change, you're always the most beautiful to me. And this scar, it's a testament to our love."

Remembering this, I looked at Jasper with tear-filled eyes, then unbuttoned my shirt to reveal the scar on my chest. My tears fell, landing on the ugly scar.

"Jasper... have you forgotten your own words..."

He shuddered, unable to meet my eyes or look at my scar, fleeing the office.

After that day, Jasper didn't return home for several days.

One night, after being called in for extra surgeries, I was heading home late when I felt someone following me. I ran in panic, ending up in a dead-end alley.

When I tried to return the way I came, the group following me surrounded me. A man with a scarred face spoke up first.

"Miss, don't blame us for being rough. Someone paid a lot to teach you a lesson."

I tried to escape but was pushed to the ground. That's when I saw a familiar figure at the alley's entrance.

"Jasper! Help me!"

I saw him walking toward me, but the thugs parted to let him through.

Jasper stopped in front of me and spoke softly.

"Adeline, I know I've wronged you and Phoebe, but after the miscarriage, Phoebe's been unwell. She's been saying she wants to join the child."

"I've arranged for them to just break your right hand, to give Phoebe some peace."

"I promise I won't divorce you. You'll still be my Mrs. Jasper."

Stunned, I looked at the man before me, disbelief in my voice.
"Jasper! Help me!"

I saw him walking toward me, and to my surprise, the thugs parted to let him through.

Jasper stood before me and spoke in a low voice. "Adeline, I've wronged both you and Phoebe. But since Phoebe's miscarriage, she's been unwell. She's been insisting on leaving with the child."

"I've talked to them. They'll only break your right hand to give Phoebe some closure."

"I promise I won't divorce you. You'll remain my wife."

I stared at him in disbelief and said, "Jasper, you know if my right hand is injured, I won't be able to perform surgery again."

"Don't worry, Adeline. Even if you can't be a doctor anymore, I'll always take care of you."

With that, as if he couldn't bear to witness what would happen next, he turned and walked away without looking back.

I screamed loudly in the alley, hoping for help, but they quickly covered my mouth.

They held me down and broke my right hand.

But they didn't stop there. After breaking my hand, they continued to beat me until I felt a wetness below.

Seeing the blood pooling around me, they panicked and fled.

I lay in the dark, damp alley, using the last of my strength to call Finn.

When I awoke, Finn was by my bedside, his eyes red. He spoke, his voice catching.

"Adeline, don't be too upset. There will be other chances for children..."

"And your right hand... the tendon and nerve damage is irreversible. It will be difficult for you to hold a scalpel again."

"But it's okay. You're still young. You can explore other fields in medicine..."

Finn's comforting words were interrupted by Phoebe's sudden arrival.

"Adeline! How did you get hurt like this?"

I made up an excuse to send Finn away. Before leaving, he turned and gave Phoebe a lingering look.

With my hand hidden under the blanket, I discreetly activated the recording on my phone.

Once Finn was gone, she dropped the pretense.

"Adeline, you're prettier and more educated than me, but what does that matter?"

"Jasper still broke your right hand for me. To tell you the truth, that child wasn't even Jasper's."

"See how much I love him? I won't have a child that's not his~"

Hearing footsteps approaching, she quickly changed her tone and put on an innocent face.

"Adeline, even though you caused my child's death, I don't blame you..."

Jasper came over and put an arm around her shoulder, speaking softly.

"You're always so kind, willing to give others a chance..."

Then he coaxed her to leave first.

After Phoebe left, he gently touched my casted right arm.

"Adeline, Phoebe just lost the baby. She needs my comfort."

"Once this is over, I'll break it off with her. We can live well together."

Looking at his shameless face, I suddenly burst into laughter, tears streaming down.

"Jasper, I don't want to be with you anymore."

Seeing me like this, he suddenly panicked. Just as he was about to explain, Phoebe's voice echoed from the hallway.

"Jasper! My stomach hurts!"

That day, Jasper hurriedly carried Phoebe away, leaving only a brief remark.

"Adeline, don't overthink. I'll explain everything when I get back."

But just like countless times waiting for him to return from socializing, I sat on the hospital bed until late at night, and he never came back.

He didn't even know that on that very night, I lost not only my right hand but also the last bond between us.

As the first rays of morning light touched my face, I took out my phone and made plans with Finn to leave in a week.

When Finn came to change my dressing, he accidentally left his phone in my room.

I was about to return it to him when I saw his phone wallpaper: a photo of him with Phoebe.

"Do they know each other?"

On an impulse, I used Phoebe's birthday as a password and unlocked Finn's phone.

At the top of Snapchat was his chat with Phoebe.

[Are you really going to the USA with that woman for me and Jasper?]

[What if she finds out you hired the guys who broke her right hand, making her unable to hold a scalpel?]

[I'm sorry to Adeline. I'll accompany her to the USA for rehab. I'll spend my life making it up to her!]

[The life-saving debt you owed me as a child, I've repaid you now.]

[You and Jasper can be together. Adeline and I will never return.]

[Finn, but I'm still scared. After all, I lost her mother's liver donor years ago.]

[Don't worry. I covered it up well back then. Adeline won't find out.]

...

Standing there with the phone, I felt cold all over, a chill spreading in my heart.

In my junior year, my mother died of liver failure. Before she died, the hospital said a liver donor had been found.

But just before my mom entered the operating room, Finn told me there was a system error, and there was no matching liver donor.

I didn't doubt him then. I collapsed in his arms, crying.

Now, looking at the chat, I wiped my tears, prepared two gift boxes, and changed my flight.

A week later, at the time Finn and I had planned to meet, I didn't show up at the airport. He called several times, but I didn't answer.

In the end, Finn only found a similarly anxious Jasper. Having finally calmed Phoebe, he was both physically and mentally exhausted, hoping to find comfort in me, only to discover I was long gone.

Jasper rushed over, grabbing Finn by the collar.

"Where's Adeline! Where did you take her?"

Finn just laughed coldly, his attitude enraging Jasper, who then punched him repeatedly until Phoebe arrived and pulled them apart.

They didn't know that three days ago, I had already landed in the UK.

After Jasper and Finn returned home, each received a gift from Adeline.  

Jasper opened the box to find a signed divorce agreement from Adeline and a pregnancy test report.  

He was dumbfounded as he looked at what was inside, finally realizing that Adeline was serious about leaving him this time.
